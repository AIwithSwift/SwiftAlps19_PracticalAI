Neg, In 1992 we bought a new Taurus and we really loved it  So in 1999 we decided to try a new Taurus  I did not care for the style of the newer version  but bought it anyway I do not like the new car half as much as i liked our other one  Thee dash is much to deep and takes up a lot of room  I do not find the seats as comfortable and the way the sides stick out further than the strip that should protect your card from denting It drives nice and has good pick up  But you can not see the hood at all from the driver seat and judging and parking is difficult  It has a very small gas tank I would not buy a Taurus if I had it to do over  I would rather have my 1992 back  I don t think the style is as nice as the the 1992  and it was a mistake to change the style  In less than a month we had a dead battery and a flat tire br br  
Neg, The last business trip  I drove to San Francisco  I went to Hertz Rentals and got a 1999 Ford Taurus  thinking it looked comfortable and professional  I found the seating to be uncomfortable for myself  as well as for my passenger Now  seating comfort may not be important to you  but it is to me The fuel usage was fine  the car did get us there with no problems  but  it was such an uncomfortable ride for both of us  It is not as though I am hard to fit into a car  I am 5 5  weigh 115 pounds  and I am usually quite comfortable in most any car  But  the Taurus seemed especially uncomfortable  For anyone who is thinking of renting a car for a long trip  I would suggest that the Ford Taurus  1999  not be on the list of  be sure to get this There was a large trunk that allowed us to pack a lot of materials needed for the business end of the trip  Driving it was a breeze  and everything  worked  right  I have no complaints about the standard making of the car  except in the comfort area  How important is comfort to you  On a long trip  being an uncomfortable driver is distracting to me  and it made the trip seem unnecessarily longer than it should have felt  I make this trip a lot  The Saturn would have been a better choice for me  as I have rented this model quite often  It offers comforts that the Taurus simply does not have If you are planning a long trip  or to buy a car that you intend to be comfortably seated in  check out the Taurus on a longer trial basis than you might another car  You may find the same thing happening to your comfort  
Neg, My husband and I purchased a 1990 Ford F250 and had nothing but problems  we have owned the vehicle approximately two years and it has spent at least half of that time in the shop The first problem was the valve covers were leaking  This problem took three days in the shop  When we went to pick it up  we found that the mechanic at the dealership did not replace parts that he had to take off  This took an additional week  Because of the poor design  fixing this vehicle was not found to be cheap  nor could just any mechanic do the work Next   within one week  the serpentine belt came off the pulleys and sheared off the air conditioning power plug  This also took nearly a week to fix  Cause of this problem was unknown Next  the clean air pump broke  again within a week  This took about four days to fix  When I picked up the truck after the air pump  I didn t realize at the time that the mechanic had not hooked back up a hose to the transmission  So  after driving it for three days  my transmission needed to be rebuilt  Due to unavailable parts  a new transmission replaced the old  Which was mated to a junk yard transfer case  This repair took about 5 days Truck vibrates at about 70 miles an hour  so we spent  1700  on a new front end  tires  balancing etc  This did not help the situation Within two weeks the serpentine belt was replaced for the second time since I bought the vehicle  The truck had 98 000 miles when I took over so I expected some problems don t get me wrong  but newer vehicles are said too have 200 000 mile motor s I noticed a large loss of power after said repairs  then began the costly fixes and diagnostics to find cause of power loss  The gas mileage at this point is about 10mpg never increasing the belt replacement continued till the present date at a belt every month  The truck went into the shop again for transmission leaks to a ford dealership where the problems found mounted  Once again unavailable and discontinued parts This is not even close to being all of the problems  but I think I ve said enough     
Neg, I feel I have a thorough opinion of this truck compared to most who post evaluations of their vehicles  My truck has been owned by me since new and currently have 75k miles  I ve been meticulous with maintenance and treating my truck with normal duty activities  never exceeding the manufacturer s recommendations This is information regarding my vehicle and the excessive amount of problems found during an inspection 15 Sept 2003  It s reference for anyone else who has had the same problems or looking for information regarding warranties and extended warranties  You are welcome to give some feedback  VEHICLE  2000 FORD F150 5 4L 4x4 XLT w  Off Road   Tow Package 17  Rims  Everything factory install  all the top options included  EXTENDED WARRANTY  Purchased FORD s version 75K mile Bumper to Bumper coverage when new  50 deductible per drive in occurrence  DRIVING CONDITIONS  Never taken off road  Never towed anything of significant weight and Never used inappropriately Toward the last 400 miles of my 75K mile Ford purchased extended warranty bumper to bumper plan  the passenger side power door lock failed and the ABS light turned on  I brought it in to the dealer for an inspection along with some squeeking of the front end  thought it was a tire rim leak  PROBLEMS FOUND 1  All 4 tie rods  inners and outers  bad 2  Lower ball joints  bad 3  ABS Codes C1095 and C1096  ECU and HCU Controller and Module Assembly  bad 4  Passenger side door lock actuator  bad 5  Power Steering Pump  bad  air conditioning warranty replaced back at 30k miles  All items above were replaced under the purchased extended warranty bumber to bumber plan  EXCEPT a kit for the module assembly on the ABS  I will dispute that today  but had to pay for it to get it done  I am shocked that this much damage was found for a vehicle at only 75k miles proclaimed to be  Built Ford Tough  yet only offering a 36K mile manufacturer warranty  If I did not have the extended warranty  I could only guess the bill to pay for this The extended cab seating is extremely cramped  My friends refuse to be a passenger in the back  The rear bench seating is hard  very uncomfortable  General Motors seems to have very comfortable and roomy seating in their comparable models  The ignition is hidden and difficult to find  The stereo is second class for sound and tuning stations  especially AM  Factory installed tires have no significant grip traction after 10 000 miles  I recommend getting a spray in liner to help prevent the large dents and scratches that have happened in my truck  but not trucks that have been sprayed  The metal can t hold up and appears thin for the bed I do like the exterior look of the F150  The height is fantastic  I can see all around while driving  it certainly upsets small vehicle drivers behind me  tailgating me and assuming I m a slow road hog in the left lane  but when trying to pass  they see the road jammed full of cars in front of me  bumper to bumper  Accelerations and towing torque are very good  Although now I sense a loss or hesitation on a occasions when I have to suddenly put the petal to the medal to avoid accidents Expect to pay the value of your truck in maintenance costs from the dealer  They make their money on repairs and maintenance  very expensive  I m not complaining about this  but you buy and expensive truck  expect to pay for the maintenance  
Neg, AS a mother of 3  all of whom are still in carseats  the only logical thing to do was to trade in my 200sx for a minivan  As the minivan is only one of a handful of vehicles that have the room my family requires  In addition  We bought a new one so the mechanical difficulties would be minimum I love the fact that the van seats so many people  I never have to worry about bringing 2 cars  Even if I have me kids with me the van seats added passengers  It does so in a roomy way as well I like the way the Windstar handles  It has great acceleration  I like the fact that you are able to see way infront of you while driving  But these features are almost always indicative of all vans  or at least most of them I hate the fact that this vehicle has broken down 4 times leaving myself and my children STRANDED on the side of the road  Each time we brought it back to the dealer where they said they fixed it  Each diagnosis was different  The engine lights continues to go on  to this day  This makes it difficult if not impossible for me to feel safe in the Windstar  Thankfully  my husband is quite mechanical The Windstar handles well  It is easy to steer and control  much like driving a car  Some vans have steering that is difficult The suspension on the Windstar leaves something to be desired  I have the privledge of feeling every bump The brakes are sound  I have yet to have them fail or squeak severly People who should buy this vehicle are those with alot of children or who need to transport alot of things  Anyone who enjoys sports cars   fast vehicles  should avoid this car br br  
Neg, The Ford Winstar is a car that I would not recommend purchasing  I have driven this van several times and I can t get used to it  The handling is horrible do to it s swaying feeling  It actually feels like the car is going to tip over in some turns  The side passenger window creates a blind spot  which I think is dangerous  Where the side window meets the windshield is where I think the problem is  When braking it also feels like the driver doesn t have control do to the car having a difficult time stopping quick  This car doesn t stop efficiently  it doesn t handle well and it also doesn t provide the driver with a very good frame of vision on the passenger side  I feel that this is a safety hazard not only to the driver and their passengers but also to everyone else on the road  Not recommended by me br br  
Neg, We bought this van in 1999  after having been a rental since it s  birth  Initially we loved it  It was everything we had dreamed about and more  There was plenty of room for 7 and rode extremely nice  even in the very back  We had heard nothing but good about this van  it s safety ratings  ease of driving  etc  It was the GL model  and had rear heat air and stereo controls  The front seats were bucket  while the two in back were bench  Everything about it was wonderful UNTIL We had around 70 000 miles on it and the transmission went out of it  Things seemed to roll downhill from there  We replaced the tranny and a few weeks later the interior of the sliding door fell off  It had constant problems with the ignition switch and was always dinging whether or not the keys were in it  the lights were on  whatever  The interior lights stayed on all the time as well  The door ajar light was always on  no matter what was done to ensure that all the doors were closed  No lie  a few times this van even started itself when the keys weren t even in it  The gas mileage was only about 17 18 mpg  The air conditioning would literally run you out it got so cold  We never did have any problems with the air or heat  It rode very nice  and drove very nice  but all in all  I d say it definately wasn t worth the money paid  and was more of a headache than it was worth  
Neg, I bought the Focus wagon for it s cargo space  It s great for camping and the hardware store  The ride is smooth and quiet  and it handles quite well  It has a solid feel compared to our Lancer  I wish the gas mileage were a little better  It does have nice features like an adjustable seat belt height in the front seat  big door pockets  seat warmers  The windshield wiper is still the best on the market  The biggest problem I have is that it leaks terribly in the back  I plan to take it in to get that fixed  I have had to clean the trunk carpet twice with a bleach solution to kill the mold mildew that has set in  The other issue I have is that the vent allows too much engine heat through in the summertime  This is a bummer if you are expecting cool air in the spring or fall to come through  The sun visors are almost useless as they do not go all the way forward  They sag too low and block too much of the road  I went from a Ford Escort wagon to this car  The Focus feels like a luxury car compared to the Escort  I will give this car a chance  If the leak cannot be fixed  I ll look for another car  
Neg, You ve probably heard about the giant 2000 Ford Excursion sport utility vehicle  which carries a significant price tag which relates to its size  According to safety experts  when you spot the Excursion on the road  pull off the asphalt after having wet your pants in fear and hide in the gutter to avoid any chance of making contact with a machine so big it feasts on coupes for snacks  and sedans for entrees  The Excursion isn t a utility vehicle meant to haul large families and large things that smaller vehicles can t  Only about 50 000 will be built the first year Excursion s strong point  its huge size  is also drawing criticism  It took a 310 horsepower V 10 to maneuver the 19 foot  Excursion over winding roads with minimal strain  Not sure if the base 5 4 liter  255 h p  would have fared as well  Ford estimates that the 5 4 liter will deliver 10 to 11 mpg city highway  the 6 8 liter 15 to 16 mpg  and the 7 3 liter turbo diesel 17 to 18 mpg With boat attached  the V 10 performed admirably  which  after all  is why Excursion exists  to provide those  who need to tow big  heavy things  a big  heavy vehicle  Once the boat was unhooked  the V 10 managed twisty  hilly roads without coming up for air  But even without a boat  Excursion isn t going to run from the light  The suspension has a tendency to be firm but has been adjusted to prevent bone jarring movement on uneven pavement  Handling is surprisingly pleasant  The steering offers  low effort movement  to balance out the size and weight without being so loose you don t feel in control  But don t expect to take a tight corner with ease as you would in say  an Explorer  And the turning radius is  well  let s just say you ll need three to four lanes for a U turn  Excursion comes with four wheel  anti lock  disk brakes  Even with normal braking  be sure to apply the pedal earlier to account for its size  There will be some who complain Excursion is too big  They probably will be the owners of tiny vehicles frightened by the Excursion  In my test drive  the Excursion never grabbed another vehicle and slung it from my path In back  the standard trailer hitch and associated hardware was designed to sit low to keep vehicles from submarining under Excursion in a rear end impact  Excursion is garageable  if the garage is at least 20 feet deep and the door at least 7 feet high  Inside  Excursion has three rows of seats to handle eight passengers  nine if you decide to go for a front bench seat rather than a massive center section with a writing top  4 cup holders for front and rear passengers  and enough room inside for tape CD coin holders plus the optional six CD changer  Entry to the third seat is easy  Press the handle and the second seat back lowers and the bottom slides forward for wide open entry exit in back  However  once in the third row  you are directly over the rear axle  putting you in touch with all the road harshness  Other features include a full size spare inside along the side wall that still allows a decent amount of room  and folding second and third seats increase cargo capacity  The third seat is on rollers so it can be removed or folded against the back of the second seat for more cargo room  and it contains tons of room behind the third seat for luggage or golf clubs without removing it  Other goodies include 10 cup holders  5 power plugs  4 coat hooks  second and third row reading lamps  rear cabin audio controls with dual headphone jacks  overhead console for garage door opener and eyeglass holders  Despite excellent glass hatch visibility  there s one glaring problem in back on Excursion  It stands so tall I lost sight of a BMW Z 3 that pulled up behind me at the light  which means objects such as pets or kids that are even smaller won t be seen when you back out of the driveway  Ford offers a sonar reverse sensing system on the Windstar mini van that beeps to warn of objects when backing up  It should already be here  but it will be offered on Excursion  hopefully  soon  If you have kids  you might want to wait for it  Dual air bags are standard with Belt Minder  which sounds a chime every 30 seconds as a reminder to buckle up  The Excursion is offered at a starting price of  33 460 for 2WD  and  36 775 for 4WD     
Neg, If you thought that the GMC Chevrolet Suburban was big  wait till you see the 2000 Ford Excursion  This vehicle dwarfs even the biggest of all SUV s  And in the race for the biggest and the baddest SUV s Ford takes the cake  Outside the vehicle closely resembles the Ford F350 with its front and grill  There is plenty of chrome to make it glitzy enough  It s big  The step in height is high even for a tall individual  and it takes quite some effort to get in  The tailgate is gigantic with two doors that swing wide out to the sides  Once inside  you will be lucky if you can get inside  you will notice an abundance of space  but it s not much more than the smaller Suburban  It s comfortable  but again a Dodge Caravan is just as nice in the inside as my opinion  The Limited version has a leather and wood interior and seating for up to nine  although most cars are outfitted for seven on eight people  It is comfortable and there enough space even in the way back  The vehicle is powerful enough for passing effectively on the highways and is comparable to the Suburban in accleration  But the handling  the handling is TERRIBLE  It s a truck  it s a truck disguised as a SUV  It s hard to maneuver  and the turning radius is horrible  If you are in the market for a vehicle with a lot of room  and with all wheel drive that can handle in the snow  a much better choice than the Excursion is the Dodge Caravan with all wheel drive  It s better on your wallet too  with a better price and its much better gas mileage br br  
Neg, I went for a test drive in a 2000 Excursion with the Eddie Bauer trim package with a friend who is looking to buy an SUV pretty soon  I ve always owned coupes and just one sedan in my lifetime  so this was very different for me  when i got behind the wheel so he cound ride in the back and check it out  I has a mix of feelings  I did feel like I was in tank or something because I was ridding high and felt the sheer magnitude of the truck as being something that was confidence inspiring  However  I didn t feel like I ws in control of the vehicle  Stoppng disances were super long and if something or someone happen to dart out in front of the truck  there was no way to safely swerve and aviod a most likely fatal collion with the victim  The truck rides nicely for it s size  The feel is very firm considering how large it is  The interior was done very nicely in leather trim  but I didn t at all like how it s simply kind of a dressed up Ford super duty truck interior  If you re paying over 36K for this thing  you deserve a little more exclusivisity  The exterior styling is very nice rough and rugged  The taillings are a little too similar to the econoline vans  but that s okay I suppose  My friend lives in a rural area and is involved in shipping large equipment on trailers  so it s the right kind of truck for him  However  I think people that simply buy this thing to use as a status symbol are pretty shallow and basically stupid  I don t see the logic is sayign you ve got the biggest and baddest truck out there when you have to pay over  60 to fill er up and use it to do things like go to the mall and take drive to work in alone while burning gasoline galore in gridlock  I d imagine parking this thing is a nightmare in tight urban spaces a parallel park might require one of those guys at the airport that guide the planes in with lighted torches  This vehicle also inspires a sense of false security and superiority in the event of a collision  People just simply think  quot If I crash  the other guy will die haha quot that might be true  but you ll pay later aside from the legal consequences  depending on if it was your fault you will have to live with the fact that because of the vehicle choice you made  you may have cripple  injured  or possibly even killed someone out there  The thing that s most frightening about this truck is that people who buy it in the city tend to be the type that chat away on cell phones all of the time that habit combined with the desructive potential of this thing can and will lead to many tragedies  You d think that the problem of teh wrong type of buyer getting this thing would be solved by the high gasoline prices  but that doesn t seem to be the case perhaps if we see prices over  2 50 per gallon  Bottom line  Ford made a good truck here  but it can t play big brother to control who buys people really need to become aware of the fact that SUV s do have dangers associted with them  i e  rollovers are more common  and make better choices  In the hands of the right buyer this truck is great     
Neg,  This segment added later It appears as though Ford is FINALLY coming to terms on its SUV line  They admitted that their SUV s were not as safe and environmentally friendly as they should be and will take steps to make them safer for the occupants  other drivers and the environment  Another interesting twist  Ford JUST THIS WEEK decided to reduce production of Excursion by 25  That is not a small percentage  I saw this happening long ago  This is the first step in dropping the line all together  Any guesses on the value of the Excursion you just bought when that happens  Maybe William Ford Jr read my Epinion and decided to take action All I know is there is one more company to add to my DO NOT BUY STOCK list The purpose of Epinions is to post an opinion that may help someone make or not make a purchase  I hope my opinion will prevent someone from purchasing an Excursion  I don t own one  and wouldn t  I m not sure if I d even test drive one  I haven t yet anyway  This shouldn t detract from my view however  For example one need not be a Cuban or Cuban American to have an opinion on Elian and whether he should go home or stay here  Opinions are after all one sided  Some will agree with me  some will not  Personally  I take the stand of I really don t care if you buy an Excursion or not  but if you do buy one take responsibility for what may happen High gas prices  tough  Kill or injure someone in an accident  gt  GO TO JAIL  do not pass go  do not collect  200  Ford shouldn t have built it in the first place  The managers at Ford should have looked a little further than  quot today quot  to analyze buying trends  Especially ones set by Texans  we as a group are statistically not the smartest of the bunch  I just live here  was born in Indiana  Traditionally  all new trucks are tested and marketed in Texas first  Instead of building the biggest on the block  they could have made a different statement  Ford has done this many times and always looses their shorts on it  To this end they should have realized that fuel prices couldn t be cheap forever  infact it should be at least  2 00 a gallon anyway  We ve been spoiled by cheap gas that the automakers don t market fuel efficient vehicles here  but yet you can buy several cars that get 50  mpg in Europe  Even the Suburban  which is still not great  claims to get 18 mpg on the highway much higher than the estimates of around 10 12 the dealers tell of  In the Dallas Fort Worth area  dealers are offering more than  5000 off on them  which means that they aren t selling them  Within 2 years I don t think the Excursion will be built any longer  Excursions don t have to post gas mileage at all  They don t have to even conform with EPA regulations  And by stating that is it a LEV  low emission vehicle  must be a comparison to a coal burning power plant  There is no way you can burn so much fuel and produce as much pollution as a Honda  come on The Excursion s gas mileage doesn t even bother me that much  Heck  not too long ago  I owned a 1974 Cadillac HEARSE  yes it had dead people in it at one time  It only got 7 miles per gallon  I not once complained about it  What irritates me is the people whining about fuel prices who do drive these vehicles  When ever there is something on the news about gas prices there is ALWAYS someone griping but has a big ole truck My BIG issue is the safety issue  Clearly these trucks are dangerous to other cars  The automakers just last month publicly recognized this fact and are making steps to prevent deaths  Why couldn t they have done this earlier  I could care less if a stupid person kills them self  in any vehicle  but when they kill someone else that really bothers me  Especially so when they purchase a vehicle that they are not capable of driving unfortunately this is many times  quot soccer moms quot  They want a sense of security and safety  They have an Excursion full of arguing kids  they have an added distraction of a cell phone and other stuff  Yes  they are completely safe to its occupants  but what about the guy in the Miata she just plowed through  Any vehicle which has to have a bar put under the front and rear bumpers to keep it from  quot monster trucking quot  over smaller cars is inherently not safe to others  no matter what you do One good thing I saw was that there was a guy in California that was charged and convicted of manslaughter for killing someone in an accident because he had a big SUV and a phone and went through a red light and killed someone  Finally a jury that did the right thing br br  
Neg, SUV s  SOB s and PMS great what a deadly combination  Now the old mad woman on the cell phone has something larger to hit her target w  I can t eescribe how angry i am w  these tanks going down the road just waiting to slam into my 1 off show truck  I wanted to see what this was all about so I test drove one  There wasn t one blind spot there were FIVE  I just can t see how anyone would want to drive one of these  I feel that if you are going to spend  40 000 on something why not buy some thing stylish and comfortable  i mean come on Cadillac offers night vision now how cool is that br br  
Neg, Hey everybody  I don t own this car  I haven t ever driven this car  But I do have opinions about it  and I might as well share them My car is a Saturn SL1  go read my review  a car that is constantly subjected to being blinded at night by SUVs and trucks coming up behind us  This is an annoying problem  maybe one that Saturn should address  but still something of a concern  And I love trucks  I wanted a truck  before I got my car  and maybe someday I ll get one anyway  I m not in any way implying that there s any reason not to make trucks But the Excursion  named Big Truck by some of my friends  is simply too big  If you live where I live  you just don t need this vehicle  most likely  and you re endangering all of us by just driving it  I d like to know why half of the parents in my town bought their Excursions  whether it was for safety  or trendiness  or because minivans just aren t cool anymore  I d like to start a discussion about these mammoth SUVs so that they don t just keep getting bigger and bigger  so that eventually cars and trucks can be of compatible sizes and not create major problems for each other just by sharing a road The excursion is intimidating  and maybe that s what s appealing to some people  If one is near me on the highway  I want to get away from it  I do not believe they can see me  in my smaller car  and I don t want to get crushed  I ll do whatever I can to avoid an Excursion  and I m no meek flower of a driver  These cars are apt to roll over  can t stop quickly  and the blind spots are tremendous I have seen the most amazing sights concerning the Excursion  One day I was in a parkinglot behind one  and I sat mezermerized as big truck tried to fit into a rather wide space  It took more than seven adjustments  back out  pull in  back out  for Big Truck to park crookedly  and there was absolutely no room for me to squeeze by  Then  another day  in another parking lot  I saw a ten year old kid try to hop up into the passenger s side of the truck  He missed the seat and fell right onto the ground  I don t doubt that this happens all the time  I had a hard time not thinking about my tiny grandmother trying to get into this tremendous truck  A simple footstool  like the one she uses to get into our Plymouth Voyager  wouldn t be enough to even reach the Excursion s step  Big Truck is much too big Please  Excursion lovers  don t hunt me down to run me over with your truck  I m not trying to take away anyone s fun or anyone s vehicle  I just wish that people would think a lot harder before buying into the Excursion club  The power is appealing  the size is apalling  buying this truck makes you responsible for driving in a whole new way  If you need an Excursion  surely  go buy one  If you have to cart around ten people and a boat and luggage and some furniture all at once  by all means  get this truck  But please  keep in mind that not everyone on the road is in a Big Truck and that we have rights as well  Just don t buy this truck without a lot of heavy thought  
Neg, I bought this vehicle to have a safe vehicle to transport my three young children on the California freeways My excursion is a 2 wheel drive V10  I have had two major problems with this vehicle 1  The back end of the vehicle bounces from side to side whenever driving over a drain or small pothole in the road  I nearly lost control of the car driving on the 15 freeway at 55MPH  Ford has test driven the vehicle  acknowledged the problem and has refused to take the vehicle back  I think it is because they are nervous about receiving all of their vehicles back  Any 2 wheel drivers experiencing the same problem A test driver from the Dispute Settlement Board has driven the vehicle and another  quot like vehicle quot  and found the same problem  I am hoping that the board rules that Ford take the excursion back 2  All California excursions have a  quot flutter noise quot  that sounds like five holes in the exhaust  This information is in the auto s  quot Technical Service Bulletin quot  available at the dealer of purchase  Ford is aware of this problem and has no answer for it The dealer has informed us that this car really maintains control only when it is filled to capacity with adults and is towing a heavy load  They recommend lowering the tire pressure to below recommended levels  We have had and been extremely satisfied with the Ford Lynx  Sable  Explorer  Bronco and Expedition  I would not AT ALL recommend the excursion to anyone br br  
Neg, So it is the new fad for mothers to drive  Expeditions  Suburbans  Land Cruisers and now Excursions ok maybe it isnt a NEW fad  The Ford  quot Death Trap quot  Excursion is exactly how it sounds  It is a monster but is it really worth the extra  quot room quot  This thing is an incredible undertaking to drive  you must be constantly aware of everything around you  The truck barely fits within its allotted space  on the right side of the road  Built off of the frame of the F 250 truck  the Excursion has not particularly crash tested well either  I test drove one of these while helping a friend s family pick out a car  I must say that I cannot recommend it  No pickup  not that any is needed  and terrible turning radius  The extra insecurities are simply not worth its size  Whatever happened to the mini van  It s roomier  more comfortable  and more efficient  but it just doesnt seem to be in style anymore  Until then I believe every  quot soccer quot  mom feels its necessary to have a 4wd Expedition  Suburban  or Excursion  When driving the Excursion you will not be worried about your own safety  but those around you instead  Make sure you can handle the ridiculous size before you join in on the large SUV fad Oh yeah and good luck finding a parking spot br br  
Neg, Now I m no granola munchin  hippie but this beast of a car is a hazard to the environment and everyone else on the road  While it may be roomy  can easily fit 9 people  this means that the SUV must weigh 9 tons  The vehicle is over 7 feet tall and wider than most parking spaces  All of this excess means one thing  if you are involved in a accident with one of these you will probably be killed   It s like going up against a monster truck  Don t let Ford fool you either  these cars  SUV s in general  do not have any emissions standards so basically these things pollute as much a big rig  With the surge in the popularity of these things that means that the earth is becoming polluted at an even more alarming rate  So maybe the environment or the hazards to everyone else don t phase you  You have your mind set on one of these babies  Just check out the price and the gas mileage these things get  If you live in CT like me then the price of gas alone equals the price of the car in a few years if you drive at least 40 miles a day  All of these things means that this excess room is just costing everyone else including the owner  If it s room you want then get an RV or a van  Just not a stupid  ugly SUV br br  
Neg, I am going to start this off by telling you that I hate big cars  They guzzle gas like nobody s business  This one is in the 10 mpg range  They are a danger to anyone not in them on the road  and  despite their ludicrous size  they never have any room for their passengers  Ford s new Excursion is the worst of them all  This monstrosity is like something out of a horror film  When I see it on the road I expect it to start roaring and try to run me over  Seriously though  I feel like there is a genuine risk to my life when I am driving near an Excursion  and they are a horrible risk to the environment as well br br  
Neg,  drive these cars I don t care how many damn children you have  or how many boats you tow daily  this not a  necessary  car for ANYONE these trucks are eyesores and harmful to the environment  i m so far from an being eco terrorist  but these machines are inefficient  gas guzzlers that make the air nasty to breathe  bigger  better  deadlier  these are not SAFE cars  the momentum that a truck of this size has will give a whole new meaning to  whiplash  indeed these are long  too  long and tall  dangerous  because regular cars can t see the road ahead of them  and even worse that people have no idea how to HANDLE these things  why are these machines classified as class  B  vehicles  like yugos  volvos or fiats the only thing that makes me madder than the cars are the morons who feel the need to drive them  soccer moms have traded their piece of cak mini vans  which i m actually starting to MISS sharing the road with  compared to these suvs  explorer owners trade in for the expedition and the excursion  it s an endless cycle of mechanical penis envy  yuppie materialism  and blind faith in  SAFETY excuse me  i ve got to go  i ve got gastanks to urinate into   where s my stepladder  
Neg, Our big search for a larger vehicle started when I found out I was expecting another child  At the time  I was driving an old Volkswagon Bug and I had two children already  We looked at quite a few brands  The only one I didn t feel comfortable with was Ford s  I had heard a lot of negative feedback on those cars  When we saw the Aerostar on the lot  my husband wanted it right then  It was clean and comfortable with a sporty look  I wanted to look a little more  I researched it online to make sure we were getting a good deal  We had looked at  drove  and researched over a dozen before thinking about narrowing down our options  When the dealer lowered his price to what I felt was an awesome deal  we decided to buy it  For not wanting a Ford to begin with  I would have to say that this vehicle has been one of the best we have owned  It is very dependable and comfortable  The air conditioning and heating works well  It even has a windshield wiper on the back window  That is something I never had on any of my previous vehicles  The engine works wonderful  Not a squeak or grind anywhere  Though it is compacted into a small place  I am sure it wouldn t be that hard to fix if something did go wrong  I don t know much about the specifics of the engine  but it will change from car to car  so the specifics aren t as important here as the quality  Recently  we took out the back seat and went shopping for a very large toolbox for my husband s work  I couldn t believe we fit it in there with one of the back seats still in  I guess we don t need a truck after all UPDATED 11 24 00 My mind definitely changed within the 6 months we have owned this vehicle  Within a month  the door started having trouble closing  In about a month after that  the screws started falling out of the door and the panel was loose  The latch to close the door started sticking also about a month ago  The front passenger door has some problems also  The panel started falling out there as well  Though I have a lot of children  we do no more wear and tear on this vehicle than a mini van should be able to stand up to since it is made to carry children  I don t feel we are overly hard on it  Yet  the van keeps falling apart at an unbelievable pace  I will stick with my gut instincts next time and stay away from Ford vehicles br br  
Neg, We bought a 1994 van used in 1996  We fell in love with the beautiful conversion package  it was very unique  We received many  many complements and offers of purchase over the past few years  But our problems began within two weeks of purchase  The ABS system went out so we took it to be repaired and within the next two months it was out again  So to the shop it went  It was repaired again and lasted until the end of 1999  In 1999 the ABS system went  the rear end started going out  the air bag went out  and the transmission was slipping  This van was babied the whole time we had it  so we do not understand why all the problems  We knew people with older Ford vans who had 200 00 plus miles and not a bit of trouble  ours finally had hit 100 000 and was going out of commission  We have now traded our Ford for a Mercury Villager and absolutely love it  The Ford was nice for show  but that was about it  I will miss it  but now I don t have to fight the wind  put up with a slipping transmission  or worry about my airbags deploying when needed br br  
Neg, We bought a 97 Ford Ranger Extended Cab 4x4 because of its low price  And granted  it s a smooth ride  an attractive vehicle and the engine has started even on the coldest of mornings  But We live in the mountains and a four wheel drive vehicle is a must  After just two years  the hubs on our Ranger went out and cost us over  800 in repairs  The mechanic told us that Ford is notorious for these hub problems  a result of poor engineering of their shift on the fly 4x4 mechanism If you can live without a four wheel drive  then the low cost factor of the Ranger may outweigh this consideration  But if you re into off roading or just need to plow through winter snows  don t buy the Ranger 4x4 br br  
Neg, For generations the men in my family have insisted on purchasing Ford trucks  and usually buy the F 150 series  Sometimes the trucks where loaded with extras  but most of the time they bought just a plain unusual pickup truck with standard transmission  power brakes and power steering  and what they thought to be  a good solid engine and transmission True enough  when first purchased  these trucks looked great and were great to drive  The exterior was flawless  shiny  eye appealing  and had lots of showoff value  The performance during the first year of use was near perfect  And  of course  the owner was very proud to show off that new truck to his fellow hunters  fishermen  farmers  and offered everyone and their brother free rides But now  time has passed  and several years down the road and  lt 100 000 miles later  their tune has changed drastically  All the trucks have lost their luster  the paint is peeling off  numerous rust spots all over the cabs  roofs  and around the wheel covers  and the owners are frustrated and certainly don t have the money to have a new paint job  The standard transmissions all are failing miserably and the truck is often in the shop being repaired  The universal joints are going out  wrecking havoc in the life of the offshore worker who must be at work on time or face loosing a week s paycheck  But the most common problem that has appeared in EVERY Ford truck that they have own is the sudden stalling out in traffic  Push the gas pedal and the truck just stalls out and dies  rather than go forward  The trucks can NEVER be trusted to go into first gear and leap forward with any amount of speed safely My advice is to talk with long time Ford truck owners and way the pros and cons heavily before buying a truck that you expect to perform for many years to come br br  
Neg, I thought it was odd that the front and back brakes as well as the rotors all went out before hitting 20K miles  Also  we had to call the CEO of our local dealer because their service center said that the factory warranty wouldn t cover the cost  The repair bill was  550 00 but the CEO saw it our way after much arguing  and we didn t have to pay it  I guess they didn t like us too much  because when we picked up the truck  there was bird poop all over the inside of the truck  and it had a flat tire  We owned a 1997 F 150 Offroad prior to this one  and like this truck  the window mechanism on the passenger side tends to go out early on  This truck has been in the shop 3 or 4 times since we ve had it  not quite 1 year old  just the deal with the brakes sucked  The radiator had to be replaced at 5K miles  and the transmission was leaking fluid like crazy too  It is a comfy truck with a lot of room  looks good  but the reason I won t buy another is simply because of the service  the crappy way we were treated     
Neg, I was driving a 1987 Honda CRX that was about to die  and needed something quickly  so I hit a dealer specializing in used police cars  figuring I d get something inexpensive and interesting  I picked up a 1991 police package  formerly owned by the Connecticut state police  Since the car was only going to be driven a few hundred miles a week  price was the main concern When the car was running  it was a lot of fun  Good acceleration  lots of  quot luxury quot  features that the Honda didn t have  and interesting responses from other drivers  Unfortunately  the bad outweighed the good The police package was the only Crown Vic in 1991 with a carburetor  Not only was it a carburetor  but an engineering nightmare known as a variable venturi  The one I had was going bad  The local Ford dealer wouldn t touch it  saying that the best that they could do was replace it  at a cost of  1100  I did manage to find a mechanic who specialized in them and only charged  500 to rebuild the one I had  Eventually  all of the major systems on the car were replaced  one at a time  just to keep the car operating When it was running  the handling wasn t particularly good  the breaking was poor  and the ride was soft  I can t even imagine what a standard Crown Vic would drive like  The acceleration was awesome  but at less then 20 miles per gallon  stepping on the gas was an expensive proposition If you re looking for an inexpensive luxury car  don t stop off at the local used police car salesman  The sticker price isn t even close to what it will cost in the end br br  
Neg, I just bought a used 1996 Crown Victoria Police Interceptor and am not a very happy camper  I belong to a volunteer highway safety organization and was in the market for a new  used police car as my  93 Ford Taurus was on it s last legs  After spending several weeks searching all over trying to find a used Crown Vic police car to my liking and that did not break the bank I finally found one at a dealer located two hours away from my home  The dealer who specializes only in used police cars was highly recommended by a friend of mine who has bought three cars from him and has been very satisfied with the cars overall So  after two trips up to the dealer and looking at dozens of cars on the lot  I settled on a  96 Crown Vic police intercepter model with 95 000 miles on it and a rebuilt transmission  Part of the catch was the price which was several thousand dollars less than I thought I d end up paying  This car seemed perfect in every sense for what I wanted and needed  The only problem was that I wasn t able to test drive it on the road because it hadn t been properly prepped  So I was limited to driving it around in the parking lot of the dealership  It seemed fine in the lot  but the lot and a road are two different dimensions when it comes to testing a car s handling  You may say that I should ve known better  but I figured that a car with a police package was supposed to handle well Before making the final decision on the Crown Vic  the dealer suggested that I test drive a  95 Caprice police car he just prepped for a sale latter that day  He mentioned that the Caprices handle better than the Crown Vics  I took the Caprice for a spin and the handling seemed nice and the engine was amazing  But  I had my heart set on the Crown Vic I ve just always liked the look of it much better  and figured that there would be little difference in handling between the Caprice and the Crown Vic because after all  both cars had police packages  Boy  was I ever wrong  The day I picked up my Crown Vic it had been completely checked over and prepped by the dealer  I was eager to take it for a spin on the open road to see how it handled before handing over the check  To my surprise the steering seemed unusually oversensitive and the car seemed to ride very awkwardly around bends  The dealer reassured me that  that was typical of the Crown Vics and it was possible that the car just needed an alignment  I figured that I d just have to get used to the different handling  So  I handed over the check and drove home with the my new  used Crown Vic  A few days later  I took it in to my trusted local mechanic to have it looked over with special attention to the steering s oversensitivity problem and my mechanic said everything seemed to have checked out okay  He couldn t find anything really wrong with the vehicle that might cause steering or handling problems and he came to the same conclusion as the dealer   that Crown Vics were just built that way Well  now I feel kind of confused and upset because I had expected the Crown Vic  especially the police package  to handle much more nimbly overall  My  93 Ford Taurus with 140 000 miles on it  shot front shocks  a ball joint and tie rod about to go and power steering that gave out long ago still handled better for the most part than this Crown Vic  In a way I wish I had gotten the Caprice  but I didn t know better at the time My advise to anyone considering purchasing a used Crown Vic police car  or for that matter any used car  is to test drive it thoroughly and see if you can live with it s handling  I ll have to try to learn to live with the Crown Vic s handling unless I choose to sell it which I m not quite ready to do yet  The reason being that in the last 24 hours I found some useful forums and sites on the internet that discuss problems with the Crown Vic police packages and some suggestions on correcting them  So to end on a little bit of a positive note  there still may be hope for this Crown Vic and me  But  I don t have a lot of free time in my life to devote to fine tuning a car to ride decently that should have been built that way to begin with  I will be far more careful next time before jumping into a car purchase based mostly on my preconceived conceptions and test driving limited to the parking lot  p s  One owner of the same year and version of my car responded to a message for help I posted on a used police car bulletin board and he suggested having the alignment done by a mechanic that is familiar with the special needs of a police package vehicle  He said that having the alignment done properly on his Crown Vic improved the handling enough so that he decided to hang on to it  I will update this review as soon as I have the alignment done on my car in the next week or so br br  
Neg, The Crown Victoria is a breed that s siblings are dying fast  The only major competetors in it s category is the Lincoln Town Car and the Ill fated Chevrolet Caprice Classic  It s twin the Mercury Gran Marquis shares many of the same characteristics as the crown vic  Acceleration is very sluggish for a car of it s heft  The underpowered v 6 whines when the gas pedal is pushed  Where it lack s in perofrmance it is justified by the comfort and roominess  All ergonomics are well placed and simple  This car is designed for the grandma that hates  quot All Those Gadgets quot  It s forward bench seat is comfortable and squishy  But firm enough to support your grandma s Aching Hips  If you are still in your prime years I would stay away from this car unless you like the bulky fleet car look     
Neg, I purchased a used 1992 high top with all the toys  t v  vcr  nintendo  remotes  queen size fold down bed  built in oak cabinets  built in coolers  all the goodies of the tiarra package  It was absolutely beautiful  I purchased it with the intention of enjoying it while traveling to Florida from Ohio  Never did make it though  You see  it didn t like warm weather for some reason  It stalled every single time the temperature outside reached 73 or higher  I would have to pull over to the side of the road and wait about 20 min  then go on my way again for another hour or so before it would stall again  I had it to 4 shops which all said it was fine and no Ford dealer within miles believed a word I said  I replaced computer components 2x  over  3000 of my own money  and the problem never went away  I replaced brakes on it as often as I changed the oil  I wanted badly to sell the van but felt aweful at the idea of someone else getting as stuck with it as I was  I finally traded it in for a new Dodge van and the day I did  everything in it shorted out  The t v  wouldn t work  the vcr wouldn t work  the seats wouldn t move  and yet all the fuses were tested and checked out to be fine  The service men at 3 shops that day told me they could find no reason whatsoever for the things not being perfectly normal because it showed power going to all areas as if totally normal  What s worse though was the lousy 9 mpg I got  It was terribly expensive to drive  to insure  and to keep up  Too bad too it was so beautiful br br  
Neg, If you have a 1992 Ford Econoline van and bought the vehicle used as I did you will find that the dealer or the factory will not be of any assistance to you if you find that the paint on the horizontal surfaces is falling off  I purchased the vehicle in 1994 and within a year the paint started to delaminate from the body and even though there was a  secret recall   This is a factory related defect confirmed by internal service bulletin  93 8 4   quot Microchecking quot  sent to dealers in April 1993 and covered under your  quot Owner Dialog quot  program  to date nothing has been resolved  I have written numerous letters to no avail  All I can say is if you are looking at Ford products  caveat emptor     
Neg, As I was driving off the lot in my 2002 Ford Explorer  I thought for what I just paid  nothing could be better  I loved everything about it  and drove it everywhere just to be driving it  A few days later  I drove to meet my family  and saw another 2002 Explorer parked in the yard  turns out my sister had just bought her one  and we will get to hers later  First let me explain that I drive 1 hour to work  and then 1 hour back  When I want to go shopping or to the movies  that is another hour  So I put a lot of miles on my car  THE GOOD This car has awesome bright lights  comfortable seats  easy access  and I love the two power outlets  Great for a crowd with cell phones  THE BAD Not long after I got it  the sprayer on the back window didnt work  and soon after that the back window wouldnt stay open  One day  as I was pulling out into traffic  the transmission slipped  and I was nearly hit my oncoming traffic  and that lasted for about 2 months  Oh yea  it probably took about three days when the plastic around the seat broke  At one time  when my friend was in the back  we had the biggest laugh because she couldnt get out because the door was stuck  I didnt think it was too funny  since it has done that since  you just have to shove your body up against it to get it open  Just the other day  when I would try to put the car in park  it would stop between the R and P  You have to take it down and then shove it back up  not problem once you get used to it  Even though  I never used the luggage rack  the paint came off of it  and still ford is being VERY slow about replacing it NOW THE SISTER S EXPLORER When she drove hers  she loved it too  Funny thing is  she loved it until about three weeks ago  when She  Her Husband  her daughter  and me  and my two kids  We had driven up to San Antonio in two cars  and were coming back in one  Her Explorer didn t have the third seat  so that left us with one person without a seat  As we were leaving San Antonio  there is a red light on the bottom of a hill  and as we were coming over the hill  we had to slam on the brakes and swerve to miss a car  Well twice the Explorer went on two wheels  and just as he almost got it under control  we slammed into a rock wall  and them spun around in an ending position of the back of the Explorer against the rock wall  Everyone in the front seat was ok  just sore from the airbags  everyone in the back seat was ok  except for the 8 in cut from the center consol  and the seat belt marks  and for me  the idiot who rode in the back of the car  with no seat  was thrown from the back glass  and surprisingly  ok  The Explorer held up  but was impossible to control  which given the facts that he just slammed on the breaks and got over  not really jerking that hard  the car was not safe My Recommendation is to not buy the Explorer  unless you are a gambling person UPDATE  Now the back left window doesnt roll down  AND I am over warranty  AND the plastic on the back glass is cracking  AND when I drive through holes   there is this horrible sweaking noise  
Neg, I purchased my 1990 Ford Taurus GL Wagon in 1990  So far  I have spent approximately  8 000 on repairs  The main problem with this car is the automatic transmission  it suddenly broke down and had to be rebuilt for the car to be drivable  and that repair cost me around  1 200  There have also been a few recalls on the Taurus  In my opinion  this automobile wasn t built right in the first place  so wether you like it or not  there s going to be a big repair bill about every 3 5 months On the other hand  this is a very strong car  I used it to haul all of my belongings and furniture when I moved from my 2 bedroom apartment into my new house  This car is as strong as an ox  but unfortunately it s not very reliable  If my Taurus didn t break down every once in a while  I would  with no doubt  keep this car for a good twenty years br br  
Neg, I bought this as a car to fix up and play with  It is a 1974 four door  I love the power the 26 year old motor 400M   2V  has  Tire smoke out of your Grandmas grocery getter  I hate the damn AM radio but that will be fixed shortly with a cd player two subs and 8 midbass and treble speakers  stereo is another hobby  I hate that it is so looooooooooong  It rides real smooth even though it is 26 years old  It only has 94 000 miles though  If you are looking for a car to play with or are looking for a drivetrain combination  this full size is the way to go  It looks good with a 2 inch drop  flowmasters  Cragar S S s and fat firehawks  especially with Bright yellow paint with a black top and black pinstripes br br  
Neg, I bought a 1995 F 150 in late 1994  I also sold it in early 1995  Here are the reasons why I drove the truck off the lot in November of 1994  I liked the way the F 150 looked  I thought it looked pretty tough  I also heard a few good things about them from my friends  I didn t exactly baby this truck  but I didn t drive it too hard  I maintained it well  I never beat it to the point where it might break  One day  as I knew inside it would it broke  only 2 months after I got it  I was driving through the snow  about a foot or so of it  and I put the truck in four wheel drive  I noticed right away that something was wrong  It was pulling hard to the left and was very hard to steer  I brought it right back to the Ford dealer and they said I needed new hubs  That was the first thing that broke  In addition to that  the speedometer broke  most of the levers inside  including my seat levers  window roll down levers  and many others  began to just crack like twigs  I then realized this truck was made with very little craftsmanship  like any other Ford I ever owned The F 150 also lacked the power I wanted in a full size pick up  It didn t get up and go like my old Chevys used to  Being very disappointed with this truck I sold it right after winter and bought myself a 1995 Chevy pick up  I was much more satisfied with that then I ever was with my Ford br br  
Neg, I bought this vehicle last year because I wanted a professional looking vehicle that I could drive to a construction site  I am an architect  I found this Explorer and thought that this vehicle would be perfect for work and recreation  I definitely thought this was a good looking vehicle  black with dark tinted windows  power windows and locks and the smoothest  most luxurious ride out of the other trucks I have owned  and I have owned quite a few  Things started to go wrong when I learned about the recalls  The truck was recalled for a hood latch  cruise control problems  and then the tires  I was fortunate in that I did not have the recalled Firestone tires  I wanted bigger tires than the ones that came standard with the truck and paid extra for them  I consider myself lucky on that note  As soon as the warranty went out on the truck I started to have more problems  The truck would shake when it was running and I took it in to have it serviced  I paid roughly  600 for exhaust manifold gasket problems  I got it back and as I was leaving the service station  I went to turn the alarm back on from valet mode and the button fell off into the dashboard  Four days later my wife gets stranded at a meeting because the truck would start and stall when she released the gas  Not only was she stranded  but she was angry and embarrassed as well  She was going to lunch with friends and had to be rescued  She doesn t understand why her 5 year old Jeep which has 160 000 miles has never left her stranded and an almost brand new truck with less than one quarter of the mileage has left us stranded three times  The truck was returned for a third time and another  200 later I drove it out of the service station  Thirty minutes later I was stranded again  The truck wouldn t start and it had to be towed  This is where I am now  I HAVE A TRUCK PAYMENT  NO TRUCK  ALMOST  1 000 IN BILLS AND I STILL DON T KNOW WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY TRUCK OR HOW MUCH IT WILL COST TO FIX IT  I have a brake light that doesn t work  an alarm button that is inside the dashboard and the rear windshield wiper doesn t work as well  All for the small price of  35 000  Where else can you get service like that  but FORD     
Neg, I must say when my cousin pulled up in her new stang convertible I was impressed at first sight and then I came to a quick realization  she d been taken for a ride  She bought the car wanting something that would be an attention grabber  Well  I must say that the most attention that the car has received has been from the mechanic at the Ford dealership  In the first weeks of owing the car the odometer stopped working  which is not a big problem but still lead her to a day without a car  Then the anti theft light started to come on for no reason  along with the airbag light which made no sense  The biggest problem remains  the oil light  if you park the car on a hill the light comes on  A week or two ago the intake manifold cracked with left her with a big towing bill and another week and a half without a car  It also lacks in power that one would expect from a V8  When you ride in the car you can here the top rattling whenever you hit the slightest bump  The overall ride is not smooth at all  With the upkeep expenses and the gas guzzler quality that these cars possess I would not recommend this to anyone unless you don t mind spending all of your time in a rental car br br  
Neg, I bought a 961 2 red mustang convertible  the car of my dreams  Of course I go for looks and not practicality  I did not research the car fully and I wish I did now  Where do I begin  To start after the first week of use I had to get the radiator fixed  I got a flat tire and the power steering was messed up  I have had various tune ups over the two years that I have had it  Recently  all of the oxygen sensors went at the same time  And my trip mileage counter and odometer are busted  They do not accurately measure the mileage  For example  a 80 mile round trip turned into a 5 mile excursion  I drove for 3 hours total and all it measured was 5 miles  And of course  my service rep thinks I am crazy  especially since I am a young woman  And  he tells me that to fix this problem will cost me alot  since it not covered by my warrenty  On top of this  I have leak from the engine  of what I do not know  and a leak when it rains from the top  I recently drove my car in a blizzard in Upstate NY  I can t tell you what a miserable experience I had  If you want a fun looking car then the Mustang is the way to go  but if you are looking for a practical car that is reliable I wouldn t suggest it     
Neg, I had and lemon lawed a 1996 Mustang GT Convertible  Cute car   extremely good looking  Driving it was awful  Front end shook  brakes wouldn t stop  Ford did not stand behind their product and  instead  implied it was all in my head  Yet they had no answer as to why the brakes failed while I was driving it  They couldn t answer why 3 different dealerships refused to do anything about my complaints  They never checked the brakes further then to look at them  They never tested the lines or anything else  They insisted my front end problems were tire related  yet I had 3 different sets of tires on the car in the space of 2 years   the final set had about 9 000 miles and were practically bald down from 19 000 on the first set  which still is less then Goodyear s 25 000 suggested mileage and I drive my cars baby like I do not beat on them or do anything such as that that would wear tires down prematurely  I had 2 Trans Ams prior to that Mustang GT and guess what I got after I won the lemon law case and Ford had to buy back the car  You guessed it   another Pontiac Trans Am  We won t even mention the fact that the Mustang GT doesn t come anywhere close to the T A and Z28 in horsepower  I could get the same horsepower in a 6 cylinder 4 door car  i e  the 300M  that Ford is offering in their supposed  quot sports car quot    I consider the Mustang GT to be a sick joke  Every time I was at Ford there were NUMEROUS Mustangs being brought in for repair   too many to make it worthwhile br br  
Neg, My first car for college is likely to be the last Ford I will ever own  Driving the Ford Tempo is like being behind the wheel of a death wish  By the time I had gotten rid of the vehicle I had experienced all of the following Replaced a CV Joint Lost my Gas gauge and Odometer  well it was still there just dead All interior lights malfunctioned Blinker arm fell off Driver side door failed to open from the inside Driver side Seat back went into a state of constant recline Had scalding hot water dumped from the heating coil onto my foot   I ve never taken a shoe off going down the hi way 70MPH so quickly in all my life Lost A C Lost Heater Lost Defrost  in a snow storm I might add Lost the Muffler The Tie Rod snapped on a curve at 50MPH causing the wheels to be perpendicular to one another consequently ripping the tire off of the wheel near death experience  I could have reached out the window as I was flying through the air and written my name on the near by telephone pole  before I landed in some farmers field Ball Joint snapped  looked like the wheel had decided to take nap  This was repaired for free the mechanic said after 6 repairs your 7th is free  Radiator Problems Don t buy this vehicle  I repeat Don t buy this vehicle  Don t take a free Tempo  After repairs its extremely expensive  I d call it a million dollar car br br  
Neg, I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic  interior  power  warranty  options  etc  points of view  I believe an important  but always neglected area  though is from an undercar point of view  and let me tell you  most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed about the running gear  There are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there  but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my opinion  and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision  If a decision is being made between one of a few different vehicles  I hope to help you decide based on my experience  which one will be better for you from the standpoint of strength of  and reliability of  one of the most important parts of the vehicle as a whole  the steering and suspension system  The Ford Tempo was for years  one of the most popular cars on the market  It sold very well  and there were Tempo s everywhere  Suddenly Tempo s weren t all that hot an item any more  There are many good explanations for this  and one of those I will let you in on right now  The suspensions on the Tempo were exactly the same as was on the Ford Escort  absolute junk  Having the constitution of the United States on my side is a very good thing  because there is not one redeeming quality about the suspension of the Tempo  and if they could the Ford Motor Company and it s engineers would sue me for telling you this  First off nothing is greasable on the Tempo  and the tie rods  both inner and outer wear out at a rapid rate  as do the lower ball joints  The design of the suspension is such that there is quite an angle from where the inner tie rods screw onto the steering rack  down to the steering knuckle  and this angle dictates that there will be a small contact area where the ball on the rack end of the inner tie rod contacts the bearing surface  The smaller the area the faster it will wear  that s just basic physics  And that is exactly what happens  If the engineers designed it where the inner tie rods were more horizontally mounted  there would be more surface area contacted and it would not wear as rapidly  But now it s too late  they are committed to mass production  Even when you replace the factory unit with an after market part  the name s still the same  rapid wear  The lower ball joints are another sore spot  Not greasable and prone to rapid wear  The ball joints on this car are integrated into the complete control arm  so when the ball joint portion wears you have to replace the complete lower control arm  This includes both the bushing on the strut rod  and the inner pivot bushing  This could really be a good thing though  because you will get new bushings when you replace the ball joint  but if you don t need bushings you have no choice  and at over 125 00 each retail  it is an expensive repair to replace both sides  There are many problems with other portions of the suspension on the Tempo too  like strut mounts and bearings  but suffice it to say I am not at all recommending any of you to consider a used Tempo  it just isn t worth it  Even if you got one really cheap  and got all of the front end parts replaced with lifetime warranty after market parts  they will wear out due to extreme angles of operation  And even though the parts would be covered with proof of purchase  and receipt from the garage you got it done at  the labor would have to be covered by you and the hassle of another trip to the garage and being without your vehicle is enough to shy you away from one br br  
Neg, I have now had the displeasure of owning two of these  quot vehicles quot  The first was my first car ever  then when someone ran a stop sign and hit me  totaling that one  my parents bought me another one  I ll say this  that was all the motivation I needed to save up the money on my own and by my OWN car The worst part about the Tempo was that I had the same problems with both of them  The oil leaks  the muffler rusting out completely  the shocks rotting out  I even talked to a ford tech to ask him what would be causing my car to smoke and smell bad if it wasn t over heating  As soon as I told him it was a tempo  he diagnosed it as an oil leak  And then he asked me if my Muffler had fallen off yet  it hadn t at the time but did less than a month later  That oil leak  a week after it started smoking  and on the day I had bought the part to fix it  CAUGHT ON FIRE  That s right  my car caught on fire in my friend s driveway  Thankfully since we were there to work on the car  we caught it before it did any damage Other various problems I ve had between my two tempos include not starting without recharging the battery when the temperature dipped below 30  which happened with two separate batteries  so it was definitely the car  busted alternator  the seatbelt motor not working  which cost  500 to fix and was required by law  One window s motor not working and being stuck up  two windows getting stuck down  SUCKED in the rain  a radio that didn t shut off with the rest of the car and had to be turned off manually  And  my personal favorite  the electronic fuel door release just stopped working  But that ended up working out for the best because at the time  the door itself had stopped shutting  I beg you not to buy this car  life is too short to make all of the mistakes yourself  sometimes you need to learn from someone else s br br  
Neg, I had a Ford Taurus that was a deathtrap so I went to a Ford dealership to buy a new car  thinking that they d have to take it  I was planning on getting a Ford Escort GT but they only come in stick shifts  So the sales person steered me towards the Tempo  The price was good and it was shiny new so I bought it  I also bought the extended 50k warranty  Before the car hit 25k the fuel pump went  Repaired for free  Then the starter went  Repaired for free  Then it went again  Free  The third time was less then 6 months after  2 and they wanted me to pay a  50 deductible  The boyfriend type man convinced them that they did NOT want to charge me  The next time my car wouldn t start  similar situation to when the starters went  a friend suggested I put the car in neutral and let it roll   and it started  From that point on I was constantly rolling and starting it  Looks stupid when you re not on an incline  Finally the rolling technique stops working and I tell the Ford dealership to put in another starter  They keep it for the day and say there s nothing wrong with it  the starter is  300 and do I really want it  I take it home  and it promptly refuses to start  I take it to the local car repair shop and they diagnose a starter cellanoid and fix it for  29 00  I also asked the Ford dealership to repair the stupid clicking noise the heater fan  which is constantly on  makes  This is  200  and  of course I ve already had this fixed  The Ford guy just shrugs and says  quot oh  these things keep breaking quot  like that means I should just keep paying for it  The car just turned 86k so I m not happy about all of these repeat repairs  since I m the one paying for them now     
Neg, I bought this 1994 Tempo in June of 1995 for vehicle for business purposes  It s the worst vehicle I have every owned   and it s not even fixable  To date no one has been able to diagnose what is wrong with this lemon  I m scared to go anywhere with it  You have to carry a cell phone when you do drive it for when you break down  I drive about 25 km to work and on a hot day  I may not make it to work and won t make it home  During the hot weather  it breaks down about three times a week on my way home  and usually the breakdown point is within the same 2 km area I bought extended warranty which to date has covered very few of the repairs  In fact  they just can t find what is wrong with the car  It quits when it gets hot  just like an old fashioned vapour lock used to   sometimes will restart within ten minutes but sometimes takes a couple of hours  it quits or won t start when the weather is wet  not even right after a tune up  it quits when you go through a puddle and splash water on the lower part of the engine it may or may not start if the weather is cold  and the service engine light hardly ever goes off  The codes are of absolutely no assistance to diagnosing the problems  Last summer it was in for service several times a month  usually on a tow truck  and it is still not fixed The gas mileage is just about the same as my old beater 1988 F150 Supercab 3 4 ton truck  In fact  the last trip from Halifax to Toronto was cheaper driving the truck than the trip 2 months before driving the 1994 Tempo  And the truck made it no problems  the car broke down Christmas Eve in Montreal and then again in Toronto on Boxing Day I buy a vehicle expecting to get at least ten years out of it  My husband has a lot of mechanics tickets for heavy equipment and maintains our vehicles very well  As soon as I finish paying off this lemon this summer  it s going  I still have a year s warranty left on it but I just can t afford the gas  the downtime and repairs that aren t covered Nothing the Ford dealer represented to me on this vehicle is true br br  
Neg, I bought this car thinking it would be a deal  because my friend owns one  and he said it has been great for him  well little did I know how absolutely terrible this car is  it breaks down every 20 miles  gets bad gas mileage  and it has this odor It s awful  I can t turn on the heater  because the element has broken down  the radio hardly works  I can only listen to KOZY 106 5  which is fine  but it gets really annoying  the steering wheel sticks  I have had to call my friends and family so many times to come pick me up from work so many times it s embarrassing  And noone will buy it off of me because unlike me  they are smart and can spy a lemon  I have even left the keys in the car in plain view in high hopes that someone would steal it  but they wouldn t even do that for me  This is seriously the worst car I have EVER had     
Neg, I have owned my 1994 Ford Tempo now since July of 1995 and though Ford is usually a  quot name you can trust quot  it is not in this case  This car has had constant problems with the brakes  which no one can seem to fix  with the engine itself  an oil leak that I swear was there when it left the factory floor  bad locks  bad door handles I could go on and on and on I thought that this would be a reliable family type car  big enough for groceries  yet not so big that it would be hard to handle  Instead I find that this car is so unreliable and shoddily made as far as I am concerned  it should never have been built in the first place  Due to financial trouble  I got roped into paying  52 37 a week FOR FIVE YEARS For this lemon knowing what I know now  I wouldnt give Ford the first MONTH s worth of payments for this money pit br br  
Neg, I bought a used 1987 Ford Tempo GL for my wife  At first  it was a good car  But then  things went wrong  I had to put several hundred dollars into the car in the past 2 years  the air conditioner don t work  I had to replace the computer  and it s still running bad  I guess I should have got the hint when we found all the paperwork on the car and there where several receipts from mechanic work done on the car  And I have seen several Tempo s on the side of the road broke down  I also know that Tempo s have an exhaust leak problem  I ve seen a lot of Tempo s that are very load because the muffler need to be replaced  The car is a nice car  don t get me wrong  but I think there are mechanical problems with it that make this car a bad choice br br  
Neg, This was my first car  unfortunately it s been a huge problem for me  In less than a year  I have already invested at least half it s worth  The first day I drove it over 10 miles it locked up and was unable to drive  My tailpipe and my muffler have fallen off  My mileage has constantly gone done  averaging about 15 miles a gallon  I ve changed the brakes 3 times in less than a year  and they still squeak when I stop  When you are in park  it feels like you are in an earthquake  It rattles  no matter what  The central air is tricky  you have to press off every time you turn off the car or when you turn the air back on it will be on defrost  My right window on the passenger side doesn t even open  The throttle cable hangs up and makes it so sometimes that you can t even make it go over 45 miles an hour unles you re lucky enough to hit that big of a hill  The trunk doesn t open unless you have the car on  The doors stick and you have to repeatedly press unlock to get it to unlock  The scariest thing is that when you drive sometimes the door flies open  No matter where you are  the inter state or a rural road  Even when it s locked  I wouldn t recomend this car  It s too unsafe  Two nice things are the comfy seats   especially when you are waiting for someone  and the roomy trunk  Dependable seekers  look else where br br  
Neg, I bought a 1994 Tempo after my Hyundai XL completely died  It was one of two Tempos on the Ford lot  and the only two cars in my budget range  I was in college and working two part time jobs  I purchased the extended warranty for almost  3000 and never used it  which was stupid because the seatbelt motors went bad after I had the car for a week  so my automatic seatbelts wouldn t work and made loud noises trying to work  I just didn t have the time to go into the dealership because I was in classes and working constantly  Needless to say  they are still broken  and it probably wouldn t have been covered anyway  My extended warranty only covered major body work  It worked fine right up until the point that my extended warranty ran out  Of course  I wasted  3000 and I still have nearly  3000 to pay on the loan on a car that isn t worth  1500  The driver side window has to be manually forced down  and the driver side rear window squeaks when being rolled down  Another con is that the back windows only roll down half way A couple of months ago  the gas tank started leaking  At first  I could smell the gas  and once  my friend witnessed a couple of gallons just pouring out into the gutter  I took it to a repair shop  and they told me that nothing was wrong with the gas tank  but they did find out that my rear right brake needed work  That wasn t a surprise  My brakes had been causing me constant squeaking and grinding problems for over a year  I thought that my brake problems were solved  Yeah right  Previously  I had paid over  400 at Midas to get them fixed  and they ended up worse than when I took them in  I took them back  and they reported that there was absolutely nothing wrong with them  My brakes make constant noise most of the time  but that day  they chose to remain quiet after I took it in  Anyway  I told the repair shop to fix the brake  It cost me over  200  and I couldn t tell that there was a difference when I took it back  Since then  I still have bad brakes  and while I no longer smell gas or witness gas leaking  I get about 10 miles to the gallon  My car has begun to make a rattling noise  and the trunk catch is broken  I have to tie my trunk down  I m a student  and I can t afford a car that causes me constant problems  I ve heard about other Tempo owners who were constantly paying to repair brakes  Shops will tell them that there is nothing wrong with them until the brakes have been damaged so much that the whole system needs to be replaced  There have also been numerous reports about gas tank problems and cars catching on fire because of leaks  I m not repairing anything on this car  I m getting rid of it  The only other good thing about it is that it has a lot of trunk room and plenty of back seat space  Not that I get to use that space  No one wants to ride in my death trap  
Neg, My Family purchased this car after our 1988 Ford Taurus Station Wagon went out  We thought  well  since that was a good car  why don t we try this one  Our mechanic sold it to us  He had used it 5 months  Since that time  a muffler has come out  the transmission has gone out  the door quit working  the windows quit  and other technicalities  Our family has big  tall people  This car is not designed for Big  Tall people  It is for Little people  4 8 5 5  We are getting rid of it  DO NOT GET THIS CAR  WE HAVE SPENT LOTS OF MONEY ON REPAIRS AND YOU WILL TOO br br  
Neg, This car would make a great pic nic table  or maybe a great fountain in the front yard if you gutted it out  This car would be absolutely great  just as long as you weren t driving it  I absolutely hate my Ford Tempo  It was a great car for the first day  and I still think the interior is rather comfortable not roomy by any means  but comfortable  This is a very minimalist car no special features  pretty basic interior  pretty sluggish  etc etc etc  It s only great feature is that it s a cheap car to fix  And fix you will do a lot  This car makes more noises than a synthesizer  unfortunately they don t sound as good  Watch out for the harmonic balancer  This happened to me after the first month  Basically it makes a sound like a jackhammer in the distance  especially when making a turn  Apparently this problem is so common  that when I took it to the shop  the mechanic ran upto my car before I left it and told me I needed to replace my harmonic balancer  Apparently Ford stuck a very cheap one in the tempo that cracks on a regular basis  Ok  back to the car buy a Taurus instead  In fact  if you can  don t buy a Ford  So  to reflect on what I ve just written  this is a bad car  a very very bad car  Don t buy one  you wont be happy  unless you are a really twisted person br br  
Neg, About a year ago I sold my 1990 Ford Ranger STX 4x4  I had good reason to sell it  It was so incredibly unreliable  It was a four wheel drive regular cab short bed  It had a 5 speed manual transmission  2 9L V 6 engine  AM FM cassette  My Ranger was a nice looking off white with tan cloth interior and bucket seats with console  It was a very attractive truck  but constantly needed some kind of repair  Literally every month something went wrong with it  My father had given it to me because he knew I needed a vehicle and he wanted something newer  It wasn t terribly old though  It had about 114 000 miles on it and ran great  My father had the truck since new  and pampered it  Two weeks after he gave it to me  the engine started smoking really bad  I took it in to the local Ford dealer  They said it needed pretty much all new seals and gaskets  A  600 repair  A couple of weeks after that  the A C stopped working  a  400 repair  A month after that  I accidentally pressed the four wheel drive button and it got stuck on  I took it back to the Ford dealer  I was told that there was too much grease on the front hubs and it was causing the four wheel drive to stick  wrong  When I took it in for the third time to get the stupid four wheel drive fixed  I was told that it needed a new 4x4 engage disengage motor  This solved the problem  Within a month of that happening  the clutch started slipping  but didn t bother fixing it because I had already put so much money in to it and couldn t afford the clutch  At about the same time  the speedometer stopped working occasionally  I don t know if poor reliability like this is normal for a truck or not  but I will never buy a truck again  Not to mention that it was rediculously slow on the highway  You could floor the gas pedal without ANY acceleration  It got terrible gas mileage too  I only had it about six months during all of this before I traded it in for a car  Don t consider a truck unless you ABSOLUTELY need one  Trucks tend to be slow accelerating  gas guzzling  and unsafe vehicles compared to cheaper cars     
Neg, We bought this truck back in 1991 from a woman in our community  We got it with less than 80 000 miles on it at the time  Now it has nearly 170 000  Sure  it drinks  and drips  loads of oil and isn t very good on gas milage anymore  but that truck is made like a Timex  Presently it smokes from the wore out muffler and some other place on the engine  I have to ride the breaks when I m at a red light  and it never ever wants to start when it s the least bit cold outside  but my little truck is paid for and it s never let me down  With all of its problems it s never cost over  275 at one time to repair  Mostly it s just replacing of belts and filters  or adjusting the corborater  Since this truck has lasted so long with its problems  I would consider buying another Ford truck in the future  I can t really recommend the new Rangers since I know nothing about Ford s quality now br br  
Neg, I made a big mistake and bought a 1997 Ford Taurus SE  I used to work at a large Ford dealership and thought I still had lots of friends at the dealership  so I went there to buy my car  When I bought the car it had 28 000km on it  I thought the price was a good deal  but let me tell you it was no deal The car has shown well in safety tests  probably because its always in the shop and not on the road  and is quite comfortable and roomy in the front and trunk is large and can hold just about anything  Ford rates it as dependable and reliable  Well the people who rate the dependability and reliability of this model must not own one This car spends more time getting fixed then it does on the road  The dome light stays on whenever it feels like  the heater motor went 6 months after we bought it  the cable that runs form the steering column to the transmission snapped right after the 60 000km warranty ran out  There are power surges when you slow down for lights or stop signs  But the biggest problem is that the car has less than 117 000km and now the transmission has blown  Even though I know a mechanic that charges me less than the going rate for labor  this repair is going to set me back approx  3 000  with the cost of car rental for 10 days  I can say however that the car rides nice and smooth and the steering so far has been good  it corners well and does not shake and shimmy at speeds of 100km or more  This vehicle gets good gas mileage and does not burn a lot of oil However the bad out weighs the good  For a domestic car the repair bills are quite costly and the parts are not as easy to get as you would think  With the time is spends in the shop and the cost to repair  it just is not worth it When I spoke with the dealership one of the sales guys laughed at me and said that the Taurus is just not a good car  thanks for selling it to me Not only that but the place that my mechanic sent the transmission said that he already has 4 Taurus s 97 and newer that have the same problem Unless you like to spend a lot of money and love to read the magazines and check out the guys at the shop I don t recommend this car to anyone  I know that I will be unloading mine as fast as possible What the say about FORD  found on road dead or fix or repair daily  definitely applies to this model br br  
Neg, UPDATE  After this epinion was posted  the car  having about 55 000 miles on it  had the transmission go out of it  The trans would refuse to go into gear  The cost of the repairs were estimated at 2500  I do also know for a fact  that a close friend of mine who was a ford fan  had also had a 97 taurus  and his transmission went out at about 65 000 miles  Apparently  according to the dealership  ford knows that this is a problem  but will not really do anything to help their customers  I definetally cannot reccomend anyone buying this kind of car original epinion While thankfully  i did not buy the taurus  i still must drive it  My fiancee has this car as her company car  it being a 97 model  while the 3 0 L V6 has some pep  the rest of the car is all down hill from there  The exterior of the car is like the title said  a Fish car  Altho for 2000 Ford realized their blunder  and tried to remedy the situation  The round rear window and the low trunk looks very strange to me  the taurus s sister  the sable looks a bit better from the front  using some chrome accents  Inside  there are a host of things that annoy both of us  First off is Ford s attempt at stationary lumbar support  When you sit in either of the front seats  your upper torso  namely your shoulders are pushed forward in an awkward position  not comfortable at all  The power lumbar in an upper model may fix this  Secondly  The  control pod  with the radio and climate controls is not well designed  First  the buttons are all similar  and close together  somewhat so making it hard to distinguish radio controls from climate controls  The 3rd thing  is that there is no good place for a portable CD player to sit  My first choice would be an aftermarket stereo  but it s a company car  and the control pod limits the modifications that can be done to the stereo  So  we use the portable CD player in the car  In order to have a place to put the CD player  the armrest must be in the folded out position  which requires the use of a corded Y adaptor for ciggaret lighter power  because the armest when open  will not allow the ashtray to be open  Aside from these things  the taurus is a rather safe car  But  if it were my money  i think that i could find a better suited car for the money that it is worth 
Neg, When we bought this car we did not want to spend a lot of money  Ours was the last of its kind on the lot  it s a  97 G  but we bought it new in  98  It s stripped down  it has an AM FM stereo and power windows  but no power locks or trunk release from inside the vehicle   a definite negative  Still  these issues were minor because we wanted a car with a good safety rating  and we needed a car that was relatively inexpensive  This car was both We felt we were OK because it was new and came with the manufacturer s warranty 3 year  36 000 bumper to bumper  We used the car primarily for cross country trips and it did quite well  But on our third trip  we noticed the transmission was very tough to shift into gear  We had 8 000 miles on the car  The dealer found that the transmission had a problem  and only fixed the portion that was causing the problem  Some seals were bad  as well as some valves  I asked why they wouldn t replace the entire transmission  considering it failed after only 8 000 miles  He said they only repair the portions that failed  In my opinion  I have a defective transmission which is begging to fail and strand me  or my wife and kids  in the middle of nowhere  Ford was not willing to replace the transmission  Despite this major flaw  the transmission is still not working perfectly and the warranty has expired  the car has been fairly reliable  During the three years we ve owned it  we ve barely put 35 000 miles on it  All of the repairs done were covered by the warranty  see below  I won t say it was  free  however  because each time I took the car in for repairs  they kept the car all day and I had to make other arrangements to get to work  1  transmission   pseudo repaired   it works  but not perfectly 2  power steering pump   noisy and replaced 3  emissions switch   a light came on in the dash informing us to check the engine  had to go to a dealer  we were on vacation  and spent the morning there while the switch was replaced 4  weather stripping on passenger front door   seal was broken between the door and the car body   replaced 
Neg, Since 1997  when I bought my 97  Ford Taurus  I have gotten to know my auto repair man very well  I have spent more time waiting in his shop in the past few years than I have going out with my husband  This car not only has given me a ton of trouble  but it s always strange odd trouble  Car troubles that no one has ever heard about  Last year I had to replace the engine because I drove through a puddle  That s right  the engine  Sometimes when I step on the brakes the rear defrost goes on  Of course this is just the mild trouble other problems I ve had  include the interior lights never going out  causing the battery to die  Sometimes the alarm goes off  while I m driving  I truly believe I could make a horror movie comparable to the Amityville Horror house move about this car  My point is  save yourself trouble and hassle and RUN don t walk away from that Ford Dealership br br  
Neg, Ford taurus  have to be the worse car on the road today mechanically  sure  it looked good  but not worth all the money you need to sink in to it to keep it running  I put a total of 4 transmissions in mine and even that one was on it way out when i traded it in  There are also 2 safety issues i have with this car  first one is the engine mounts fell off  yes  my engine flew to the ground just about  they did recallit butnot until after ipaid that expense  The second and more serious flaw is that on a 90 degree turn into oncoming traffic  the turn signal switch that is inside the steering column broke off inside causing me to loose control of all steering  They still have not recalled this even though i know many people this happened to and they called it in also  I would never purchase a ford taurus again  heck  i wouldnt even take one for free unless i owned a money tree br br  
Neg, I will NEVER buy a Ford vehicle again  I bought my 2 year old Taurus from a reputable Ford dealer  They told us that the car was just off of a lease  It had never been in an accident  the brakes were new and we still would have one year left on the original warranty  We bought it the car and the story  The brakes had to be totally redone after just two months  The Ford reason for the rust and corrosion was the car had  quot stood quot  too long  Yeah on their LOT  Then there s the TRANSMISSION  First it was a hard shift on my automatic transmission  They adjusted the computer  Then it needed still more adjustment  This dealer couldn t fit us in for 4 weeks  So we tried another Ford dealer  They wouldn t touch a car that another Ford dealer had already touched  We called FORD s 800 number  They said the second dealer had to take us  The dealer then said they were too busy to get us in  We called the original dealer and asked for a loaner as we didn t want to damage the transmission  They refused and said we weren t damaging the car  When they did finally see our car they said we needed a whole new transmission  They then said that the warranty had run out and besides it must have been something we did  We ve since learned that Ford Taurus has a history of transmission problems and obviously don t back their product  NEVER EVER AGAIN br br  
Neg, In early 1998 I purchased a 1997 Ford Taurus SHO program car from my local dealer  The car had been purchased and used by Ford as a  quot Junior Executive quot  automobile  whatever that means  The vehicle itself was in great shape with only 15K miles on it  so my wife and I figured  quot Hey  it s practically new quot  The car was back into the shop within the first two weeks to have the  quot Football quot  replaced  The tape deck unit was not functioning properly  so the entire radio climate control unit had to be replaced  Within a month  the car had 16K miles on it at this point  I had to take it back to the dealer to have the drivers side rear window motor replaced  It seemed a bit early to have this motor replaced  but it was under warranty so I didn t complain too much  Things seemed to go fine for about three weeks  when the CD changer wouldn t register that there were any CDs and wouldn t release the CD cartridge  This problem took about 7 visits  3 different CD units and the course of six months to finally get straighten  In the mean time  while visiting family in Iowa at Christmas time  I accidentally pressed the sunroof  quot Tilt quot  button while looking for the map light  in the dark of course  The sunroof then refused to close  It took about 25 minutes of me standing in 4 inches of snow  and my wife trying from the inside to get the sunroof closed   to this day  the sunroof still doesn t close everytime you press the close button  Upon our return  we once again took the car to the dealer for warranty repairs  A few months passed with no further problems from the car  everything seemed to work properly  One afternoon while leaving on another trip to Charlotte  about 3 hours I took the car through one of these gas station car washes  when the sunroof leaked water on my wife  Upon further inspection  we found that  while being closed flush on the drivers side  the passenger side of the sunroof failed to close the entire way  leaving about an 1 8 quot  gap  I stopped by the dealer  set up an appointment and we proceeded on our way  When we arrived in Charlotte  We checked into our hotel and decided to grab a bite to eat before the concert  We drove maybe fifteen minutes from the hotel to a cafe  We spent about another 15 20 minutes eating  When I got back out to the car after eating  it was dead  Nothing  Nada  When I turned the ignition key  abosolutely nothing happened  The car didn t sound like it had a low battery  it didn t make any sound  I had to wait for about and hour and a quater for a tow truck to come  then had to wait another hour while the local dealer supplied me with a rental car  it was a Ford operated rental agency too  I was further informed that FORD expected me to cover the costs of the rental  and that my car might not be ready the next day  since it was 5pm and that I would be charged to take the rental out of state  and then they expected me to return to Charlotte to retreive my car  I was floored at the apathy of Ford  especially when my service records showed the unacceptable number of time that the vehicle had been in the shop for warranty repairs  over 12 times in 12 months  I bit my tongue and rented a car  Crown Vic  60 a day  Luckily my car was ready the next morning  prognosis  the battery had gone dead  I don t see how  when it happened out of the blue  I had had NO problems starting the car at the hotel  and then 45 minutes later  15 of the driving and recharging the battery  and nothing pulling power fromt he battery when the car was turned off  the battery is all of the sudden dead  with no charge  It was at this point that I starting telephoning Ford Customer Service  who most of the time were rude and told me they had no further interest in me or my vehicle problems  After 9 phone calls and 6 months of complaining  a call to a lawyer  and hassling with the local dealer  who all they wanted to do was trade in this car and sell me another one  Ford finally gave me a 75K mile warranty on my car  It took long enough for Ford to show any signs of customer service  I was very diasappointed in the way that Ford handled the situation  I expect that cars have some problems  but it seemd to me that 12 times for warranty repair in 12 months on a car with less that 30K miles was a bit unacceptable  So far  knock on wood  the car hasn t been in for anything other than routine maitenance  oil  brakes  etc in about 10 months or so  Maybe the problems have worked themselves out  I cannot recommend the SHO version of this car to anyone who doesn t have the time or patience to deal with a car that is constantly in the shop br br  
Neg, Could things get any worse I loved how it looked  after that it was all down hill  Besides the neat oval theme there is nothing about this car I liked  First problem was a short in the steering column  ever time you turn right the radio would shut off  Then as I drove home from a long vacation  at night  made a right hand turn and the headlights shorted out   We ended up sleeping at a rest stop until the sun came up and comfort is not included with the oval theme  Then I had problems with the tranny slipping and when you put it in reverse none of the electrical worked  And to think this all happened before I could make my first loan payment br br  
Neg, We bought our 1997 Ford Taurus used in 1998  It had 10 000 miles on it and was the GL edition  Unfortunately we were looking forward to getting another Crown Victoria but none were in our price range  As a whole the car performs well  It started everytime you wanted it to and did great in the snow  While driving around in suburban areas the car is a dream  it s a smooth ride  quite quiet  and the car itself has no trouble  However once you hit try to go on the highway things get a bit shakey  In the beginning It seemed hard to get the car to cruising speed  Once at cruising speed things cool down a bit  but try to accelerate from cruising speed and the car will give out quite a shudder  This isn t the best car to be taking on long highway trips  Other than that the car will perform well  Next there is the interior  All the radio  A C and heating controls are in one area which makes it very easy to memorize  The dashboard is arranged in an orderly fashion  The seats are very comfortable although the drives seat could have more lumbar support  As a whole the interior is very roomy  There is enough room for me being 6 feet to sit in the front and my friend of the same height to sit in the back without us having our knees at our ears  Unfortunately much of the interiors moving parts were made of plastic which broke of when over used  As a whole this car was ok  I never got used to how many miles to the gallon you could get in the Taurus and the stuff you could fit in it  Although towards 70k miles this car started needing expensive repairs it lived through a trip to Washington DC and my Mother who runs child day care in our house and used it many times to transport them  For this cars performance i wish we had gotten another Crown Victoria we still our 1988 one which has 147 000 miles and still out performs the Taurus 
Neg, I bought my 1997 Taurus LX from Tom Wood Ford in Indianapolis in April of 1998  It was a demo and had 6 000 miles on it  Listing for  28 700  I paid  21 000 for it  I asked the dealer twice to provide an owner s manual  none was ever provided so I switched dealers to Capital City Ford  I have had the Taurus in the shop MANY times for non routine items  including  The cigarette plug broke  the overdrive switch broke  a component in the steering linkage failed  and the stereo is garbage  Let me tell you about the  700 mach 460 radio Ford is so proud of  It has intermittent static in the front speakers  and I have taken it to Capital City Ford FIVE times to be repaired  The static is still there  The service department will not replace the stereo because they are afraid Ford will charge them for the item if it tests OK at Ford  In the meantime  both Ford and Capital City have ensured that my wife s next car will be a Daimler Chrysler  In fairness  I have a Ford Ranger that is flawless  but my Taurus is a piece of junk  I called Ford to have them tell the dealership to fix the problem  and they gave me the runaround  Goodbye Ford  hello Chrysler 300M     
Neg, I honestly can t complain about the engine or transmission or any other major component of my 1997 Taurus GL  It has always gotten me where I need to go and has always started up in the morning  etc  However  about 2 000 miles after my 36 000 mile warranty expired  all sorts of things started to go awry  First  the passenger side window  automatic  of course  stopped rolling down  The driver s side went soon after that  And  now  none of my windows roll down  When you get into the car  the little light showing that a door is ajar remains on along with the dome light and all other interior lights  It s quite embarrassing driving down the highway at night with your car lit up like Times Square The parts  from what we have discovered  are only available through Ford  which means big money  So  my husband messed with it until he got a couple of the windows working  I m still waiting for the dome light to go out or the battery to run down first  I m anxious to trade this baby in before anything else happens br br  
Neg,  The 1992 Ford Taurus  was now in its 2nd generation  many car companies for 1992 had revised their sedans to look more aerodynamic  so Ford had to do something to stay on top in the style department  Unfortunately this attempt resulted in a more blase look  The 1992 Ford Taurus  while improved in some areas  never made it past 1st base in other areas   The 1992 Ford Taurus  is not much different than the 1991 models  the 2 4 liter  90 horse powered engine is finally dropped  but there still is an anemic 140 horsepower 3 0 Vulcan V6 as its base engine  The 1992 also weighs more than its predecessor  tipping the scales for the first time over 3 100lbs  The next engine is the Essex 3 8 engine  It too has 140 horsepower  but unlike the Vulcan 3 0 it gets all its power at a much lower RPM  and has more torque  215lb ft  The top of the line engine is the 3 0 DOHC engine that was built partly by Ford  and mostly by Yamaha in Japan  This engine cranks out an impressive 220 horsepower  and will burn rubber if you don t watch your right foot at a stop light  This engine unfortunately is only available in the top of the line  SHO  models  and they only come with a 5 speed manual for this year  The AXOD transmission still  after thousands of complaints  comes in the GL and LX models with the OHV 3 0 and 3 8 engine  Ford obviously did not listen to their customers very well i Driving Impressions i   T he LX equipped with the 3 0 is what most of the critics called  anemic   boring  and just  plain sad  this lack of power problem was obviously an issue that I did not share alone  This car not only was slow in the lightweight models of the mid 1980s  but for 1992 it s even slower with the added weight and no increase in engine power  The 1992 Ford Taurus  of course is not a race car  however shouldn t  acceleration  onto the freeway at a decent pace be a standard amenity in an almost  20 000 family car  I think so  Remember  when these cars were new they were not exactly cheap  some LX models were as much as  21 000  a good engine  with adequate power is not asking too much  is it  My Test car  a 1992 LX only had 82 000 miles on it  but felt like it had much more  There were tears in the headliner and vanity mirrors  the carpet was worn  the back seat had tears in the cheap leather  This car looked as though it had been through the war  There was even a time while accelerating up hill that the transmission totally slipped out of gear  I had to shift to neutral then back to D  After letting off of the gas pedal  the transmission let itself go back into high gear  and I resumed my way up the hill at around 45 MPH on the freeway  very dangerous when the speed limit is 80  but I had no choice i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  is not too bad  I ve never personally been in a 92 Taurus when it was brand new  lets see  in 1992 I was around 14 years old  But I can imagine what this car probably looked like  The leather probably looked plush  the headliner fitted like a nice pair of leather pants  and the transmission as silky smooth as my skin  that s me trying to be funny  Anyway enough about probably s  this car is now 10 years old and it is pretty darn close to what many would consider junk  The interior does boast tons of room  trunk room included  There is 6 way power seats with lumbar support as an option for the LX  leather  a cold AC  an optional electronic dash  electric antenna  5 MPH bumpers  front air bags  finally  ABS is an option  The 6 speaker Ford sound system probably would have been good  but it didn t work so I can t comment   Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior  looks much like the 1st generation s  The rear looks a little more square  there is modified tail lights and head lights  body colored bumpers and door handles  more attractive stock rims  and paint has been revised so it doesn t wash off as easy as the previous 1st generation models  When I say  wash off  in a number of cases this actually happened with first generation Ford Taurus i Price i  The  price  for a 1992 LX Taurus will cost you around 3 000 dollars  In many cases these cars are being given away  or close to it   Other Cars To Consider b i 1  Dodge Intreped 2  Eagle Vision 3  Chevrolet Lumina  a href content 63653777028 http www epinions com content 63653777028 a   My Review 4  Honda Accord 5  Toyota Camry 6  Chevrolet Corsica 7  Plymouth Acclaim 8  Dodge Dynasty 9  BMW 3 series 10  Ford Thunderbird  Happy Car Shopping  
Neg, My 1992 Ford Taurus has 85 000 miles on it and is ready for the junk heap  It is just not a well built car  I purchased it in 1995 for  5 500  and at the time it had only 15 000 miles on it  no the odometer had not been turned back  Since then I have put untold amounts of money into this lemon and it is  nevertheless  on its last legs The radiator has been replaced twice as have the cooling fan and hoses  The brakes have been replaced twice in there entirety because Ford brakes do not have the tell tale squeal feature to inform one that the pads are becoming thin  Thus  you find out they are bad when you start to hear metal grinding at which time you realize you are about to owe an extra  200  Just this year I blew both heads on the engine  needed a new battery  new engine mount  new sway bars  new struts  for the second time  new battery cables  new calipers  another new coolant fan  had to have my electric window fixed on driver s side when it froze and my transmission is shot but I haven t taken care of that yet  The only thing on this car that has been reliable is the body which has not rusted at all  and I live in NY with harsh winters and salt on the road  Why do I still own this car  Well I am lazy  I don t know about you but shopping for a new car is something I look forward to with the same zeal as root canal  It also is a process that requires many hours of time which I frankly do not have Now you may be thinking that with all this repair I must have been very hard on the car  Actually no  I garage the car usually  have relatively frequent oil changes and tune ups  and I don t drive like a maniac  The car is either built poorly  or has gremlins The 1992 Ford Taurus has sluggish pep  and corners like a rhinoceros  There is also an annoying momentary hesitation when the gas pedal is pushed down  The brakes work fine between fixings and the car does have relatively ample trunk space  but the Ford s cupholder is located directly below the radio so it is very hard to drink anything and change stations  Also  the cupholder is incredibly poorly made  It has a thin hinged bar underneath that looks something like a  quot U quot  When you hit a bump that U sways forward  If you hit a few bumps it sways enough that it comes out from beneath the cup bottle and you have drink all over your legs  floor  seat and  in my case  my passport which is now partially stained purple and redolent of grape soda  Another thing I find annoying  this is really a tangent as most cars have this feature  is that when you touch the electric window button the windows rolls down all the way automatically  Whoever thought this up must not ever crack their windows which is the preferred degree I want them open  So what are the advantages of owning this car  Well  as I m sure you are all aware  the Ford Taurus is one of the sleekest cars on the road with its sexy boxiness and sultry lack of curves  I find women often turn there head as I drive by  whistle and say  quot nice Taurus quot   lt Yeah right  There are no advantages to having this car that I can discern I would say  all in all  stay far  far away from this automobile br br  
Neg, I purchased my 92 Ford Taurus in 1999 based on my loan officer s opinion of what size loan I could handle  Obviously  he didn t figure the maintenance costs into that estimate  In less than twenty four hours  literally  I found myself stranded on the side of a major highway  screeching into a pay phone that  yes  they most certainly would send a tow truck  The water pump was shot Over the next seven months I got to know my mechanic very well  The transmission nearly fell out from under the car  and did manage to crack the planetary   planetary what I haven t a clue  but it cost  1500 to replace  Soon after I also replaced the heater coil  window motor  and the air conditioner   twice  in southern Mississippi you have to have the AC  I hitched a ride to the mechanic so many times that I honestly can t remember every thing that had to be fixed or replaced During the last month of my ownership the transmission began slipping  again  and the wiring went completely nuts  I honestly don t know a single person who has purchased a used Taurus  of any year  that didn t have major problems with the car  The car is very comfortable  and a dream to ride in  but you can never assume that you reach your destination  They re just not built to survive more than a few years br br  
Neg, I purchased my Eddie Bauer Expedition three months ago  I compared the Tahoe and Expedition head to head before making my decision  I hate to be a stick in the mud as everyone at Epinions that has rated their Expedition seems to really love them  but I personally think I may have blundered in not buying a Tahoe What initially sold me on the Expedition was the overall cost  My Expedition was about  2000 less than a comparable equipped Tahoe LT  and I purchased it at a time when Ford was offering a great APR on all Expeditions  I secured a loan for 2 9  over 60 months  compared to GM s 7 9  The Ford had more  gadgets  and my kids went nuts over the entertainment system with the flip down TV that came as a free option from Ford on my particular model My Expedition has the 4 6 V 8  I chose the 4 6 over the 5 4 for better fuel economy  or so I thought  The window sticker stated that my vehicle should get 16 City  and 21 Highway  This couldn t be any further from the truth  With numbers like 16   21  I should average about 18 19 MPG overall  right  I average 13 1 MPG  Thinking at first that the problem may be my driving  for a period I drove speed limits only  and attempted to monitor my take off s and such  and my mileage only improved by 1 MPG  This is my main beef with this vehicle  Either I purchased a lemon  or Ford is inappropriately labeling these vehicles  I d like to hear from other Expedition owners to see if their Expedition s had similar gas mileage claims One of my close friends purchased a Chevy Tahoe with a 5 3 V 8  He claims that he is averaging about 18 MPG  I drove a Tahoe with this engine  and it is a powerhouse  Even GM s smaller 4 8 seemed to have a lot more power than Ford s 4 8 If you absolutely love the Expedition and don t care about gas mileage  buy the 5 4 engine  It will get virtually the same mileage as the underpowered 4 6  and will make driving much more pleasurable  P S  If you do purchase an Expedition or if you already own one  think about replacing your factory shocks with a pair of Bilstein Shocks  I did  and they made it handle 100  better  reducing it s rear end bounce and body lean  
Neg, I always thought  147Windstar 148 was a dumb name  Well  it 146s not looking so bad now that they 146ve updated the Windstar and renamed it  147Freestar 148 Why the new name  Well  someone high up at Ford decided it would be neat to begin all Ford car model names with the letter  147F 148 The Mustang and T Bird get grandfathered  but all other Ford car names that begin with a letter other than  147F 148 will soon be history  Why do this  Well  beginning all SUV names with the letter  147E 148 seems to have worked well  Also   147Windstar 148 had a lot of baggage   But apparently not so much to get rid of the  147star 148 bit  The downside of this new strategy is that it seems to be resulting in some awful names  The upcoming Mazda6 based  147Futura 148 isn 146t bad  But the upcoming large sedan  the  147Five Hundred 148 makes no sense to me because there are no other cars whose names are numbers  And  147Freestar 148 what 146s that  At least if they name a car  147Freebird 148 they 146ll have a jingle ready to go Aside from the new name  Ford has made a number of changes to its minivan  The third row now folds Honda style into the floor  A full battery of safety features is now available  including stability control and curtain airbags  The interior materials have been upgraded  And the 200 horsepower 3 8 liter V6 has been replaced by two engines  a 193 horsepower 3 9 and a 201 horsepower 4 2  both based on the 3 8  Why bother upgrading the 3 8 to a 3 9  One reason might be to suggest that the problematic  head gasket blowing 3 8 is history  Well  the basic engine is still here  but hopefully the 3 8 146s weaknesses have been eliminated This model year has seen new minivans from Toyota and Nissan as well  Reviewing the Honda recently  I concluded that none of the existing vans was perfect  Each had significant weaknesses  But I had not yet driven the new Ford  I never thought much of the Windstar  One I drove years ago felt much cruder than other minivans  But might the Freestar somehow surprise me  I took one for a test drive to find out b Styling  The styling of the Windstar always looked awkward to me  Something just was not right with the proportions  For the Freestar most of the sheetmetal remains unchanged  The front fenders and hood are new  though  The new front end is more massive than the old ones and is cleanly styled much like Ford 146s current range of SUVs  with a large trapezoidal grille  Thankfully the long side of the trapezoid is on top  With some Windstars it has been on the bottom  suggesting a frown At any rate  the new front end seems to have done much to lend the van better proportions  The fender flares from the Windstar remain  but they look better on the Frestar 146s larger front fender  Overall  the exterior styling of the Freestar is not strikingly attractive on interesting  but it appears thoroughly tasteful  even somewhat handsome now  Later in the model year optional 17 inch alloys will further improve the look of the van judging from the photos in the brochure  The Toyota Sienna is the new ugly queen in this segment The interior possesses little in the way of style  good or bad  Unless you find the Passat 146s interior stylish  because the Freestar 146s interior is a blatant knock off of the VW sedan 146s  The basic forms are square  most notably the nearly square center stack  Few curves are to be found  The instruments  with their chrome rings  are probably the nicest looking bit  Most off putting is the fake wood in the SEL trim line  The three lower trim lines  S  SE  SES  have matte black on the center stack and a strip of faux aluminum dividing the darker upper part of the instrument panel from the lighter lower part  the rest of the interior is in the lighter shade  With the top of the line Limited both pieces are faux wood  With the SEL  however  only the strip is faux wood  It doesn 146t look so good  Maybe the Limited  with more of the stuff  will look better  Sadly  if you want leather you need one of the top trim lines  so you 146ll be getting some faux wood with it Aside from this bit of trim the quality of the interior is superior to the Windstar 146s  The low gloss materials do not look luxurious  but do look durable  They aren 146t quite up to the Passat 146s  but they were clearly an attempt in that direction compared to past Fords  The leather has a thick  durable feel to it  The top of the dash is soft touch material  the lower part is hard plastic  typical of this class of vehicle  The various buttons feel a bit higher in quality than those of past Fords  The controls are conventionally arranged  unlike the Nissan there is nothing crazy here  Overall  the appearance of the Freestar 146s interior is at least mid pack  better than the Nissan and GM  perhaps a bit nicer than the Honda  and trailing only the Toyota and maybe the Chrysler  the latter comes across as classy overall  but does have some cheap bits   Accommodations  The Freestar at 201 inches is within an inch of most competitors  Yet the interior is tighter than all other extended vans with the possible exception of GM 146s  it has been a while since I sat in the back of a GM minivan  The front seat is roomy enough  with good comfort  The driving position is not my favorite  as the bulky looking instrument panel is a half foot higher than the beltline  bottom of side windows  Especially in a Chrysler the view forward is much more expansive  But some people might prefer the more closed in feeling of the Ford  as it might make them feel safer  As in the Windstar the interior front door panels actually rise a few inches above the beltline  effectively reducing the side glass area  I suspect some market research lay behind this decision Ford continues to offer a second  wide angle rearview mirror to keep tabs on the rear seats  A useful feature that Toyota has copied The pedals in the minivan I drove were adjustable  With the pedals all the way back I had to position the seat all the way back  even though I 146m only 5 9  reducing rear passenger room  I like an arms outstretched driving position  but would likely compromise this when carrying adults in the back  The driver 146s seat itself is memorable for neither discomfort nor exceptional comfort  Still  the front row is easily the best in the van The second row captain 146s chairs feel a little on the small side for adults and are a little too close to the floor to provide good thigh support  Luckily these include build in armrests  for there is none on the door  Get the bench  standard on the S  SE  and SES  and I 146m not sure what passengers will do with their arms  The second row seats tumble forward to provide access to the third row  I found it nearly as easy to simply walk between the captain 146s chairs The third row is perhaps the most cramped of any extended length minivan  It sits low to the floor  providing no thigh support  and because of very thick sidewalls  the left one contains the rear A C  the shoulder room in this row is only 51 inches  more than a foot less than the second row and about a half foot less than you 146ll find in the rear seat of the typical midsize sedan  Notably  the Honda Odyssey provides over ten inches more third row shoulder room  Yet only two people sit in the Ford 146s second row even with the bench  while three sit in the third row  I don 146t get it  Legroom  or more specifically footroom  is also limited in the third row  The culprits are very thick inner pedestrals under the second row captain 146s chairs  Between these pedestals there is only room for one foot to squeeze in  Where should the second foot go  The second row seats adjust fore and aft a few inches to juggle legroom  However  although the seat moves the pedestals do not  So moving the seat doesn 146t help unless you move it so far up that third row passengers can put their feet on top of the pedestals  At that point the second row will have no legroom Overall the Freestar 146s rear seating and roominess is very disappointing  Compared to the Toyota Sienna  it offers 2 2 inches less legroom in the front seats  1 6 inches less in the second row  and a huge 6 8 inches less in the third row  As moving seats back and forth shifts legroom from row to row  these numbers are cumulative  for a total legroom disadvantage of over ten inches  This despite the fact that the Freestar is an inch longer than the Toyota in both overall length and wheelbase The Freestar s third row seat does stow into the deep well provided for it fairly easily  Three clearly labelled steps are involved  one more than in the Odyssey  The extra latch permits the seat to be rotated rearward 90 degrees to serve as a bench for tailgating while the van is parked  Unlike in the Nissan  the tether used to pull the third row into the well is long enough to extend outside the well  The split bench in the Toyota is the easiest to stow  but the Ford edges out the Honda  and the Nissan is by far the most difficult  and finger threatening  In the Ford  unlike in the Honda and Nissan  the headrests do not have to be removed before stowing the seat  The downside is that they  and those in the second row  are not high enough in their lowest position to protect adults When the third row is in place the deep well can be used for cargo  It is a good size to hold grocery bags upright  preventing their contents from rolling about the entire floor  The maximum cargo volume  134 cubic feet  is about ten cubic feet shy of the extended minivan norm  Probably those thick rear sidewalls again On the upper trim lines a center console is a  150 option  It isn 146t very tall  not even coming up to the level of the seat cushions  and contains only a sedan sized storage compartment  It is not very wide because the parking brake  like the Windstar 146s  is between the front seats  The center consoles available in the Chrysler and Toyota vans are significantly larger  Other storage compartments are located in the Freestar 146s center stack  roof console  doors  and atop the center of the instrument panel  A fairly large glove compartment is also provided  There is plenty of storage aside from the optional console  but some people will still want it because of its handy location b On the Road  The 4 2 liter 146s 201 peak horsepower trails all the GM vans 146 3 4 liter among extended length minivans  but it leads them all in midrange power  with 263 pounds feet of torque at a moderate 3650 RPM  Even the 3 9 produces 245 pounds feet  tying the Chrysler 3 8 and leading all others  Unlike the Honda  Toyota  and top line Nissan  however  Ford continues to use a four speed automatic  Perhaps because its gearing is thus taller than the others  or because the revised engine still falls well short of Honda 146s and Toyota 146s in refinement  noise quality at full throttle  and willingness to rev  acceleration with the 4 2 feels just adequate  The Japanese vans and especially the Honda feel considerably quicker  That said  how quick does a minivan need to feel From behind the wheel the Freestar feels larger and heavier than the competition  partly due to the relatively high instrument panel but also due to the chassis dynamics  The van understeers heavily in turns and generally communicates that it does not wish to be hurried  The steering is not overly light  unlike many past Ford products  Lean is moderate The payoff for this below average handling is excellent ride quality  This ride quality I suspect that Ford 146s engineers derived their priorities from those of van buyers  I drove the Freestar along a road full of chuckholes and very uneven expansion joints  Cars generally ride poorly on this road  but in the Freestar imperfections were heard only a little and felt even less  This ride quality was obtained through intelligent design  not simply through ultra soft suspension settings  As a result  the van remain composed over rough surfaces and did not bobble about b Safety  Like the Windstar the Freestar should ace crash tests  It offers traction control  stability control  front seat airbags  and curtain airbags in all three rows  as much safety equipment as can be found on any minivan  Topping the others  the last as in the Explorer is linked to a rollover sensor and functions as a canopy keeping people from hitting the ceiling in the event of such an accident  I doubt many minivans roll over  but if one did this would be good to have b Pricing  The  147price paid 148 listed below is the sticker price of the van I drove  To make the Freestar more comparable to other minivans  especially the Honda Odyssey with its very limited feature flexibility  I will compare a Windstar SEL with leather  power sliding doors  side and side curtain airbags  traction control  stability control  and rear obstacle detection  The list price is  33 230 and the price after discount and rebate to about  28 900  Heated seats and automatic temperature control are only available on the Limited  which even after adjusting for major content runs about  850 more  Those uninterested in the Limited 146s two tone paint  turn signal indicators in the mirrors  message center  and so forth will be better off getting aftermarket seat heaters installed  Those who love every last knick knack should of course get the Limited Note  Currently in many regions the  975 package that includes stability control  traction control  and rear obstacle detection is free on Limiteds and  750 on SELs  I have included these discounts in my comparisons  The Odyssey EX L lists for  28 980  Likely because of the increased competition  Honda increased prices only  90 from 2003 and its dealers are now discounting these vans  but still not by much  Edmunds suggests that the typical discount reduces the price to about  28 200  After adjusting for content differences  the Honda lacks stability control  curtain airbags  adjustable pedals  and rear obstacle detection but has heated seats and automatic temperature control  the Honda is about  200 more expensive  The Honda is easily worth the extra money because of its superior powertrain  roomier interior  more comfortable rear seats  and less rapid depreciation The hot van is now the Toyota Sienna  The Sienna 146s options are bundled much like the Ford 146s  Toyota 146s new system which puts everything into a huge number of packages is very confusing  but I waded through the descriptions to find the best one   12 of 21 XLE packages  The list price of a Sienna XLE with Package 12 and floormats is  32 871  and Edmunds suggests no discounting  Adjusting for equipment differences  sunshades  automatic climate control  heated seats  17 inch wheels  power liftgate  center console  JBL sound system  would narrow the gap by about  1 450  Even with a  2 500 price disadvantage  1 650 with the Limited  the Toyota still seems the better buy  but the Honda is better still The Nissan Quest SL is equipped between the Toyota and the Honda  It has curtain airbags  fold flat second row captain 146s chairs  rear obstacle detection  power passenger 146s seat  power liftgate  adjustable pedals  and fixed skylights in back rows  but it has no driver 146s side power slider and its automatic has only four speeds  It lists for  30 030  Dealer discounts reduce this to around  29 400  Adjusted for content the Nissan is about  100 more than the Ford  The Nissan is a less refined vehicle with inferior interior materials  but it has a larger interior  many innovative features  and striking styling  so those who care about such things should check it out In reaction to the Odyssey 146s relatively low prices  Chrysler introduced value models of its minivans three years ago  A Town   Country eX with leather and side airbags lists for  30 500  The typical discount and a  1 000 rebate reduce this to about  28 000  The Chrysler has a power passenger seat and power liftgate  and its third row does not fold flat  but is otherwise equipped like the Honda  Adjusted for equipment it is about  350 less expensive  The Chrysler feels a bit more agile and is roomier  the Ford has the trick third row  GM offers the least expensive extended minivans once discounts and rebates are taken into account   The Kia Sedona is cheaper still but is considerably smaller than the others  and at any rate only marginally competitive  The GM vans are less roomy and powerful than the others  but despite the oldest chassis here they handle fairly well  especially in their short wheelbase variants  Their weakest area may be cheap looking interiors  The seats 146 appearance is especially disappointing  but leather helps a great deal  A fold flat third row is available  but only with cloth  A Pontiac Montana equipped as closely as possible to the above Ford lists for  31 250  but the typical discount and a  2 500 rebate reduces this to about  26 200  Adjusted for content the GM van is  1 700 less  For another  230 you can get a sport suspension complete with automatic leveling  a rarity in this class  I have not tested a GM van so equipped  so I cannot evaluate this option  An old design but still worthy of consideration by those seeking the lowest price and good handling in an extended length van Except for the Toyota Sienna on the high end and the GM vans on the low end  all of the extended length minivans are priced within a few hundred dollars of each other right now  All of them are arguably better buys than the Ford  but only the Honda is clearly a better choice I do not like how Ford has made heated seats and automatic climate control  two popular features  available only on the knick knack laden Limited  For those uninterested in all the bells and whistles the Limited is about  1 000 less competitive than the SEL  I also find it odd that the SES  with its slightly sportier exterior  cannot be bought with many popular features  including leather b Last Words  The Freestar was the only extended minivan I had not driven  I expected little based on my evaluation of the Windstar  but was prepared to be surprised  I was not surprised  The Freestar rides well and has a fairly nice interior  but its handling  room  and seat comfort are at best marginally competitive  I cannot recommend this vehicle  The Honda and Chrysler seem the best products when price is considered  It so happens that both will be revised for 2005  As I suggest in my Odyssey review  If you can wait  then wait My reviews of related vehicles b a href content 12511907460 Chrysler Town and Country a b    a href content 119778610820 Honda Odyssey a b b a href content 56591027844 Kia Sedona a b b a

Neg, About a month ago  I purchased a new 2003 Ford Explorer XLT Sport  4 door not to be confused with the 2 door Sport  Major options I chose were leather  moonroof  and a 6 disc in dash CD player with 7 speakers  A few other nice touches that came with it are the auto headlamps and auto dimming rearview mirror  I didn t want the 3rd row seating and it was difficult to locate one that didn t have it  but my dealer came through and located one for me   I d rather spend the extra cash on leather instead of a 3rd row seat that s hardly ever going to be used  The Sport package on the XLT upgrades the tires from 16  to 17  with different aluminum wheels  and includes side step boards  door handles that match the color of the vehicle  and platinum painted cladding and fender moldings  These cosmetic touches are minor but really do make the vehicle look a lot nicer  In fact  these features are also part of the much higher priced Eddie Bauer package I like the exterior styling of the Explorer  It s simple yet tasteful  and not overly done with cheap looking plastic cladding or gimmicky stuff like that  It s not a Hummer and doesn t pretend to be one  One exterior feature worth mentioning is the rear hatch  Most SUV s have a rear window that flips up in addition to the whole hatch opening  Well the Explore has this feature as well  but the window plus a portion of the door flips up which makes it easier to put stuff in the back since you don t have to raise a bag of groceries for example  above your shoulders to load through the opening  I am extremely pleased with the layout and quality of the materials of the interior  The quality of the leather is great  and the leather wrapped steering wheel feels solid  The gauges are nicely laid out  again nothing fancy  There is a compass and temperature display with the digital odometer  The CD player is mounted high on the dash  which I like  above the A C controls  There are 3 cup holders  an outlet to plug in a cellphone  and a very deep floor console that stores a lot of stuff  The pockets in the doors are spacious and formed so a large water bottle can fit  Pretty cool  The audio system sounds awesome  and there are a lot of cool settings to change the output to suit different tastes and styles of music This SUV rides so nicely that I have to remind myself it s not a car  Of course  it doesn t ride as nice as a car  but it rides MUCH nicer than any SUV I ve ever been in before  It doesn t have that pick up truck feel that most SUVs have  When you hit a bump  you don t bounce up and down for another 100 yards  The 17  tires really grip  and the month long snow storm that just fell where I live put the 4WD to the test  and this baby passed with flying colors  At first I was a bit skeptical about the 210HP V6 having enough power for an SUV of this size  but that thing puts out enough torque to move it nicely and has a surprisingly nice growl to it  The size of the vehicle is nice  also  Not too big  not too small  Some friends have told me that they think the SUV is huge  but I remind them that it s about a foot shorter in length than a Ford Taurus and the same width  and they are always surprised In general  I am very pleased with my Explorer and think it was well worth every penny  I can t think of any one thing that I can complain about  As I mentioned  the gas mileage isn t great but it s better than I anticipated it to be  I always find it ridiculous when SUV owners complain about gas mileage  If gas mileage is important to you  then don t buy an SUV  To me  it s like a biker complaining about the safety of their motorcycle  Anyway  before I get off on a rant quality appears to be Job 1 at Ford again  
Neg, I recently wrote a review of the 98 Ford explorer xlt  V8  AWD  I hate this car  which thank god  my lease is up this summer  I recently rode in a friends 99 explorer  XLT  V6  AWD  Although ford made several minor improvements  I still think this auto is an overpriced piece of garbage  It is overpriced  underpowered  and is generally just a low quality  high maintenance SUV  I have had many  many problems with my explorer  and my friend said the same thing  Also  on top of all the problems  their service is terrible  I think if you are considering buying this auto  look elsewhere  I recommend looking at the jeep line  or go with an import  You ll be very happy you did br br  
Neg, We have owned a couple Ford Aerostars  The 1990 model had several flaws  The drivers seat was broken through normal wear and tear  The Anti Lock Break notification light has never worked properly  yet there was never a recall or anything  And the worst aspect of both is that these two and most of these models I have seen  are more apt to rust then other vehicles  They are both have rusted out the bottom side panel between the front and rear tires  The 1988 van has ran fairly well  however the 1990 model has had numerous mechanical problems  Many flaws have resulted from the mini vans  From the alternator not failing to a leaking gas tank  They also have shakey starters in them as well  and a fuel injected engine that will not start without pressing the gas pedal br br  
Neg, We were fed up with the cost of repairing our old camper van so we set out to lease a truck  The  99 F 150 series appealed to us with a solid build  reasonable cost  and great looks  We got our new truck off the lot and within the first 14 days the transmission blew  Apparently  someone hadn t installed a part properly  The warning lights came on first but the handbook did not direct us to stop driving   just recommended to get it in for servicing We ve had more trouble since  with those warning lights coming on without any other symptoms attached  The good news   we only have to keep the truck for three years and the problems are under warranty  The bad news   this truck spends as much time in the shop as our 20 year old camper van   it s hard to go camping when it breaks down  VERY DISAPPOINTING br br  
Neg, I have worked in the Automobile Manufacturing business most of my adult life  NO ONE has more stingent quality standards to uphold than Ford  I have supplied parts to every domestice manufacturer you can name  I have owned a Ranger for 12 years and now have a 93 Ford 150 4X4  I have loved both trucks  Especially the 150 is built very solidly  When the door shuts it shuts to a great fit  you can hear it On the new 150 I am not sure I like the new body  I liked the look of the pre 96 trucks esp the 95  The area I know live in seems to be GM truck land  My friends that all drive trucks prefer the GM  by far  then the Ford with the Dodge Ram being close to the Ford  There are more GMs in this area then Fords and Rams put together  My friends report that they prefer the GMs for these reasons 1 Styling  do not like the body look of 150 or Ram 2 Perceived Reliablity  Fords seem to have the reputation of using much more gas per relative engine size  as the GMs 3 All Full Size pickups are very expensive  most around here are 4x4s  and GM is the most  slightly  However GMs seem to hold their resale value and are worth much more worth the value  in this area If I was buying a brand new truck  at present it would be a GM     
Neg, I have a 96 F 350 4x4 with 351 eng  and C6 Trans  In 17000 miles I have lost both exhaust manifolds due to leakage  The transmission went out a spark plug rusted into the head and broke off the calipars have stuck causing poor braking the paint white vehicle developes small rust spots on it and mileage is 10 mph at best The service writer at ford told me that ford has had a problem for years with exhaust manifolds especially on 351 eng her own mid 90s ford developed the same rust problems When I bought the truck I told salesman I was going to use it as a tow vehicle  I tow a 3500lb trailer and this eng trans combination with 4 10 gears has all it can handle  Ford must be doing better with the newer super duties  On yah I was told by the dealer that ford has now fixed the premature problems with exhaust manifolds they do not use that eng  anymore  Good fix     
Neg, I don t even know where to begin  This car  while I had it  had so many problems  It seemed like everyday  there was another problem  First of all  to be fair I ll list the good parts about this car  its 1 6 liter H O  engine does produce a lot of power for a small engine  I have actually beaten V8 Chevy s and Fords off the line  And it cruises with no problem at high speeds  That s probably about the only good thing about this car  The car itself has a very bland boring design  It actually looks pretty ugly   Don t ask me why I got it  The interior is very cramped and there are no back seats Problems 1  Leaking winshield and sunroof 2  Car is so loud  you can t hear yourself think 3  When you turn the vent on  all you get is a smell of gasoline 4  Interior smells horrible 5  Handling stinks  and power steering squeaks when you turn 6  Shocks and suspension are horrible  can feel every bump on the road 7  Horrible gas mileage  15 19 mpg  and I thought this was supposed to be an economy car 8  Frequent problem with the engine  Overheating  burning and leaking oil 9  Car spent more time in the mechanics garage than mine 10  Half the options on the car failed  cruise control  AC  etc  Ok  this is pretty much my message  STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAR  Its not worth it  for  1000  treat yourself to a vacation or something  You ll definitely need one after dealing with this car

previous bad experience  this young man was very nice  Although the situation was much different  and was giving the 4 women ahead of me choices  It appeared no one wanted to drive the  Ford F150   I

  This truck is the  2003 4 door SuperCrew XLT 4 Wheel Drive Styleside with an automatic transmission b  It has a 4 6 liter engine with 8 cylinders  This is a powerful  huge truck  The truck has a little more than 14 000 miles on it   Remember it is a rental but in fantastic condition  I will attempt not to compare it with my BMW but I can t promise  I do have our Chevy S 10 in mind  though these trucks are very different as well  The Ford F150 has a 25 gallon gas tank with an estimated  gas mileage  of 14 miles per gallon in the city and 19 on the highway  It has so many features that are standard there aren 146t too many options that I would look for except perhaps heated seats  Standard  not an inclusive list  includes automatic transmission  front independent suspension front stabilizer bar  clock  external temperature display  Which I have on my BMW and really love  low fuel level warning  compass  and trailer wiring cargo tie downs  Which we need because we tow a 21 foot travel trailer  a href content 87725346436 Sun Lite a This truck has a  seating capacity of 6 people b  The front has a 40 60 split bench front seats which mean that the driver 146s seat is separate from the other two seats which are attached  The front driver 146s seat is also a little longer than the rest of the bench  A fantastic feature is  lumbar supports  for both the driver and the passenger via a round lever  It makes a huge difference  One reason I don 146t like the Chevy is because it is so uncomfortable  I found the Ford F150 to be quite comfortable There is cloth upholstery and in the car I am driving it is a soft material and in gray  What I had never seen is the compartment between the driver and the window passenger  If you only have 2 people in the front you can put down a compartment  I can 146t call it an arm rest because it really doesn 146t come out long enough to rest my arm  that holds cups and storage  This truck has quite a bit of  storage  except for the glove compartment  What looks huge is actually tiny once you open it  There is storage on the doors and on the roof for glasses and kleenex  Note though that there is a  bump   It isn 146t huge like in a bucket seat car  where the middle passenger sits  The is so much head and leg room that comfort in the front isn 146t an issue   The back  has cup holders as well and a split bench  It is divided as in 1 3 and 2 3rd  There are two head rests  2 3rds of the back bench fold down but not all the way but enough to get to a place where there is a small holding compartment where the jack is kept  The other 1 3rd seat does the same  There are also rear heating ducts The truck has remote power door locks  power windows  power mirrors  cruise control  front and rear 12volt power outlets  air conditioning  front and rear reading lights  dual illuminating vanity mirrors and a leather wrapped steering wheel  Other specs include Front Head Room  39 8 in  Front Hip Room  59 8 in  Front

looks nice in white  Other colors are black  beige  red  burgundy  green  dark green  gray  dark gray  silver and a couple of shades of blue It has an AM FM radio with a cassette player with 4 speakers and 80 watts of stereo output  The radio sounds terrific There are no side airbags  you may want to note  Also please  note  that this truck is high  Luckily it has handles near the 4 doors you can hold onto to lift yourself up  For many  though  the height of this truck will be a problem   How the car handles    The first thing I noticed when driving this truck which did not go away with time were the  bumps  I felt  I think the truck found every bump on the road or made up some on the way  That is a real negative for me because we drive for long periods of time and if we are spending this much money will spend a bit more for a vehicle that will tow and that won 146t get me car sick  The second thing I noticed was the  outside noise b  That seemed to diminish in time  Of course it really didn 146t  I just noticed it less  I could  for example  use my cell phone 146s voice command without being told it was too noisy  The third thing I noticed was that it didn 146t  stop  like my BMW  OK I know I said I wouldn 146t compare  but this is a truck  It stops just like our Chevy a bit too slowly for me  Stepping hard on the brake will stop the truck immediately but just pushing on it will have it come to a slow stop  The fourth thing I noticed was the  steering b  Considering how big this truck is it handles well  It corners much better than I expected  though I did move with the truck  For something this size I didn 146t expect the steering to handle so well  I easily passed cars that I was too close to and got into the lane again with no problem The fifth thing I noticed was the  acceleration b  OK it is a truck but with 8 cylinders I expect more power  I had to really give it gas to get up a hill at 65 miles an hour  I never feared for my life when merging onto the highway  there is enough pickup for me to say it accelerates well enough  I 146m just not used to having to put my foot down on the accelerator so hard to get it going  I could feel it go into gear as I accelerated as well   I could also feel the truck at 70 miles an hour b  I wasn 146t afraid of going to fast in this Ford because it told me when we were above the speed limit  150 it shook a little bit  I had a Maxima that did that and I don 146t like that  We travel in places where there are no speed limits so I 146d like to be able to do 80 without feeling it  The  safety  of this truck is not good according to http www hwysafety org vehicle ratings ce html summary lgpickup htm 0110  The overall is poor as is the safety of your chest  head and neck  left foot is acceptable  right is marginal and the restraints  using a dummy  are poor  150 that is they don t keep you safe enough  The standard basic  warranty  including the drivetrain and roadside assistance is 3 years or 36 000 miles  The warranty for rust is 5 years  This is one of the worse warranties I have seen  150 at least comparing it to cars b In summary    I have said many times that if I looked at the crash tests on vehicles I probably wouldn 146t get into one  but these letters  P poor  are glaring  Can I not recommend a truck based on that alone  Perhaps but there are other reasons I can 146t recommend it  I love the lumbar support  though why it is manual I don 146t know when everything is power  Then again in my BMW my seat lever is manual in spite of other things being power  Among the things mentioned  150 the bumps  the noise  the fact that the middle person in the front has a bump under their legs  does that make it a 5 seater then  really  the fact that the acceleration isn 146t what I would like nor is the ability to stop  and the climb up it will get 3 stars since I like it better than my Chevy which I don 146t recommend either  So it is an average truck  I am sure there are better  I love the 4 doors and the 7 000 pound towing capability which is what we need  but other than that  I know I 146ll look elsewhere If you have any questions about this car  feel free

Neg, The Expedition is one in a long list of truck based SUV s  It s basically a short wheelbase Ford F 150 with a steel roof in back instead of a bed  and a rear seat or two  So  despite their bulk  and popular misconception  they re actually not as unwieldy as your typical extended cab pickup is  because of the shorter wheelbase  Ford also tosses in a few minor luxury features and softens the suspension to differentiate it from the pickup and also to somehow justify the whopping  9 000 price differential  Expensive rear seats and roof  aren t they Here are my impressions on the Expedition Exterior Styling  While not glamourous or sexy  the styling works  It s a bit top heavy  due to the cargo maximizing design  and the wheels are a bit narrowly offset  with more body overhang than I d like  But who are we kidding  You re hauling around babyseats in the back  You won t be crusing the boulevard in this SUV  Interior  Much like the F 150  it s functional  though it retains some of it s truck based look and feel  Buttons are large and well placed  the guages are easy to read  and the center console is huge and very useful  Cupholders are fine  which is one of my  quot must haves quot  Interior materials are tasteful  better than the Chevy Tahoe  but there is still a somewhat plasticy look you have to pay  40 000 for an SUV to avoid  My main problem with the interior  and this vehicle in general  is Ford s incredibly uncomfortable seats and seating position  I am 6 0 quot  and cannot seem to find a position which does not induce severe discomfort after a minute or two  The seat back is too hard  and there is a lack of proper side bolstering to hold you in when the body rolls in turns and roll it does  When I get the seat set where my legs are happy  I can t reach the wheel easily  This causes major back pain from overreaching  And when I get the seat set so my hands feel right  my knees feel crowded under the dash  The 2000 models have been improved somewhat with adjustable pedals and improved seat materials  but they are still not the greatest  Be sure to test drive the Expedition well before buying  You may regret it if you can t get comfortable  Rear seat room is cavernous  with plenty of room to put in car seats and full sized passengers  Three accross seating is acceptable  at least for short trips  The 3rd row seats are a weak point  however  They come in handy when hauling large groups  but are best suited for children  The problem  as with most 3rd row seats  is that though they re best suited for small kids  it s hard to get the very small kids back there and buckled in  So again  it s best for occasional use  Buy a minivan if you are always hauling a team around  The A C and stereo systems are acceptable  though nothing special  I would suggest aftermarket upgrading if you are an audiophile and skipping the included upgraded CD system  Ride handling braking  This is never the strong point of an SUV  but the Expedition has a smooth ride  due to its soft springs and suspension setting  Wind noise is acceptable  but handling suffers  at least on 2wd models  due to the excessive body roll  This is a subjective thing  but you tend to wallow in turns and it limits your ability to maneuver in emergency situations  Braking is adequate  though it s no sports sedan  Part of the safety factor of big SUV s is negated by their inability to maneuver as quickly to actually avoid an accident  So drive within the vehicle s limits Engine driveline  The 4 6L V 8 is a tad underpowered by modern standards for a vehicle this size  but it certainly isn t a pig  The 5 4L gets up and going faster  but adds to the cost and reduces fuel mileage slightly  If you re hauling a lot of gear and people  spring for the bigger engine  If you re choosing between a less opulently outfitted Expedition and a loaded Explorer  choose the Expedition and the cheaper engine  It s a much better value  The transmission is smooth  with none of the lurching I ve found on Chyrsler products  It s not in the class of a Toyota Tundra  however  But few other trucks and SUV s are  when it comes to smoothness Reliability Safety Ford Expeditions have been fairly reliable  The one I ve spent time in has zero breakdowns or warranty problems in 38 000 miles  I would rank them above Chrysler and GM products  though behind Japanese and German makes  The dealer network ranks from great to pathetic  so ask around to find a good dealer  I have two excellent ones in my area  Safety is a great reason to pay the extra money to get a full sized SUV rather than a more practical compact  5 000 lbs of bulk and increased ride height goes a long way in protecting your family in a crash  Expeditions have not been tested  but the similar F 150 has outstanding crash test results  Some of the best around  in fact  Missing are side and head protection airbags  But only the most high end cars had them when the Expedition was introduced  Expect to see them in the next re design  If you are looking for a minivan alternative and need seating for more than 5  the Expedition is a good choice  The new Tahoes have a slight advantage in the on the road experience  but I would be wary of their spotty reliablity  With the Optional 3rd row seat  you can carry 7 on a long trip  But if you re like me and others I know  and can t get comfortable in the front seats  this vehicle is NOT the one for you  It s unfortunate  because this SUV is a good value for the money So is the Expedition really a beached whale  Well  if you do not have a family or do not really need the extra space  there are some newer  smaller  better driving SUV s on the market  They will be more nimble and cost less to operate  I am very impressed with the new Acura SUV  It s slightly more than a loaded Expedition  but gives you a better  faster ride  more refinement  Acura warranty and quality  and more maneuverability in parking lots  It s somewhat smaller  but the

Neg, Two years ago  I had been dreaming about owning one of those monsters I had been seeing on the roads  The Ford Expedition  I love big Trucks and this one had just come out the year before  It looked classy  sporty and aggressive at the same time  So I went SUV shopping  I drove the Durango  the Isuzu  and many others  Many but the Tahoe  I cannot tell you why  Maybe it was just the shape of it  it looked old  They had remaind he same for years  a big rectangular box on wheels Well  I ended up leasing a brand new 98 Eddie Bauer Ford Expedition  I live in the South East where it never snows and I don t have time to go off road  so I decided to save money but getting the 2WD  This truck just has everyhting on it  Awesome 7 speaker stereo  power everything  6CD changer  turning signal integrated in the mirrors for aded safety  lit running board  third row seat  automatic lights  leater seats  power driver seat  etc  It is very very roomy expct for people seating in the third row seat  but let s not be too demanding  It  quot seemed quot  luxurious and safe and so big  i loved it  we had taken the 5 4 liter V8 whihc I Highly recommend considering the size and weight of this truck  The standard 4 6L has a hard time moving this truck in and out of traffic The 5 4L is powerful and is enough  However  it is noisy  When you pus the pedal down the cabin fills with noise and it is quite disppointing for 36k luxuary car  After driving this truck for a year  and driving other cars and SUVS  I quikcly became more and more disappointed  What I thought was luxury  was just a facade  Plastic elements are of poor quality and are poorly assembled  There are too many large gaps betwee dashboard elements and doors  etc  Second disappointment  after the excitment of buying the Expedition was gone  was the lack of torque and power  Drive an expdition  then a Tahoe  and you ll understand what i am talking about  The Chevy powerplant is a lot more powerful and efficient  it ll let you spin the wheels at a red light  The expedition is more like an  quot Escargot quot  Third and major disappointment is the ride mainly over bumps  holes  and the handling in curves  You might not realize it as a driver  but seat on the right side a few times and it ll become obvious  I was wondering why my wife kept comlaining about my driving  The truck bounces you all over the places when turing  braking a little hard  or drivig on older bumpy roads  It also tends to lie on its side when turning  A 36 0000 dollar luxury SUV should not bounce you so bad and force you to hold on tight ot the door handle and the dash board  unless you wnat a work out i do not feel as safe driving it now I have since driven a TAHOE and ridden in a SUBURBAN  the engine is a lot more powerful and adequate for such a car  and the ride is a lot more comfortable Finally  I will end saying that in a year I had to take my Brand New 36k Expediiton to the shop twice  thre parts broke in the sunroof  10 days without a car and the Auto Air Valve broke Make sure you ride the Chevy trucks before giving up to the good looks of the Expedition  and to the image of driving one Good car hunting     
Neg, The Ford Expedition is supposed to be a top of the notch vehicle  however  there are many little things that just bring down the whole vehicle  First of all there is no trunk space  If you have a car that is made to hold 8 people  there needs to be room to put all of their things  My family got the car because we have 6 people all of whom are involved in soccer  We need the large car to travel to our soccer games and tournaments  There is never room to put all of our bags  Another problem is that when the seats are put down  they don t align properly  On long trips  it is so nice to be able to put down the seats and make it into a bed  But since the seats are uneven  the bed is very uncomfortable  Another problem that just irks me is the windows  The back windows don t go down all the way  They go too low to be for child safety  You can t put your arms out of the window and they get an annoying dirt line on them that is hard to get rid of  If you haven t noticed I m speaking from the passengers point of view  But I have also driven it many times  The seats are rather hard and uncomfortable  I have a Jeep Grand Cherokee which has extremely comfortable seats and the transition to the Expedition is not a good one  The Expedition does drive nicely  It shifts very smoothly  It has average gas mileage and is relatively smooth riding   Except once when it hydroplaned on the interstate not good at all  All together I would not recommend the Expedition  If you are buying as a car that you would like to be comfortable for your passengers  as I assume you are since you are buying a car made for eight  I would recommend something more like a Suburban br br  
Neg, MY family has leased a 1998 Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer Version for 3 years now  We have been fairly happy with it considering there are 3 kids and 2 adults  WE have had more than our fair share of problems with this  truck  which i will explain later on  This car is best used on the highway considering it gets horrible gas mileage in the city and its still not that great on the highway  I would suggest leasing this car instead of just plain buying it becuase you dont want to buy this car and turn around and hate it like lots of people i know  There are several pluses to this car though 1  No one will ever cut you off or get in your way  and i mean never 2  Very safe in crashes 3  Good in wintry conditions such as snow but bad in ice since there is such a high center of gravity 4  Seats 8 5  Lots of storage space 6  Fairly nice sound system 7  They are very inexpensive at the dealerships right now 8  Removeable back seat Now for the not so good things 1  Insurance is sky high 2  Horrible gas mileage 3  Tons of mechanical problems 4  Loud 5  Drinks fall out of cup holders 6  Antena gets scratched if you go in your garage so in about a year you have to spend money to get a new antena 7  Vary hard to park 8  Bad turning radius 9  Possibility to flip over 10  cd player is in center counsol so you cant change cd s or anything while driving 11  Hard to wash 12  Very expensive to get repainted or get fixed Now for the problems we had 1 Windows got stuck and would not come up all the time during the summer 2  Oil leaks constantly 3  Winshield wipers wear out in about 4 months 4  Paint peeled 5  Tons of problems with our fule pump 6  Leather on seats tor for no reason 7  Winshield wiper on back window never worked and never will I suggest getting a smaller suv such as a cherokee or explorer  
Neg, Don t personally own a Ford Explorer  but can tell you it s not for me  I have ridden in a few in my time and I am not pleased at all  Yes they may be roomy  yes they may have comfort options and extras  but not for me  Personally  I am not all for extremely large vehicles  I believe barges should float on the water  not on four wheels taking up the roadway  Granted  if you have a large family and need a sporty type utility vehicle  you may appreciate the roominess that the Explorer has to offer  As a person who doesn t like not being able to see out of her personal car  I would not want to drive this  let alone attempt to back it up  park it  or heaven forbid  parallel park it  I wonder how many people have actually driven these monsterous crafts to take their driver s license exam in  I would speculate so bravely as to say that unless you drive a tractor trailer on a daily basis  you d probably fail the exam  Personally know a mechanic who complains of working on these vehicles way too much  They are a busy operation and they see about 10 15 of these each week with many problems  Don t consider them too dependable  For the price  I don t think I would be too pleased  If I were going to pay that kind of price for an automobile  I d just as soon go by a sports car  At least then I could see what was beside me  behind me  and yes  even in front of me     
Neg, When my friends started to find out I was driving an expedition they all called me big  quot pimpin quot  Shawn  Cause The big SUV s are supposedly  quot pimpin quot  cars  Well when you look at them  yeah they are very nice in a monsterous way  They are hogs of the road  They need one of those signs on it that says oversized load  I don t like driving it cause its just too big  I always park it as far away from the other cars at parking lots cause I m afraid I might not be able to get out of the car  or worse yet not able to back it out of the parking spot  The worst part of the car is it s amazing ineffeciency with gas  I end up never useing the air conditioner  because the amount of money I m spending on gas is just so ludicrous  And it is taking it s toll on me  I live in southern California where the temperatures are soaring into unbearable levels  I can t complain about the amount of space the car has  It is very roomy  and you can fit like 7 people in it comfortably  This is defenitly a plus when your the designated driver at a pary or something of importance like that  If you have no need for the very large amount of space this car has  DO NOT PURCHASE IT  however if you have to move around a bunch of kids every day  or you need a very large carpool  THIS IS THE CAR FOR YOU     
Neg, We used to drive down the road and be jealous of all the people who were driving the NEW style Mustang so when we could afford one we bought it  It was sitting in the back lot  it was white and all the dirt had settled on it from sitting  With the shortage of mustangs around we were thrilled to find one but we couldn t figure out why it wasn t on the showroom floor  They didn t have any convertibles on display  only hard tops  It seems that South Florida is the place for convertibles year round and that s what we wanted 21 000 later we had BRAND NEW Mustang convertible 6 cylinder  white top and white paint grey interior and 350 miles on it when we drove it off the lot  We were thrilled  it was our Christmas present  Eight days after we purchased our NEW car it was a rainy New Years eve and I saw the car parked by the school 4 miles from home and nobody was in it  I thought someone had stolen it  A policeman drove by asking why the car was there  he thought it was stolen Walking in the rain was my son and he said the car let out with a bunch of steam and the engine quit  So we had it towed to the dealership and they were closed but when they looked at the car they told us we did something to make this happen  But we didn t  They had the car for almost a month and a factory rep came down to look at it and there was a factory defect in the engine which caused the engine to blow  I wanted my money back and they said NO  A new  21 000 car and a blown engine  That could effect the transmission etc  They did give me  1200 back for the extended warentee but they let us keep the warentee  That was a deal  We had the car for 15 months and a humming in the middle to rear of the car started  It got worse  There was also a vibration with it too  We took it in many times anf finally I found out there was a defect in the torque converters and Ford was keeping it hush hush because they didn t have enough torque converters to replace it on all the cars  I didn t want the car  Luckily we live in Florida with the Lemon Law and we got back EVERY Penny we paid for the car  I was thankful for that  I felt FORD made it good so I used all that money and ordered a new 1998 Mustang convertible laserred 6 cylinder  We felt it was a fluke that we had problems with the first Mustang The second Mustang we did eventually have problems with the torque converter but the dealer said there was nothing wrong with it  That s another story  See my write up about it and my 2000 GT     
Neg, My roomate recently bought a 2000 Ford Explorer Sport  The SUV is really nice but it is too bumpy and can flip very easily  The front seats aren t very comfortable and the back seat is awful  I feel like I m sitting on a big pile of wood  If you are going to have 3 people in the back make sure one of them is a kid so they can sit in between the seatbelts in the middle of the seat  At least the child is small enough to where they don t sit on them  They hurt pretty bad when you sit on them  The back hatch or 3rd door is nice but really heavy  If you are a woman you will probably have to use two hands to pull it down to close it  Now for the side doors  after a few months of opening and closing the doors they get to where you have to slam them shut  It starts to get very hard and annoying to close the doors  If you own and know about the  quot free quot  oil changes that you can purchase for 2 or 3 years  have all your paperwork with you the first and second time you go to the dealership to have it done  If you don t and Ford doesn t have you in the system or says that they have never heard of that before  you will end up paying for it and fighting with Ford to get your money back for that oil change  After 1 or 2 times it gets better  They usually have you in the system by then  The body of the SUV is really nice but not nice enough for me to own one I ll have to stick with the Chevy Tahoe in this category br br  
Neg,   Disclaimer i  Attempts at a detailed analysis  based on the intensifiction of the fight between the two giants  Call this bitter battle between these two giant companies whatever you want  Call it the battle of the sturdy CEOs  Lampe and Nasser  John and Jacques  The battle of the cream of the creams  You may even want to call the breakup of relationship a divorce of Ford Motor Co from Bridgestone Firestone  All of this has come after numerous fatal accidents and recalls of tires by both companies  The victims have filed lawsuits in the meantime  In what ways will this public battle benefit regular  poor and suffering consumers  Their loved ones are long gone  No camp appears to take the blame for the lack of safety and the shredding and peeling of tires in last year s series of accidents  One of the protaganists seems to say something that includes the consumers whose heart  money and business both camps are looking for  There may be some grain of truth to this statement by Bridgestone Firestone president John Lampe   Business relationships  like personal ones  are built upon trust and mutual respect We have come to the conclusion that we can no longer supply tires to Ford since the basic foundation of our relationship has been seriously eroded b Which side to believe  How about consumers  safety in all of this b i Ford Motor Co CEO fires back    We are deeply disappointed that Firestone decided not work together for the safety of our shared customers  which is the only issue that matters  Despite all the shots fired back and forth  consumers become spectators of this major disagreement  They are taking lessons  They want to know which side is truly interested in protecting them  giving them the assurance of safety on the roads  After all  they are the ones who buy the various Ford Explorers on which the Firestone tires were mounted  Jacques Nasser decides to recall close to 13 million more Firestone tires on its SUVs  It has already made plans to replace the Firestone Wilderness AT tires by signing a contract with Goodyear  All of this news leaves John Lampe with no other alternatives other than to ask for an inquiry of the Ford Explorer  This news is nothing but positive for the consumers and the plaintiffs of various lawsuits  If anything wrong is found in the Ford Explorer design  they will be able to use this new information against Ford  On the other hand  Ford CEO Jacques Nasser wants to continue believing that all the problems lie with the tire manufacturer   John Lampe does not understand why his company s tires fair well in other vehicles  but not on Ford Explorer  He admits that this company is prone to rollovers  This may explain why he is asking for an inquiry  He has taken steps making sure the proceedings get under way i  At that point  Mr  Lampe met with transportation secretary Norman Mineta and submitted to him a pretty long report about Ford Explorer s steering problem that may have contributed to rollovers Ford is blaming on defective tires   For sure  the battle has intensified  Still  the questions that most consumers are asking are  How safe is the Explorer  How safe are the tires b What has been known in this conflict  a  The federal government has files linking Bridgestone Firestone to 174 deaths and more than 700 injuries  Based on these data  it appears that Firestone had no other games to play other than to be forthcoming and cooperative to save its skin  We all know how last Summer  Bridgestone Firestone agreed to recall 6 5 million tires that the government linked to the previous deaths b  Ford has a lot of ammunition against Firestone  And Firestone has a lot against Ford too  So much for the 95 year relationship that saw the marriage of blood and flesh over the years  Plaintiffs of lawsuits filed against both companies are paying close attention to the tidbits of info that fall on their laps  Who would not jump on them c   Important features despite all the rumors   Ford Explorer has been a best seller  It is one of the Ford s lines of vehicles that has had some great returns over the years  Most consumers continue to buy them despite the existence of its competitors as found in GMC Jimmy  Chevrolet Blazer  Jeep Cherokee 2WD and Jeep Cherokee 4WD  The 2001 Ford Explorer comes with air bag driver  air bad passenger  side impact door beams  theft deterrent system  window  driver side Express door etc and all the standard features While this breakup may be a catalyst to many plaintiffs  lawyers  grin  what remains to establish to end all doubt is whether Ford Explorer is all that it s cranked out to be  It will be up to the inquiry team to answer this question  John Lampe can t answer it himself  Let s hope that the truth  the whole truth will come out without any problems  The public  the consumers are watching  They have already paid with the blood of their loved ones  They are suffering while they recover from last year s flurry of peeling tires accidents May the truth come out  This way  if any defect is found in the vehicle  it may be corrected to save lives on the roads  As far as the tires are concerned  let s hope that more whistle blowers come out like Erin Brokovich  It is said that Alan Hogan has been the Erin Brokovich in this case  May he continue to serve society and the regular Joes with his moral values  We need more people like him around  Don t you agree  
Neg, My 1995 Ford Explorer Sport was my favorite vehicle that I ve owned  when it was running  The things that I liked about this SUV is that it is very roomy and handles very well  These are about the only things that I liked  Every month I had a problem with it  everywhere from that cooling system to the transmition  Nothing but problems  Not only was it always broken down but it also was terrible on the gas mileage  The two other cars that I have had for an extended period of time were a Toyota pickup and the car I have now is an Altima  I haven t had a problem with either of these vehicles  notice that they are both foriegn cars  I would not encourage anyone to purchase the 1995 Ford Explorer Sport unless given to you or you have too much money and you want to use it on repairs     
Neg, I have a Ford Explorer Sport and I know I am going to get some flack for writing this epinion but I feel I must voice my epinion anyway  I have read many other epinions about the Ford Explorer and many people seem to love this SUV I however would never ever buy another one The vehicle is very attractive looking roomy quite comfortable and not that bad on gas BUT the construction is extremely poor  My doors  quot dropped quot  because the hinges were made so poorly  The inside door panel and handle construction is so poor that my handles actually broke off just from regular use which in turn caused my inside door panels to crack split and then break altogether When I take the vehicle out of 4 wheel drive I am instructed to back up a bit to totally disengage the hubs  What is that  I don t see other people backing up all over the place to do that  This can t be right but if I don t back up I hear crunching and grinding and I don t dare drive it What a poor system  I was told by the service department that this was normal for the Ford Explorer though and that I need to backup My ABS system doesn t work properly either and I have had times when I wasn t sure I was going to be able to stop for school buses and such  I found this to be a very scary experience Now I get a recall card in the mail saying the rear door  hatch  hinges are poorly constructed and could be dangerous  NO KIDDING I have 4 years left to pay on the piece of junk and wish I had never bought it  If I could get out from underneath it I would in a heartbeat I would not recommend the purchase of and Explorer to anyone and would never consider buying one again I have dubbed mine the Ford Exploder I consider it one of the worst vehicles I have ever owned br br  
Neg, In March  1999 I decided to buy a Ford Explorer Sport after thoroughly researching information on suv s in my price range  For the first month I truly enjoyed my new car  I like the power it has but not the gas it uses but I knew it wouldn t get good gas mileage and I was okay with that  But what I hate about this vehicle is how many recalls it has had already  among the other problems I ve had with it  One month after I bought the vehicle the back window shattered out while it was sitting in the carport  When the dealer fixed it they in turn screwed up the back wiper so I had to take it back in  I m glad I wasn t driving at the time  Then I got the recall for the secondary hood latch  then a recall for the cruise control  then a recall for the windshield wiper blades  because they would swish back and forth when you used the turn signal and sometimes even when you didn t use the turn signal  Last week I had to take the vehicle in because it s running rough  It sputters then very quickly accelerates when taking off from a stop or backing up and the transmission feels like it s slipping  When I picked up the vehicle I had to go to the service person and ask them to explain the receipt  He told me that the problem could not be fixed as it is under investigation by Ford  They don t know what s causing the problem and until they do they don t know how to repair it  Once they figure it out they will be sending out  another  recall  That means I have to drive this vehicle with it running the way it is until then  It s embarrassing to be in this V6 SOHC vehicle and have it sputter so bad you can hardly back out of a parking space  then have it catch and fly out of that space I don t think anyone should buy this vehicle     
Neg, Pros  Looks nice when it s clean  Reliable so far  Sits up high like most SUVs  It s not too big nor too small  Priced fairly Cons  Poor gas mileage  18 MPG around town   20 MPG highway  The biggest single negative feature is the child restraints or lack of adequate restraints in the rear seats  Child seats tip going around corners  I have advised Ford of this problem and they have not seen fit to warn potential buyers I purchased this vehicle because it looked nice and I ve never owned an SUV  I haven t seen many Ford Explorer Sports on the road so far  probably because of the Firestone tire recall that was all over the news some weeks ago  I m told that Firestone tires on this vehicle are not affected by the recall because they are 16 inch tires EXTERIOR  8 I purchased a black SUV and it looks beautiful when clean and shiny  Unfortunately most black vehicles need a considerable amount of care  The design is just right for my taste  it s not too large  like some SUVs  but it does take some getting use to judging distances when parking  The middle windows have a slight tint and the rear windows have a darker tint  The rear window is dark enough so I don t have to change my inside rear view mirror at night INTERIOR  6 I give the interior a 6 primarily because of the potentially dangerous child car seat restraints are none existent  My two and three year old grandchildren were tipping back and forth going slow around turns  The rear seating is for two people  only  Seatbelts exist only for two people and no more  If I d noticed this when I was considering the purchase  I would not have bought the vehicle The interior color is grey with a synthetic leather which appears to wear on the drivers side very fast for only six months of use  ENGINE  8 The V6 appears to have adequate power  As mentioned earlier  my only difficulty comes with the poor fuel economy  Sorry  but there s no good excuse for poor gas mileage this day and age RIDE  6 The Ford Explorer Sport is a truck of sorts and rides like one  Obvioulsy not as smooth as a passenger car but I would have no problem taking this vehicle off road before I d take other passenger car  You will feel most small pot holes and cracks in the road HANDLING  7 Highway driving concerns me the most  I m very careful not to make any sudden steering control turns because I feel this vehicle will turn over like many SUVs have to date  This is probably do to the higher than normal center of gravity  The 4 wheel drive worked well during a recent snow storm  The brakes are beginning to grab and make noises already RELIABILITY  9 So far this SUV has been reliable  probably because I paid a considerably fee for extra protection at the dealership  Like anything else  I ll get very concerned when the extended warranty expires  Car are very expensive to repair VALUE  6 Considering the price  it s a fair value  not great  just fair EXTRA FEATURES  7 I purchased a model with a 6 CD Pioneer Changer in the dash  The CD works great THE VERDICT  I would not consider another Ford Explorer SPORT for my next purchase  There has to be much better products out there for a better price AVERAGE SCORE  7 125 out of 10 Comfort  Ok except on bumpy roads Quality  Little noise  but not too bad Roominess  Adequate Handling  amp  Control  Good Condition  New Model Year  2001 Model and options  Satisfactory Recommend to friends or family  NO    
Neg, In August of 1997 I  Russell  turned the age of 16  My parents told me I could have any car that was available to my choices on the lot  no special oredering my dad said  So as a 16 year old getting his first car  a new one at that  I was very estatic to look at my options  I knew that I either wanted a mustang or an explorer  Well my decision was made  The explorer was mine  After about 3 months of having my SUV  my check engine light decided to come on  As soon as that happend no more than 2 hours later i took it to the dealership and it took them 2 weeks to fix it  It needed a tune up already  Well in mid March my Mach 460 radio system  factory  blew  The dealership did not want to fix this saying that it was my fault  And needless to say my sunroof stopped working  my leather seats started to tear  and keep in mind  I kept very good care of this car  VERY GOOD  she was my baby  I do not think i liked anything about this car after having it for a year and a half  Driving this car was an unbelievalbe experience  Everybody where I live wanted to drive it  It was easy on the handling  very aggresive  and super fast  If you think that this was just a lemon then buy one  on my opinion i have 3 other friends that just have gotten new ones in the past year and they have done the same  I would not recomend this vehicle to my worst enemy  Now however Ford has come out with the Ford Explorer Sport Trac  this car is better by far  I have had mine for about 3 months now and she has gave me NO problems at all  I recommend the Ford Explorer Sport Trac  NOT the Ford Explorer Sport br br  
Neg, My experience thus far with Ford and my Ford Explorer Sport has been subpar  Reviewing an automobile  I d like to take the more Consumer Reports approach  and just list the good things and the bad things I ve experienced since January 2000  Good  1  My dealer was fast  and gave us what we wanted quickly  2  We got a surprise delivery of two very nice  folding director s chairs with the  quot Ford Outfitters quot  logo that we use regularly  It was a nice touch  especially with them not even telling us about the gift  3  It s a comfortable car with effective air conditioning and practical seating  The fold down rear seats are a very smart design  Ok  the bad  1  It was a bit overpriced for what I got  I ve driven a Jeep Cherokee before this  with the old body style  and it was much cheaper and practical  2  The gas mileage is totally horrendous  I have yet to obtain the average mileage advertised on the window summary at the dealer  Very bad times to be driving gas guzzlers  Again  something the Cherokee was much more efficient in  3  Ford Credit has been very crooked  We specifically asked not to receive their special warranty  but the creditors charged us anyway  and when we asked for a refund  they simply applied the 1800 dollars toward the END of our loan  And they have not cooperated or tried to undo the situation since  So  we are in effect paying interest on an 1800 dollar warranty we asked not to have  That was a major downer  4  The stereo sucks  5  The suspension sucks  6  It s value has already depreciated significantly from the time of purchase  and we are already after 5 months well into negative equity It s my first Ford  And probably my last for a long time     
Neg, I bought my first new car in 1994  After many test drives of other SUV s I chose a brand new Ford Explorer Sport  I had it custom made and bought an extended warranty 75 000 miles or 4 years  After a year I started to have problems  I can t remember all the problems  mostly brakes  Every time I brought it in I had to pay a  50 dollar deductible  even though I had a warranty  It was always something I brought my vehicle to a reputable garage in town every 3 000 miles to have the oil changed and I went by the book with all the maintenance that was needed   Ford gave me a book with maintenance checklists  I never failed to miss a 3 000 mile maintenance  I even had the tires rotated when I brought the vehicle in for a oil change  I had the book checked and signed by the mechanic before I left  I never beat on the vehicle or drove it recklessly  I was at 78 000 in August 1997  I was in town and the vehicle died  It was the transmission  I had to have it towed to a local transmission garage  They told me it would cost at least  1 000 to just get it going  not including anything else to do it right  I called Ford and they wouldn t even listen to me  They didn t care that I had proof that I properly maintained my vehicle because a Ford mechanic didn t do the maintenance  They said my Warranty expired 3 000 miles ago  nothing we can do  I had just paid off the vehicle 3 months before and I was stuck with a piece of junk  I also have to say my tires lasted longer than the transmission   I just replaced the tires for the first time a few weeks before  No one at Ford cared or would listen to me  I told the transmission mechanic to fix it quick to get it going  It cost me  1 000 to get rid of it  I traded it in for a Honda Civic and haven t had one problem with it in two years and my warranty has no deductible  I am currently looking for another SUV  My employer is currently advertising any Ford vehicle for purchase over 4  dealer invoice  Even with this incentive I will never purchase another Ford again  I can only recommend this vehicle if you have the money for all of the repairs or you buy an extended warranty without a deductible and trade it in before your warranty expires br br  
Neg, Most car manufacturers have a line of cars that are highly profitable because they have not had to change them in years  A few cosmetic upgrades here and there  and the vehicle is launched as a new model year The Explorer has been around for over a decade and the 2001 Explorer Sport is the most modern interpretation of this old platform  New grill  body cladding and white gauges can t hide a rigid rear suspension  poor gas mileage and some old demons such as poor build quality b Engine  The dealer told me that the 4 0 V6 in the Explorer was the German built powerplant designed to lower emission levels  Very smooth but very thirsty b Transmission  Mated to this German powerplant was this new French transmission  After 2 months  this transmission failed and had to be replaced  This left the car at the dealership for almost two weeks  The flip side of this was that I had a nice little Focus to drive b Interior  Wonderful seats and a nice update to the standard Explorer interior including white gauges and faux brushed metal door handles  Every piece seemed to be made from quality materials  However  in the 2 door Sport model  the front passenger seat was difficult to slide back to allow access to the rear seats  Very strange given the wonderful 2 door mechanism there was in a Ford Probe I used to have   the front passenger seat would slide out of the way  This would have been a nice feature in the Explorer Sport Nice touches include the puddle lamps off the mirrors b Problem areas  Rear fixed window leaked and had to be rebeaded and replaced  Rear windshield wiper motor failed  Matte finish of the front door arm rests wore off in just 3 months  Ancient rear suspension meant very bad handling in parking lots over bumps  As mentioned above  the transmission failed right in the middle of traffic and it took almost 2 weeks to have it replaced  The transmission problem lead to major arguments with the dealer  Ford Customer Relations and the service manager b Dealer support  Um  non existent  The problem areas had to be escalated to Ford Customer Relations to resolve  Because the Explorer Sport ended up being serviced for over 30 days  I qualified for the California Lemon Law and I eventually moved to a Ford Escape  The dealer experience was so bad that this will be my last Ford since I ve been driving Fords in 1985  
Neg, You may think that a new design will improve the previous design not necessary with 2001 Explorer  The only change is the head and tail light I went to the dealer with a very positive attitude to test drive the new Explorer  Was I impressed when I left  not at all  the same opinion as last model The ride is very bumpy  it feels like sitting on wood  The engine sounds like a tractor trailer and cornering is a disaster  I felt very unsafe driving without the seat belt because I was sliding all over the place Front seats are so so  but rear seats are very uncomfortable  You ll think that after all the complaints that people made about seat comfort that Ford will make some improvement  but unfortunatlly they did not and 2001 model is the same as previous except for little minor changes Ford Explorer does not have the car like ride as Nissan Pathfinder  Toyota 4Runner or Grand cherokee  It has very rough bumpy ride Does it really worth  30 000  please think again br br  
Neg, I always wanted a truck  especially after owning a little ol  station wagon for many years  I wanted to go big  but could only afford small  and ended up with a 90 Ford Ranger 4x4 XLT  At the time of purchase  and for the next few years  it was the greatest truck in the world  Got me where I needed to go  and took everything else with it  The extended cab was perfect to toss bags or anything else in  and also housed a little bazooka tube for some extra thump when I wanted to turn the music up The V6 Engine gave me a nice ride  though it was a bit underpowered  compared to what I drive now  And it turned out to be this engine that would cause me all the pain and suffering in the world a truck can cause you  It started innocently enough when my car suddenly overheated and stopped in the middle of the freeway one day  Pushing my car into the Temsco  I was told it was simply a leak in the radiator fluid line  which it was  and I was told they d fixed it  which they hadn t  So the next day  I drive from Southern Oregon to Seattle  a good 600 mile trip  Truck drives fine  though the whole way  I m scared out of my gord it s gonna die again  and alas  10 miles from my final destination  it does  This times its a wee bit worse than before  one of the heads has cracked  and will need to be replaced  This is done  and after a few hundred bucks down the drain  I come to find out not only one head is cracked  but BOTH heads were cracked  and the other would need to be replaced  More money  both heads fixed  phew  Except now my engine is loud with a constant ticking noise that just won t stop  And for the next few years  it kept it up  never could get fixed  until the truck was traded in for a Toyota Camry  It was really one bad problem that made driving the truck a chore and kept me from being happy to own it  and with the other problems I ve seen Ford drivers have  I don t think you ll see me behind a Ford wheel ever again br br  
Neg, Wednesday night  who goes out on a Wednesday night  There s this reggae party that happens at one of the beach front hotels in my area  Kind of a tradition for the locals  but I haven t been to it since 1995  Well  a bunch of my fianc s co workers talked him into going with them and of course  he wanted me to come  Because I usually don t get off work until 6PM ish  I knew we d have to leave as soon as I got home  Wow  almost 7 years and it hasn t changed much  Because it s a beach party that involves cheap alcohol  it can be pretty amusing  But something about sitting outside when it s like 800 degrees and the food selection is limited to picked though chicken wings  ripe cheese squares and crackers doesn t really make me want to drink  But some of the people are interesting to look at  like that little hippie looking guy with a camel toe and a belt buckle bigger than his head  Or how about that screaming lady who forgot a bra that the bouncers are escorting out  Hmm  have another beer  I m glad I didn t drink  because my fianc  friends did  What s scary is one of them owns a 2003 Expedition and felt he could drive it home  In short  I got to drive a 2003 Expedition  The Expedition  introduced as a 1997 model  is the 2nd flagship to Ford s high profit SUV line that lead Ford to introduce the Excursion  which is still struggling  So much so that Ford had to cut manufacturing in half about a year and a half ago  Like GM  Ford has a large selection in SUVs and SUV like trucks  But in a market flooded with costly SUVs constantly being shoved down consumers throats  consumers are now starting to choke on the high gas prices and cost of ownership  The success of the 2003 Expedition is very important for Ford and their recovery after last years 5 45 billion dollar profit loss  proving that not all consumers need 5500  lb  gas guzzlers  that is  unless you re a soccer mom  It looks like SUVs have taken over the reputation the minivan once had  One of the main selling points for the redesigned Expedition is it handles much better off road and is not as  soft  and GM s Tahoe Yukon line  I wanted to find out who the Expedition is really targeted to and how much it really improved over its predecessor B I Exterior   At first glance  I mistook it for the 2002 Explorer  the Expedition looks very identical to it with the same front grill  headlights  bumper trims and overall body shape  Maybe this helped Ford save money on the redesign  I m wondering why they look so identical when the previous models of the Explorer and Expedition looked nothing alike  I think some consumers are still weary about the Explorer after the whole Firestone mess  so maybe this wasn t a smart design move  The Expedition is 205 8 inches or 17 15 feet long  78 7 inches or 6 5 feet wide  77 6 or 6 46 feet tall  It has a ground clearance of 8 9 inches and weighs in somewhere around 5 600 lbs  depending on the engine and if it s 2WD or 4WD  Color options for the Eddie Bauer Edition include white  dark green  black  light green  red and dark blue  There is no silver option yet and I prefer silver  but that s just me  But  you d think it would be an option because it s a basic color  Color options for the XLT model include a plain beige  tan  dark green  black  dark gray  light green  red  blue  while  silver and light blue  All are plain  everyday colors  but I suppose it would look a little funny in bright yellow  aqua or even the iridescent blue Honda offers  But I would still like to see some metallic orange tones and maybe a dark plum purple b CON b  Overall  the looks are bland  lacking the ability to turn heads  but clean  The Expedition does sport a lot of black plastic on the exterior  like many new SUV Trucks  depending on what trim options you get  I m not really fond of that because it s a maintenance pain  requiring regular polishing so it does not turn white in the sun  I used to gripe about polishing the front and back bumpers on my old Tercel  it took a lot of elbow grease get the plastic to absorb the polish and it was time consuming  The Expedition has a lot more plastic than my old Tercel  I recommend getting it professionally detailed every 6 months to keep up the plastic  but that can cost around  200 for a vehicle that size each time    Interior   It s hard to say what people like in interiors  everyone seems to want something different  Some look for leather  polished wood and a dial clock  I ve never figured that out  while others may want a unique layout with cool upholstery design  colored gauges and lots of light up goodies  But I think most want the interior to feel like a home away from home  whether it s conservative or bold  But it s not quite as easy to customize your car interior as it is your home  I think Ford tried to please everyone with the Expeditions interior  but did it with as little statement as possible and no real  boldness  and seemingly sucking the  sport  out of sport utility vehicle  I say this because it s a little on the bland side  according to Ford s site and the one I drove  there is only one color option for the interior  so far  It s tan  or light beige  with a tan and black plastic like dashboard  Because the dash is so big  there is a lot of negative space on it with no controls or vents  making it seem like an ocean of plastic  I would prefer more storage cubbies instead of wasted space  There s a large gap between the climate control panel and the stereo of just black plastic  The steering wheel is beige  but the background is black creating a strange mismatched feeling  The power controls are located on the door armrest area and were easy to reach  but did not get in the way  The captains chair for the drivers seat is nice  offering an armrest on either side  The leather is comfortable  but gets very hot in the sun  may want to consider a seat cover for the summer  The gauges are standard black background with back light  Again  this is bland  old styling  It would be nice if they used a white background instead  like the Escape or even get a little crazy with the new metallic tones  such as the Matrix Vibe duo  The climate control vents are large and round and the AC seems to cool down the cabin fairly quick considering the size  Both the 2nd and 3rd row of seats fold down  creating 110 cubic feet of storage    CON b  But  the seats only fold down  they can t come out  so they re still there taking up space  Most minivans have an advantage in that aspect because both rows of seats can be removed creating more storage space  The storage space isn t bad  but not good compared to many minivans  The Toyota Sienna has 133 4 cubic feet  the Honda Odyssey has 146 1 cubic feet and finally the Kia Sedona has 127 5 cubic feet of storage with the seats removed  all more than the large Expedition  The Expedition only has 20 7 cubic feet of storage behind the 3rd row of seats  while the Sienna has 26 6 cubic feet  the Odyssey has 38 1 cubic feet and the Sedona has 21 8 cubic feet  again susprisingly more than the Expedition For head room  the Expedition has 39 7 inches of headroom for the front row  39 8 inches for the 2nd row and 38 2 for the 3rd  while the Honda Odyssey has more with 41 2 inches for the first row  40 0 for the 2nd and 38 9 for the 3rd  In fact  even the new small to mid sized Honda Pilot SUV has more head room than the Expedition at 41 9 inches for the 1st row  40 9 inches for the 2nd row and 38 9 inches for the 3rd  If you re interested in the Expedition for space and cargo capacity  looks like a minivan would be the better choice An optional feature is the 3rd row of seats can powered down by using switch in the back reached when the back is opened up  I m not sure that s really helpful and I wonder how that can go wrong in the future  I would rather the seats be removable to open more space  than powered down B I Engines   There are two V8 engine options for the 2003 Expedition  The first is the standard SOHC 2 Valve  4 6 liter V8 with 232 hp and 291 lbs  of torque at 3 450 rpm  Though it sounds powerful  sadly  it does not seem to carry the Expedition s weight well  The Chevy Avalanche comes with a 285 hp engine that gets about the same gas mileage as this engine and it didn t seem much better  Depending on 4WD  the gas mileage on this model varies from 14 19 to 14 18  However  you may not get this mileage right away  I have read from other Ford owners that there seems to be a break in time of lower gas mileage for the first few months The 2nd engine is the optional SOHC 2 Valve  5 4 liter V8 with 260 hp and 350 lbs  of torque at 2 500 rpm  This is an improvement  but the gas mileage is between 13 18 to 13 17 depending on 4WD  This engine can tow up to 8 900 lbs  The gas tank capacity is 28 gallons  giving you 394 miles to 532 miles to a tank  depending on engine type and city of highway driving and can cost between  45 to  60 or more to fill up the tank  depending on gas prices in your area b CON b  The gas mileage is a major gripe about the Expedition  no improvements here  I realize something of this size needs power  but it s insulting when a V6 minivan that gets about 25 MPG can hold as much or more than the 2003 Expedition  About 3 years ago  Ford was making noises about a hybrid 200 hp V6 engine that gets around 40 MPG and possibly a V8 version with the new hybrid technology  When it was first mentioned in 2000  I think  the targeted release date was in 2003  But that seems to have faded  possibly due to profit loss  But if Ford can produce a mainstream SUV with a hybrid engine  I think it would give them the market edge they need to recover the lost profit and change the standards for SUVs  But  I guess that technology is beyond Ford at this point and we ll have to leave it to the Japanese to introduce the first US hybrid SUV  Ford can comply with car standards and have the new Expedition can achieve mileage of 17 22 or higher  but Ford choose to keep the Expedition in the old  utility  class  where the gas mileage requirements are lower  they save money on manufacturing and the consumer pays more for gas  Most consumers buying this model will not be using it for utility  but more as a minivan commuter car  In that aspect  someone needs to tell Ford we re moving forward not backwards in technology B I Handling   Handling is one of the major improvements in the next generation Expedition and I will say it s quite an improvement  Road noise and wind shear seem to be non existent  It s a quiet ride  unless you have the stereo cranked  But it was almost too quiet  I found myself getting sleepy  maybe boredom played a role in this as well The power steering was very easy and somewhat responsive and the brakes seem to work well  But don t take that for granted  something of this size and weight has a lot longer stopping distance than a car  I don t recommend tailgating anybody in this because you may not have enough time to stop if they slam on the brakes  The overall handling was a little mushy because it felt like the body was reluctant to turn with the wheel  making tight turns a challenge  It has independent front and rear suspension  While I did not get to take it off roading  I would imagine it would do well B I Standard Features   b PROS b  Standard features include Keyless entry pad and remote keyless entry  4 wheel disc brakes with ABS  child safety seat anchors  dual front airbags  leather seats  Eddie Bauer  power steering  low profile roof rack  17  wheels  40 60 bench seats in the first row  XLT only  captains chairs standard on Eddie Bauer  3rd row bench seats  tilt steering column  cruise control  CD cassette stereo  power windows  power locks and dome light B I Optional Features   An optional feature that proves the Expeditions minivan likeness is DVD rear seat entertainment center  It offers 7  screen that folds down from the ceiling and a control panel with headphone jacks  A interesting feature  but I m sure parents will agree that if this kind of entertainment is needed  a Gameboy or two is much cheaper and portable Other optional features include Safe canopy system  tire pressure sensing  power fold down 3rd seat  climate controlled front seats  Eddie Bauer only  4WD  2nd row captains chairs  power fold 3rd row seats  front hooks with 4WD only and moonroof B I Safety   One safety concern about SUVs  minivans and any vehicle with open storage area in the cabin is in the event of a bad accident  any large items in the cabin  such as a cooler  groceries  supplies for a beach trip or a sheet of wood  can hit passengers and cause injuries or worse  So if your in the habit of driving with a lot of stuff in the car all the time  you may want to rethink that or look into putting some kind of wall or separating barrier between it and the cabin that s strong and will not come loose easily  One thing mentioned in the ads is a Safe Canopy System with roll over sensor  What the heck is that  Well  it s an optional safety feature that s basically a wall of side airbags lining the 1st and 2nd row of seats  The roll over sensor allows the airbags to stay inflated it the vehicle is rolling and will deflate when it stops rolling  I can t decide if this is comforting or scary with all the roll over controversy around SUVs  but I did chuckle a little at the irony  if I were a better comedian  I could base a whole routine of this alone    CON b  This system does not cover the 3rd row of seats  kind of cheesy  If you re going to advertise such a complex safety system for a so called large family vehicle  make sure it protects all passengers  The 2002 model did very well in the government crash test ratings  however  the close relative  the F 150 did horribly in the IIHS tests  Because this is so new  it s too soon to get crash test ratings on it  I would assume Ford would only improve from the 2002 model    Warranty   The 2003 Expedition has a 3 year  36 000 mile bumper to bumper warranty  5 year  50 000 warranty on the safety restraint system and a 5 year 100 000 mile power train warranty B I Resale   Like a minivan  I think most people buy a vehicle like this hoping they won t have to drive it for a long time  maybe just until the kids grow up or until the boat phase is over  Mainly because it s expensive  uses a lot of gas  is a pain to wash and not the most exciting thing to drive  So it s important that a vehicle of this price range holds a high resale value  Being a new  redesigned model  that can be a gamble  especially with possible gas problems in the future  I recommend taking a look at reviews of older Expeditions from owners and look at what used Expeditions are selling for  You can check listings nationally at http www cars com    Parting Shots   Despite the changes and improvements  the 2003 Expedition does not stand out from the competition  but comes across as another  run of the mill SUV  The looks are nothing to get excited about  power is mediocre  while gas mileage is poor and space seating capacity are average  While it does have a promise of improved safety and improvements in handling and suspension for off roading uses  the  32 000 to  42 000 price tag and yuppie soccer mom feel may not appeal to the class that will go off roading  Overall  the 2003 Expedition is a nice vehicle  in terms of some what luxury with refined off road handling  But I did not find it  fun  to drive  When I say fun  I mean something that handles with a little spirit  is easy to drive and park  and a little different  unique in some aspects from other vehicles in it s class  Like the looks of the Toyota Matrix Pontiac Vibe  or the above average power and gas efficiency of the Nissan Sentra Spec V  or even the new hybrid technology and looks of the Toyota Prius  But I did not find any of these qualities in the 2003 Expedition  I like something I can look forward to driving every morning  but I think I would look forward to the Expedition about as much as I would to a bowl of bran cereal with skim milk  There is nothing  special  about it and I can see where it can be classified with the  tan minivan  in terms of excitement  Even though it has more luxury qualities  it by no means has the reputation or demands the attention that one would get driving a luxury sedan  such as a Lexus or an Acura that I think luxury buyers are looking for  Nor is it as fun to drive because it s more sluggish and the handling is mushy  I don t think luxury buyers want to be mistaken for a dreaded soccer mom  even if they are taking their kids to soccer practice  It gets a 2 star rating As stated in my Avalanche review  my major complaint goes something like this  The newest Expedition is another Ford contribution to the SUV Truck power craze that has brought dreams of big bucks to the big Detroit three and I must say I m not impressed  As an answer to the now outdated SUV craze  we are starting to see a lot of these over powered utility vehicles that are being shoved down consumers throats with high price tags through extreme advertising  The problem  By using loopholes in the emissions standards  American and other auto manufacturers make more profit by selling vehicles  such as SUVs and SUV like trucks  classified as  utility  vehicles  designed for utility  not for commuting or everyday uses  Problem is they re being advertised and sold as everyday use cars  The Reason  Selling a utility vehicle is cheaper for a manufacturer is because there is 33  mileage and emission standards required  However  consumers are the ones reamed with the extra fuel costs  but the manufacturers are saving money and that s what s important  right  These loopholes have allowed American manufacturers to become dependant on the profit from selling more utility vehicles than cars  A good example of this is Ford s latest advertising campaign with Bill Ford talking  I ve only seen two versions of these commercials  for trucks and for SUVs  just their  utility  vehicles  Not for efficient family sedans or compact cars  because Ford does not make a lot of profit on those  I wouldn t have a problem with large trucks and large SUVs if they had more efficient engines and better safety ratings  It just seems that the consumers and the environment are the losers in this greedy game of profit  Pardon my instantaneous rage  I just read a disturbing article on how America s gas consumption and emissions pollution has nearly tripled since 1985 because of the SUV boom and what the government is not doing about it  I like American vehicles as much as the next American  but it seems that the Detroit three are shooting themselves in the foot by manufacturing all these trucks and SUVs we don t need with old standards when gas prices are going up  the environment is becoming more of a concern and there is a big oil controversy on whether or not to drill in Alaska  If the standards were tighter and they did not use the loopholes to manufacturer  America would never need to drill in Alaska and gas prices would probably be cheaper now  Agree  Don t agree  The comment section is open  6 25 02   I came across this article that s rather disturbing today http www thecarconnection com index asp article 5020 Other vehicles to consider Honda Odyssey   Has more styling looks  more versatile space  better gas mileage  great crash test ratings  will seat 7  is cheaper and can even tow up to 3 500 lbs Ford Focus Wagon   Has lots of cargo space  head room  good looks  good gas mileage  American brand  is cheaper and comfortably seats 5 Honda Pilot   Cheaper  smaller  better gas mileage  seats 8  tows up to 4 500 lbs  and has more head room Thanks for reading  
Neg, After owning a 1999 Expedition XLT for 2 years and being very pleased with it in every aspect  I expected the same from the 2003 Expedition  Exterior looks great  except for being a follower of the new Explorer  but I have nothing against that  I particularly loved the new interior design  The third row seating is a vast improvement in the new Expedition  I did not have the power fold option for the third row  which is not a problem when letting the seat down  but getting it back up is a little tricky  I was pleased with the performance of the 5 4V8L and the independent rear suspension  The handling of the truck was much better than the old model  The wider mirrors were great just watch what you re doing when pulling into the garage But on to other things  my truck had a constant rattle coming from both the driver and passenger side doors  This absolutely drove me crazy  I took the truck to the shop 4 times for repair  with no success  The dealer called in a Senior Engineer from Ford  but he never determined exactly what the cause was  So at that point  I was extremely disappointed with the workmanship of the truck  I hated getting into it each morning knowing I had to listen to the rattle for the 45 minute drive to work  We tried to get Ford to buy the truck back  but we got the run around  They told us that it was a problem with the new design and they were going to develop a solution  but as of right then they didn t have one  To me  it seems they were telling us just to  DEAL WITH IT  We have a really bad feeling about Ford and the new Expedition  I really liked the truck and thought I would never go back to a car or smaller SUV  but I did  I now own a Jeep Grand Cherokee  I didn t think I could love a vehicle as much as I love my Cherokee  
Neg, My daughter recently took over control of the Family 99 Explorer  Plus I just dumped our van  With this  I decided that maybe my 3 seat explorer wasn t quite as big as I once thought  So  I am shopping for a Full size SUV  I hate mini vans  Besides  I need 5 cars like a hole in the head First Impression God this thing is huge  It looks a lot bigger than a Tahoe  but in reality  its about the same size  I liked the choice of exterior color  although a rust color would look great  I did not like the major use of plastic  It gave it a cheap look Drive train The 4wd unit I drove had the 5 4 V 8  Plenty of power  The gas gauge was at a quarter of a tank when I started the test drive and was dead on E when I returned  I only drove 25 miles I did not like its handling very much either  It leaned a lot and seemed bothered by large cross winds  Plus this one had an annoying rattle in the roof  Also  it rode like a buck board  My bum was very stiff  Interior I liked the seats and I like how the dashboard was laid out  But that is about all I liked  It was just plastic and some faux leather stuff  Plus I thought the DVD system took up to much room  I did not stay in more than thirty minuets  and that is about all I could stand  Durability If the rattle was any indication  it probably won t last very long  
Neg, Ok  let me start by saying  I really enjoy driving this car  It s low  fairly spunky  handles very well  and looks great  The front seats are comfortable  although a bit difficult to climb in and out of  The back seat is very small and not comfortable to ride in  but I generally don t need room for more than 2 so this isn t a problem for me  The trunk or hatch is pretty roomy  and can be expanded by lowering the back seats Well  now for the downside  I bought this car in July of 1999 for just under book value  I checked the title history and it had never been wrecked  Since the time of purchase I have spent several thousand on repairs  My first problem was the alternator  After 2 days in the shop and a  200 bill  I had it back and working fine  Next came the ignition system  requiring the distributor to be replaced for over  600  The next inspection required back brake calipers for around  300  My most recent problem is a bad headlight motor which sells for  400  Anyway  these are just the major repairs  Add this onto a new set of tires  a timing belt  oil changes  and other general maintenance  insurance  and well  you do the math  All of this happened in under 12 months of driving I have really enjoyed driving this car when it was working properly  It just hasn t done well at all for me  Since purchasing this thing  I ve been in contact with several other  93  amp   94 Probe GT owners with a similar story  Taking all this into consideration  I obviously can not recommend this vehicle Oh  by the way  mine is for sale if you re looking for one br br  
Neg, I bought this vehicle used in 1997  It had only 42 000 miles on it  a modest amount for Los Angeles  and looked to be in great shape  The previous owner certainly kept up the aesthetic quality of the car  So I test drove the car and after doing a little research decided to buy it Well the problems started soon after that  The first major repair was when there was short in the electrical components of the car s overdrive  It would cause the car s RPMs to ramp up in spurts  So I took it in and they had a hard time even finding the problem and then fixing it  several days in the shop and several hundred dollars later I got it back Then I was driving home from work one day and a spark plug popped out of the engine block  I know it sound implausible but it happened  that required new wires  The exhaust pipe broke at a seam in the middle  that had to be soldered  It was leaking tranny fluid from the pan  All sorts of things that add up to a few hundred dollars And then the biggie  a complete valve job and replacement of the O2 sensor  It was leaking oil into the area of the spark plugs  I found out that this is a COMMON problem of these  93 Probes  That was  1400 and six days in the shop And then there are the minor things  like the inner door panel on the driver side coming off  The power window switch falling off  the power attenae being power less  The window fluid sprayer is basically not working  There are a few noticeable rattles  So this car  at least for me has been nothing but a headache as well as a financial drain  When it is operating  it is fun car to drive  I love the look of it  and it certainly has some spunk with it s V6  although I wish it accelerated a bit better  There is ample room in the trunk  but equally  quot un quot ample room in the rear seats for passengers  The driver side seat doesn t really go back as far as I would like  I would suspect for someone taller then me  5  10 quot  it would be a problem  But the seats themselves are quite comfortable  It corners on a manhole cover  i e  very wide  But it drives very comfortably  especially if you like a fairly stiff ride I bought the car because I liked how it drove and looked  My understanding is that the  93 and  94 models have a lot of problems  93 was the first year of their redesign  which may explain a lot of the problems  If you like the look and you like it when you test drive then if my experience is indicitive  then perhaps you need to look at a  95 or later br br  
Neg, I bought my 93 Ford Probe GT used in 1998 from a Jeep dealer  STUPID  I test drove the car and liked it because of the way it looked   it was sporty and fun to drive  It only had 48 000 miles on it  with a purchase price of  9 995  which I now know was about  9 900 too much  When we bought the car  there was a couple of cosmetic things that needed fixed  i e  passenger side door panel falling off  etc  These were fixed within a few weeks  About 6 months into our ownership  some other not so cosmetic problems started happening   brakes grinding loudly  muffler not muffling  normal wear and tear  but things that should have been checked before the dealership sold the car  We took the car in and 2 days later  these simple things were fixed In October of 1999  approx  18 months after purchase  came the motherlode  The Probe overheated one morning when I got to work  I shut the car off and fluids started draining from what seemed like everywhere under the hood  The dealer I bought the car from came to my location and picked up the car  After they looked at it  they assessed that the water pump had gone out  the oil pan gasket was leaking and it basically needed a valve job  Thank GOD for extended warranty  I was without my car for approximately 1 1 2 weeks  Total cost for that job was around  1500  Then when I got the car back  the  quot Check Engine quot  light was on  I called the dealership back and asked why the light was now coming on  when it was not before  They looked at the car again  and found  they thought  that the Mass Airflow Sensor was bad  226  They replaced it  but it did not fix the problem  Then they thought the O2 sensor was bad  another  200 some    replaced it  to no avail  Finally they told me after another week  that they thought the EGR valve had gone bad  but that it would not be covered under warranty  310 for the part alone  I explained to them that even though they considered this a  quot wear and tear quot  part  I should not have to pay for it  We went back and forth  I took the car back and drove it  engine light flashing in my face and all  until I contacted the Better Business Bureau and a local television station  The dealership finally agreed to do the replacement I scheduled my appointment and took the car in  It took them about 3 days to get the part  When they replaced the EGR valve  guess what    it did not fix the problem  Surprise  surprise  So  they cleaned some vacuum lines  etc  still could not find the problem After about a week in the shop  they decided to send it to the Ford dealer down the street and let them look at it  Two and a half weeks later  I get my car back  but only after they put the car on their computer  it told them a part to replace  they replaced it and it didn t fix the problem  Ultimately  I think  it turned out to be a problem with a vacuum pump  or something Now  8 months later  yet another seemingly  quot impossible to figure out quot  problem has surfaced  On July 1  2000  my car quit running  unexplainably  Three different repair shops have looked over the car  trying to determine if it is an electrical problem  which I now understand these cars are notorious for having  or a fuel problem  No one can seem to figure it out  So now  I m back to the Ford dealer on Monday   I wonder if they can pinpoint the problem  I don t have a whole lot of faith I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone  unless you have money to just throw away  and a backup car to drive about every 6 months  for about a month at a time  and if you are just looking for a headache br br  
Neg, I bought this vehicle from a friend in 1999  he made me an offer I couldn t refuse  The car is beautiful  sporty and ahead of its time  Overall  the Probe is a great looking car  The body is very stylish today  even though it was made in 93  it s an eye catcher  There have been no major problems with rust  I love all of the options  ex  power sunroof  power seats  spoiler  alarm  ect  The Probe GT has a lot of power with it s V6 engine  It also handles well in the snow and rain  The front seats are very comfortable and adjust to accommodate your liking  However  the back seats have virtually no legroom and are not designed for the comfort of backseat passengers  The ride is a little stiff and bumpy but generally speaking  it s enjoyable  Unfortunately  I have had a lot of repairs made in the short time I have owned it  All mechanics I have been to say that it is a tough car to work on  Not to mention  every little piece of the 93 GT is expensive to replace  In the 8 months I have owned the car I have had replaced or fixed  All 4 tires  350 Throttle sensor 200 all spark plugs 100 Tune up 200 Muffler system front to back 450  I also had the transmission worked on several times  The mechanics couldn t find the problem until the third time I brought it in to them  Finally  they had taken it to the local Ford dealer and diagnosed it with a short in the transmission as well as being burnt up  The whole system was replaced  Luckily  it was still under warranty from the person who owned it before me  He had paid  1 000 only a few months prior  One problem I have now is that the Rpm s are very jumpy I think this may have something to do with the computer  as 93  GT s are known to have problems with this  I have no washer reservoir for the front windshield because it had cracked  I was told by Ford that the reservoir alone would cost  200  I had the entire sound system replaced  the stock CD player broke only a few weeks after I bought the car and the speakers were already in need of replacement  The problem with this is that the EQ only works with the stock CD player  I had called Ford about replacing the old one with a new stock radio and the cost was  500  In turn  I replaced it with an after market stereo  which disabled my equalizer  but my new system is fantastic  I have a few squeaks and rattles that I probably should have checked out  but with the cost of everything on this car I m afraid to find out  Once I regain some money  I will probably sell my 93 GT   I have a few suggestions for anyone thinking of buying a 1993 Ford Probe GT  Take into consideration the mileage  if it s high don t buy  Find out how many people have owned the car  Don t forget that it s a sports car it may have been be abused  Understand that you most likely will have problems with this car and be prepared to dish out a lot of money  I would look into a different year and or model  Another member of my family owns a first generation Probe 1989  and hasn t had too many problems  even with 160 000K  They are fairly reasonable to fix too     
Neg, I bought this car on December 31 1998  Since I have had nothing but problems  In May of 1999  my transmission let go  This happened at 60 mph on the highway  Transmission specialists rate the Probe as a Specialty car  Therefore  the repair price was inflated 3 000  All the specialists I contacted claimed it was a VERY complicated job  I did find someone to do it for  1 500  The drawback was the Probe ended up being in their shop for a month  Next  the intake manifold gasket let go  Again  I heard SPECIALTY car  Again  I heard complicated to fix  I received a quote of  300   5 for the gasket 295 for the LABOR  I did find a decent mechanic who did the job for  150  I don t know if mechanics in others areas use the word SPECIALTY as an excuse to jack up the price  In my area it seems to be the norm  Ford Probes are known to have electrical problems  So far  mine have been minor just turn signals  Just last week  I got a flat  Of course this happens to any make or model car  The price for tires is higher than average  According to the tire dealer  the tires are specific  SPECIALTY I GUESS  to the car  I have very little faith in the car s dependability  I am just waiting to see what will go wrong next  I bought the PROBE because of her looks  She s a beauty  Therefore  I am NOT surprised by the problems  I had hoped the FORD CO  had paid some attention to mechanical parts  I love the way she drives when in tiptop condition  She s smooth as a baby s butt and purrs like a kitten  Upkeep  of course  will continue to remain a problem  It is fine for folks who have the budget to keep up with it  Money is not the only factor  The inconvenience and the waiting associated with the Probe going in and out of the shop is frustrating  It s a nice little car  but keep the Excedrin handy  When I purchased this car it had 71 000 miles  I have heard the engines last till somewhere around 150 000  All one can do is hope If you re considering purchasing a Probe please keep an eye out for its SPECIALTY problems   TRANSMISSION and ELECTRICAL  I really think it s best suited as a SECOND car br br  
Neg, I can not place this vehicle on my love it or hate it list because both are true  In 1996  my husband and I decided to purchase a new car  He wanted something he could tow things with and keep his tools in  I wanted something with four doors so I would not have to fight with car seats  We searched around our area and came across the perfect medium  It had what we both wanted  We bought this 1992 Ford Explorer  quot Eddie Bower quot Edition SUV  We were both happy with our purchase  We made our purchase in October of 1996  By May of 1997  we had to replace the transmission  I attributed this to my husband going four wheeling in a two wheel drive vehicle  This venture cost us  1900 We shipped the truck to Germany and for three years we prayed that we would not have transmission problems  We did  once  but my husband was able to fix that on his own  We did  however  have problems with the starter  We replaced it several times while in Germany  This ran us  300  each time  We attributed that to the weather in Germany All of this puts us in the year 2000  We return from Germany and embark on a road trip from Pennsylvania to Texas  Our move involved towing a trailer  We were assured by the Ford Dealer and the transmission shop that the transmission would hold up for the trip They were wrong  We made it as far as Odessa  Texas  To be exact  we made it to mile marker 104 on I 10  That is where we were stranded because the transmission blew out  Four days and  1900 later  we have yet another transmission  It is under a 90 day guarantee  We are assured that we will no longer have problems with the transmission Sixty five days later  my husband is on foot because the transmission has gone out AGAIN  We now have to tow the truck over 200 miles to get the transmission replaced under the warranty  Another  342 we have to spend just getting the truck to the destination  Not to mention the money of getting there to get the truck when it is fixed It seems everyone knew about the problems with Ford A Cs another review all together  starters  and transmissions  They just all seemed to forget until after we had all the problems  The above is why I hate the Explorer This is why I love it It is paid for  I have the title for it  It is roomy  I love that it has the 60 40 seats  There is plenty of room for suitcases and tools all at the same time  The car seats all fit comfortably  I have had three bulky car seats in the back at one time Being a short woman  I love the adjustment switches that allow me to be close enough and hight enough to see over the steering wheel  This is funny to my husband because he has to move the seat back before he can even get in the truck  When I am in my Explorer  I feel as big as the other people on the road  I will be upset when we sell the Explorer for the reasons listed above  You can bet that I will look for something larger so I do not feel like a  short  person on the road  I love my Explorer  but I hate that I do not have deep enough pockets to keep it     
Neg, I bought this car new in September  1992 principally because my wife and daughter liked the Forest Green color  SUV s were popular then  and my wife liked the idea of being higher than the rest of the traffic  The truck is somewhat bouncy  and if you are on a rough road  you really feel it  The good thing about the setup is the chair height  Your knees are closer to a ninety degree angle when you ride  and that is a lot easier on your back than a sedan While the body style may be unstable in sharp turns  it sure holds a lot of haulage  I have used it to truck each one of my kids to college  I have found the truck to eat front brake pads  I average around 15k a set  I also think that there are problems with the design of the truck  The catalytic converter is in a place where it heats the transmission  and causes it to fail early  It is also near the front control arm bushing  and heats it so that it fails early  These are expensive repairs  The front suspension needed replacement as well At around 120K  the transmission failed in a catastrophic manner  and it cost around  2 200 00 to replace with a remanufactured unit  My dilemma is this  The truck still looks great  It has around 138k on it at this point  The engine is still tight  However  the AC Delco remanufactured transmission is now starting the same death dance as the old one  Right now  reverse is slow to engage when it is cold  This is how the other transmission started to fail  According to the transmission guy I deal with  this is a common problem with Explorers  He has one  and his transmission does the same thing The truck is still expensive to keep up  It is always needing something like brakes  tie rod ends  exhaust parts and such  I have also detected weeping around the water pump  I don t know whether to sell it now  or keep it for the long haul  This truck is for someone who likes to make a good appearance  and has deep pockets for maintenance  It is not for someone who appreciates fuel economy or low maintenance cost  The 1992 Explorer is an early version  and there are a lot of bugs in it  Some of the bugs were worked out in the 1995 makeover  However  it looks like the biggest bug  the tendency to roll over  will not be worked out until the 2002 model  
Neg, I inherited BOB T  named by my brother stands for big old brown truck  for my birthday 4 months ago  I paid a symbolic  1500  and while I love it  I m ready to sell it I d always wanted an SUV after a few years of driving my teeny tiny Toyota Tercel  so I was thrilled to get my brother s Explorer  When I got it  it had just over 101k miles on it  At first I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable the seats were and with all the nifty little places to store stuff  like under the front arm rest  I was even more delighted to see that my gas mileage was much better than expected  I get about 20 23 mpg in the city and about 25 on the highway  The acceleration is pretty darn good  I oftentimes beat sporty little cars out of stoplights  Once the initial delight wore off  that s when the problems started  Now I understand that my BOB T is 11 years old  but my brother took care of it well  so I didn t expect to be shelling out this kind of money  About 3 weeks after I got the truck  I had to replace the tranny  nice lil dent in my wallet  All seemed well for a week  but it started slipping again  I took it back to the dealership  and they fixed that problem to the tune of  575  About 2 weeks later  the brakes went out on me  Back to the dealership and had the brakes replaced  my wallet is taking a serious beating by now  The brakes haven t worked properly since then  and no dealership or mechanic has been able to fix the issue Just two weeks ago  I was driving down a busy street parkway and the brakes went out on me again  This time  I couldn t pump the brakes to get this behemoth vehicle to stop  I ended up losing control and hitting a guardrail  I didn t do any serious damage to myself or the truck  thank God  But to add insult to injury  as I was creeping back home from my little accident  the tranny slipped severely and I almost ran into the back of an ice cream truck  At that point  I just had the thing towed to the dealership and told them that it was now their problem  They  fixed  the braked and the tranny again this time to the tune of  2400  my wallet can t take much more of this torture  The last time I drove the truck was 4 days ago when I brought it home from the dealership  I m a little scared to drive it I kind of look at it as a deathtrap now  So now it s a very nice driveway decoration  Although I ve had some serious mechanical issues  I love this Explorer because it can haul some major stuff  I was able to haul all of my stuff home from college in one trip  that s nothing to sneeze at considering I had everything but the kitchen sink in my dorm room  I love the feeling of being up higher than everyone else  and it s a great vehicle to take on camping trips with a whole bunch of friends My best advice  you want an SUV  buy it new that way the warranty should take care of most any mechanical issue you can have  These are great vehicles  but older SUV s like mine are best left for off roading and camping  not your everyday commute  
Neg, I bought this because I needed 4WD and wanted something popular that I could easily resell  I bought it used at 128k and have put about 60k on it  In the 22 months of ownership  I have spent over  6 500 in repairs and have replaced the A C  the transmission  the 4WD gears and lots of minor stuff  The thing is my repair shop  to whom I am very loyal  explained they see the same repairs over and over on Explorers  This is the 2 A C replacement and the 2nd transmission replacement I put a lot of highway miles on my cars and have had this truck in 4WD for less than 100 miles total  I change the oil and have it serviced like a good boy and they fellow from whom I bought it was a nutcase for servicing  This truck  as popular as it has been  is not engineered to last  I will not buy another one of these     
Neg, My Ford Explorer was the first vehical i have ever bought on my own  The thing after i bought it was great  Loved it to death  I owned the road in it and i loved working on it Then one day the transmission went out  No big deal i thought  this happens after 138 000 miles  After that all was good for awhile till something else broke  When ever one thing would break  it would break something else  I spent over  1200 fixing sensors that blew each other out  Finally the last straw was when my engine blew  Evidently a bearing went out and is causing the crankshaft to walk out of the engine  ITs off the road now waiting to be rebuilt then sold to some other unlucky person Driving it was great  Off road or on road i only got stuck once  i was dumb  and it hugged the road  In my buddies Explorer  same year  we spun out on a dirt road goin 55 and was going sideways down the road  I figured we would have flipped over but it stayed stuck to the road  when we hit the clay embankment  injuries were non existant and the total damage was around  1000  It took the beating with out a problem  I was in a fender bender in mine and all i had was a scratch on my bumper when the lady had to get a whole new grill and stuff  I think the problem was that my bumper hit her grill hood  Too bad for the small car This is a great truck for someone who wants to rebuild it and modify it but not for someone with a small budget  me  The costs of keeping the engine and sorts working with this many miles on it was just too much br br  
Neg, First  I would like to state that I did not choose to buy my 92  Ford Explorer  My parents bought this sports utility vehicle for me on my sixteenth birthday  With out any knowledge of this vehicle  they bought it blindly from an auction no less  one thing that you should never do  As I was looking up good and bad trucks to buy from consumer reports  it states that this years ford explorer was a bad choice to buy because it has many problems  I absolutely hate this vehicle for the fact that every time I would like to go somewhere  something goes wrong with it  Every 1000 miles  I have to fill the oil up one quart  and it is such a pain to deal with  Then another thing that goes wrong with this car is that the windows  or electrical problems have started to arise  If you have ever rode a horse  it is the same feeling as riding in this truck  Anyone who wants to buy this vehicle  would be a fool br br  
Neg, It s 8 30 AM and I am on my way to work in my economy Toyota  Cruising in the fast lane  I notice a Ford Excursion poking along in the slow lane ahead of me  As I get closer to passing it  I notice the wall of SUV next to me getting closer to me  I slam on my breaks and the Excursions back end barley misses taking off the front end of my Toyota as it moves into the fast lane in front of me  Did the driver even see me  Were they even looking  Maybe those big mirrors on the side weren t aimed low enough to pick up my car  If they d hit me  would they have noticed  Now driving behind the mammoth  I can see the silhouette of the driver  the only person in it  through the back windows  Ah  the driver is on a cell phone  I honked and flashed my lights  but I don t think they noticed  Okay  this review is not just trashing the Excursion  I m mainly writing it to bring up a few important points about large SUVs to consider before purchasing  As you know  large SUVs have been stirring up a lot of controversy lately that buyers should know about before purchasing  I recently purchased a new car  but considered an SUV first and did a lot of research into them and promptly changed my mind First of all  there are lots off hidden costs on large SUVs  like the Excursion  Of course  unless you have  40 000  to spend on one  you are going to have a high car payment  Which is obvious  most consumers expect this  But did you budget the high fuel cost as well  A Ford Excursion weights about 7 600 pounds  Because of this  it has a V8 or a V10 engine  Which means it gets 12 5 miles per gallon or less  the V10 averages 7 miles per gallon  My Toyota gets 7 times that mileage  Meaning that an Excursion driver is paying on average 4 to 7 times more for gas that a car driver  This will add somewhere between  175 to  350 a month to your car payment  Still think you can afford this  Then lets talk insurance  Because the Excursion is big and heavy  if the driver gets into an accident  like what almost happened to me above  it will cause a lot of property damage and injuries that your insurance company will have to pay for  On top of that  there is a big risk that the drivers or drivers family of the smaller cars will sue you  Which means you and or your insurance company could be out a lot of money  They plan for this by charging a lot higher premium on SUVs than normal size cars  You should get a quote from your insurance company first Now  on average  the Excursion puts out over 3 times  or more with a V10  the carbon dioxide of a normal sized car  This really angers people who care about the environment and causes them to do things to protest against this  One of the popular things is  SUV tagging  Where they ll put bumper stickers on your SUV say mean things like your changing the climate and you don t care about the air  Please check out the sites I have listed below for more information on this http abcnews go com sections us DailyNews madtaggers001225 html http www baaction org SUVticket index html http www idontcareaboutair com bumpers index shtml http www charm net marc chronicle suv may01 html http poseur 4x4 org topten html This is a new trend and who knows where it will go  But do you want to constantly worry about your expensive SUV being vandalized and then pay for the repairs  That s just more costs to worry about  Like keeping your vehicle in your garage  Not the Excursion and most large SUVs  they won t fit unless you have a custom garage  I bet that s expensive also  Or just leave it out side all the time and worry about vandalism One more popular misconception about large SUVs is that they are safer for families  For the most part  they are not  Especially Fords  The new VW Beetle gets better crash test ratings that most Ford SUVs and trucks  Do your research first  
Neg, Sport and Sport Trac carry on for 2003 with some safety and equipment revisions to their 1995 vintage Explorer design  the more popular Explorer 4 dr wagon was redesigned last year  see separate entry  Sport is a 2 dr wagon  Sport Trac has a 4 dr SUV cabin  but gets a 4 ft long pickup truck bed in lieu of an enclosed cargo area  Both use a V6 engine with manual or 5 speed automatic transmission  They offer rear wheel drive or Ford s ControlTrac 4WD that can be left engaged on dry pavement and includes low range gearing  ABS is standard  For  03  Sport Trac gets the 4 wheel disc brakes already standard on Sport  Sport Trac is also due for optional curtain side airbags later in the model year  Sport loses its optional front side airbags  Newly available on both models are heated front seats  and during the year Sport Trac is expected to add an option package with a high end sound system and special wheels New to the class this year  Honda Pilot has taken the lead as a Best Buy  It offers ample cargo space  seating for eight passengers  all wheel drive with a locking rear differential for added traction  and above average refinement  Toyota Highlander is our other Best Buy  chosen for its on road competence  convenience  and attractive pricing and design Year to year sales for the three model Explorer line Sport 2 dr  Sport Trac pickup and 4 dr wagon dipped 6 6 percent in calendar 2001  a decent showing given the year s turbulent events  First half 2002 sales were down a nomimal 0 7 percent vs  the year earlier period  also not bad under the circumstances  The mainstay 4 door wagon got off to a slow start  but the factors working against it apparently have less effect on demand for the two Sport models Acceleration  V6 provides good off the line power and fine around town response  feeling overtaxed only in highway passing or on mountain upgrades Fuel Economy  Test Sport and Sport Trac models averaged 15 16 mpg in our tests  about par for a 6 cyl midsize SUV  Ford recommends 87 octane fuel Ride Quality  Sport Trac has a longer wheelbase than the Sport  and a far better ride  though it s still unforgiving over sharp bumps  especially the 4WD model  Sport has a bouncy  unpleasant ride on most any surface Steering Handling Braking  Sport Trac has more accurate steering and takes corners with slightly less body lean than Sport  though both handle with reasonable balance and confidence Quietness  Not car quiet  but not excessively loud for a truck based wagon  though tire and wind noise rise markedly with speed Instruments Controls Interior Materials  Straightforward and logical  but a mild stretch to climate controls  Power window switches are illuminated  Sport Trac s novel back window powers up and down at touch of dashboard button great for ventilation  Materials range from serviceable to leather fancy  workmanship is solid Room Comfort Driver Seating  front  Step in height is slightly taller than SUV norm  but there s plenty of room and a comfortable driving position Room Comfort  rear  Sport Trac s rear seat is roomier than that of any compact crew cab pickup  There s ample space for two adults  and three can squeeze in  Sport s 2 dr body makes getting in and out a real chore  and for cramped accommodations once aboard  Seat in both models is hard and lacks much shoulder support Cargo Room  Good in cabin storage  and both models  split rear seatback folds in single motion without removing the headrests  Sport has ample cargo room and separate opening liftglass  For Sport Trac  we recommend the optional bed extender that effectively lengthens the bed about 2 ft  Both models have undercarriage spare tire storage Value within Class  The uncomfortable 2 dr Sport is of limited appeal  while the Sport Trac has a deserved following based on its unique blend of passenger space and open bed versatility  
Neg, I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic  interior  power  warranty  options  etc  points of view  I believe an important  but always neglected area  though is from an undercar point of view  and let me tell you  most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed about the running gear  There are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there  but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my opinion  and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision  If a decision is being made between one of a few different vehicles  I hope to help you decide based on my experience  which one will be better for you from the standpoint of strength of  and reliability of  one of the most important parts of the vehicle as a whole  the steering and suspension system  The Ford Contour  unfortunately  from an undercar standpoint falls into the category of a weak and suspect suspension  I just read a great review by mkaresh on the Ford Contour from almost every other viewpoint but the undercar  but he is an intellectual professional and I am a mechanical professional and I m quite sure he doesn t spend a lot of time on a dirty shop floor  In times past I could look at my schedule at work and accurately predict by what vehicles were on it where I would be able to take a break because I would be sure I would just be writing an estimate and not doing an alignment on that one  Unfortunately the Contour is starting to come into this category  To start off with one of the things about the Contour that I don t like is that the ball joints and outer tie rods both are susceptible to premature wear out  Neither are factory greasable  but to be fair  hardly any cars anymore allow for chassis lube  In as little as 60 000 miles I have seen Contours needing both lower ball joints and outer tie rod ends replaced due to loosness  It is not an extremely expensive repair  but one would hope not to have to get that news at such a low mileage point  I am sure if you are the original owner things should be covered under warranty  but how many times has the dealer been very co operative with you and taken care of a warranty claim without any trouble   But if you are the second owner   Another bothersome problem cropping up with the Contour lately is the rear coil springs break  They seem very small in diameter compared to other cars in this class and are in fact weak  Usually in replacing coil springs on most vehicles you need a spring compressor to remove and replace springs due to the extreme pressure  but I changed rear springs on a Contour not too long ago and was able to push the spring down and start the nut on the strut shaft with just hand pressure  These were Ford motor company factory replacement springs  and hopefully an aftermarket spring will be stronger  The Contour is only toe adjustable  not allowing for any caster adjustment nor front or rear camber adjustment  so if you give it a little curb shot and it gets knocked out of align  there just is no taking it to your tech and tweaking it back into align  It is out and will stay out  except for the toe angle  If you are considering a new Contour read more reviews and weigh them out against this one to see if you can justify the purchase  if you are considering a used one  have it checked carefully by YOUR mechanic for the things mentioned above  Hopefully this will help you in making an informed decision  I for one would never own a Contour  but I am basing this on just my experience from underneath  you make the call      
Neg, So I had to drive a rental car for close to a month and I had two choices  The first was a Ford minivan which I simply would not drive under any circumstance  The second choice was a Ford Contour  and I have to tell you  it was the worst car i ever sat behind the wheel in  First off the Ford contour has all the visual appeal of Grandma s car in my humble opinion  I suppose not a whole lot more can be expected from Ford  Yes if you haven t noticed I am a touch biased  But with that said  I can honestly say I have not liked the look of one single Ford car since the early 90 s  and the Contour is no exception  The Interior is some what comfortable  but the look is very drab  There is no excitement to be found here  An awkward factory stereo consumes most of the center console and the rest is used up by oversized dials for the heater and air conditioning  One of my biggest problems with this car was the fact you couldn t turn the air conditioning on with the defroster on  Now for those who don t live in cold weather  the air conditioner will take the moisture out of the air and defog your windows  Very poor design  To top all the poor layout of the interior  everything was just cheap cheap plastic  Nothing fit snuggly so the whole cab of the car had rattles  Even at less then a year old and almost no miles this car was in poor condition  I hated driving it  Now that I have pointed out some of the flaws of the interior of the car I will tell you how it drove  It drove like a SUV  Not only did it have a horribly stiff suspension when you hit bumps in the road  but the car leaned like a SUV when you went around corners  You would feel like you were about to roll the car taking a corner any faster then 25  It s acceleration was less then stellar as well  Even with a V6 in the car you felt like it would take forever to get up to speed  The throttle response was horribly slow as well  If you needed to get some speed to make a pass you better plan ahead about three seconds  Not only did the car take forever to get to speed  it took just as long to stop  Perhaps part of this problem is due to the incredibly cheap Firestones the car comes with  I ended up having the ABS kick in no less then three times doing pretty standard stops  When the ABS didn t kick in  the car still took forever to stop due to its heavy weight  This car needs to go on a serious diet  Now the gas economy of this car was just as bad as everything else  With my 80 mile commute every day I usually had to stop every other day and get twenty dollars in gas  When I picked the car up from the rental company it had a quarter of a tank  before I even got home I had a gass light flashing at me  Another improvement that needs to be addressed are the headlights  The high beams were average  but the low beams were nonexistant  If you drive at 35 mph at night with the low beams on  you are overdriving them  This car doesn t make a good commute car  it doesn t make a good FUN car  its not built well enough to be a family car  I can t honestly think of anything good about this car  It would be a nice treat if ford stopped designing plain cars that are cheap to mass produce and design something that is better built  better to drive  more practical  and not so plain  Agree or disagree with me if you like  but this car goes into my books as a total blunder br br  
Neg, My mother owns a  94 Ford Contour Special Edition four door sedan  There have been Six  SIX  Manufacturer s recalls on various parts of the vehicle  She was only notified of this AFTER the recalled item had effectively ruined another part of the automobile   ex  The wiper blades malfunctioned and gouged her winshield  She takes impeccable care of it  yet things are constantly falling apart  The shop fixes one thing  and another goes wrong  Sure  all cars have their weak points  but it is ridiculous  Definately not a car for someone who doesn t know how to do home repairs Other than that it s a good little car  It has fast pick up  excellent braking  and the gas mileage is nothing short of miraculous for it s size  I m almost sorry to put it down  but consumers deserve the truth br br  
Neg, I recently sold my 1 1 2 year old 1998 5 Ford Contour SVT  What am I buying instead  A 2000 BMW 323Ci  This commentary will explain my recent and difficult decision  First  let me praise Ford s Special Vehicle Team for creating an extremely fun to drive and practical sports sedan  Performance in the SVT is impressive based on a relatively small V 6  The engine is one of the top 5 most efficient engines in the world  measured by HP divided by Liter  Low end torque is not exceptional  similar to other competing cars in the same class  Mid range torque is adequate  but high end torque is outright amazing  All of the fun and acceleration in this car is over 4 000 RPM s all the way to about 6 500 RPM s  It is not hard to chirp the tires shifting into second gear Handling is also superb  nothing like a Contour SE  Turn ins are sharp with almost no understeer  I always enjoyed highway entrance ramps in the SVT  by the time I reach the merge lane I could easily be going 80  MPH  One thing the SVT is known for is its sweet exhaust note  At idle it is a low rumble  almost resembling a V 8  During acceleration  the exhaust really comes to life  If you are behind an SVT you WILL hear it accelerate  As for the interior  it is basic and functional  The dash layout is not cluttered or overdone  i e  Pontiac  Unfortunately  it is very basic and almost seems to be missing something  This is a result of Ford s  quot decontenting quot  on the interior since the inception of the Contour in 1995 As for the reason I sold the SVT for a BMW  Two reasons overall quality and refinement  My SVT was in for small  pesky repairs on 3 occasions in the 18 months I owned it  It started with a squeaky clutch pedal  which is certainly annoying in rush hour traffic  Next  the paint on the sill panel below the driver s side door was beginning to peel  This is unacceptable based on paint technology in today s cars  Embarassing too  Lastly  the airbag indicator light began to blink intermittently  Upon further examination  the entire computer system was faulty and needed to be replaced  I sold the car with 28 000 miles on it before the warranty expired and these pesky repairs started coming out of my pocket As for the BMW  it may be more expensive than the SVT Contour  approx   6 000 with similar options  but it is a reliable  refined sport sedan  It has a better ride  is quicker  equal handling  and I no longer have to deal with Ford dealerships Overall  I would only recommend the SVT if you can live with pesky problems and have a well established relationship with the service manager of your local Ford dealership     
Neg, My parents currently own a 98  Ford Contour  the  quot Sport quot  version  My dad says that this car is his biggest mistake he had ever made  I always warned him about those Ford vehicles  where  quot Quality is our  1 Job quot  hah  This car has been recalled four times  now that is  quot Built Ford Tough quot  It has comfort seating for people that are three feet tall  When sitting in the back seat  you find out how flexible you are and how far you can put your legs behind your head  Good ol  Ford engineering put the oil filter right above the exhaust manifold  so where does all that oil drain onto  The exhaust manifold  and does it stink for at least three weeks after changing the oil  YES  Would I take this car if someone paid me to  NO  I think I would pay someone to take it away  My dad does that now cause it won t start  piece of FORD br br  
Neg, Have you ever written an opinion  only to have it be eaten by the server at the last second  I have tried to write this several times now  and with each revision  I get a little less amused I would up renting the Contour because my minivan was getting new brakes  The choices I had  about driving my van until the parts came in  no way  borrowing a car from a family member  haha  or doing without  led me to call the local U Rent It I was actually pretty pleased with the car  It fit the three of us well  there was an incredible amount of trunk space and I got really wonderful mileage  about 36 mpg  And then  as I revised  and revised  certain things began to stand out in my mind I am not a tall woman  I am not even five and a half feet tall  And yet  somehow  I managed 50  of the time to bang my knee getting into the car  I didn t need to readjust the seat or anything  it was back as far as it could roll  This is not a car for the NBA  Then there was the issue of the trunk  I like having space  but not at the expense of rear seat safety  The Contour has one of the folding back seats that instantly increases the trunk space  I am always afraid of being rear ended and getting a passenger impaled as a result  I don t trust the seat latches  Most of my driving was normal stuff  which is good  because the Contour does not have enough pluck to get you onto the Interstate and merging  Nor can it accelerate up hill  This might be a good thing if you are trying to cure yourself of speeding  but it drove me nuts  The ergonomics of the air and radio controls were aligned in such a way that I had to wait and read the buttons to see what was where  I don t like reading as I drive  The arm rest between the passenger and driver s seat was interesting  If it was down  you could not use the drink cups  or the storage  and it was so high that I felt like I was resting my arm on a plane level with my heart There are some people this is going to be a great car for  I am not one of them br br  
Neg, I have purchased 2 Ford Contours in the past 2 years  My reasoning for buying a Contour was the price  I felt I was getting a pretty nice  roomy  some what sporty car for the money  I needed a family car but did nt want a van or SUV  With my first Contour I had very few problems besides the few recalls  In August of 98 our Contour was in a accident  It had flipped hitting numerous trees before coming to a stop  Yes i was very surprised to hear that a Contour could be flipped by being ran off the road  But that still didnt bother us we decided to buy another Contour in Sept  98  From September to December of 99 we received 7 recalls  We returned 3 times for the same recall  We had NUMEROUS problems with our new car  Yet we still had faith in our car  Until just last week  Our car was in another accident  trying to avoid a deer our car swerved as we tried to regain control of the car it also flipped  In neither of our accidents did our air bags go off  But yet they were both considered TOTALED  I ask how can a semi family car have been so easily turned over not once but twice     
Neg, I was lucky enough to get to drive my best friend s 2000 Ford Contour SE for a week  and then drive it from New York state to Georgia  I was pleasantly suprised with the overall performance of the car  It felt very solid  but was obviously not well built  The entire top of the dashboard is peeling up near the base of the windshield and it looks awful for a 40k mile car  Also  the small pod that houses the power window switches on the driver s door feels very cheap and flimsy  When you press one of the buttons  the whole pod wiggles and creaks  as if it is going to fall into the door if you press too hard  I was not impressed with this  However  the car feels and sounds very solid overall and I was impressed The engine and transmission performance is questionable  but not terrible  The engine is snappy from a start and is powerful enough on the highway  However  due to it s small displacement of 2 0L  it is weak on hills at any speed  I also think the engine is a bit on the buzzy side  It idles buzzy and is buzzy when revved up  which it likes to do a lot  Overall  I think the engine is a good balance of performance and fuel economy at around 32mpg on the highway  The transmission  although silky smooth  is a slow shifting dog of a tranny  The shifts are very lethargic in nature  The tranny shifts very slowly from gear to gear  This can become a bit annoying in stop and go traffic when the transmsission up shifts even though you are already applying the brakes  I realized that pushing the  overdrive on off  button to keep the car from shifting into overdrive helps the excessive shifting alot The front seating is very supportive with great bolstering to keep your tushy from sliding around during cornering  I was really expecting my butt to be sore by the end of the 17 hour drive  but it wasn t  I also find the driving position to be very comfortable as well The stereo is a decent standard system  Nothing too bad or too great  just adequate  The controls on the stereo are standard issue tick tack size Ford stereo buttons that can be a little tricky to use while driving  The speaker performance seems a little weak  but not horrible  As far as the appearance of the car inside and out  I think it s an attractive car  although I prefer the front end styling of the previous design Contour  I love the rear end styling  It s attractive  simple  stylish  and looks like it belongs on a much more expensive car  The interior is modern  attractive  and functional overall  I like the dashboard used on the Mercury Mystique better though My only major concern with this car is the overall reliability  The trannies rarely last more than 100k miles  These cars are also plaugued with electrical bugs  Good luck to anyone who owns one  Overall  it s a very well designed car that was poorly executed  
Neg, I drove this pathetic little car for a weekend as a rental in Detroit  As I pointed out in the review of Detroit  my arms were sore at the end of the weekend  I was in town for a wedding and got the cheapo Hertz special at Detroit Airport  I got myself an ugly gold Contour that I had to run out through the rain to get from the Hertz lot  Now  Detroit is a car city  right  Well  these are some of the worst  most beat up roads I have ever come across  And the fine wheels of the Contour were putting all those bumps directly to my arms  This thing felt like it was made of plastic  except for the seats which were way too soft  I am probably a little skewed because of the bad roads  but this car had little going for it  It had all the standard  boring features of a mid size American car  It had little gusto on the freeways  although I didn t get a chance to try it on any hills because there apparently aren t any in Detroit  The trunk was nice and big and the windshield wipers fine  The maneuverability was fine  if not well heeled  The sightlines were fine  I think that this car stood out most for what it didn t do  stand out  It was just another boring  bad  lifeless American car  And I know a lot about those  having grown up driving a Buick Regal and now the proud owner of a Mercury Sable  Pony up a little more and try something besides the safe and boring American car     
Neg, It s really too bad about my Contour  It was an OK price  The car is alot of fun to drive  I have the SE version with the 170 hp V6  But  I have the reoccuring NO START problem  I go out to start it and about once a month it wont start  Turns over fine but won t catch  I have had it into Ford 7 times now and they can t seem to fix it  I am currently intereing into Arbitration with Ford on it  It s too bad because when it runs it is a blast to drive  Fast as hell  and corners like it is on rails  With the 205 tires that came standard on the SE you can do anything and it will track great  Worst cup holders in the world though  I gave up drinking coffee in it after spilling about 3 fulls cups  Also power window controls suck  they are flush with the door and are very hard to operate br br  
Neg, I have some bad news  and I have some good news  The bad news is that my car is in the repair shop with a leaking gas line  More bad news is I not only have to incur the expense of the repair  but I have to incur the expense of renting a car  as it s a holiday weekend and my car won t be done for several days  and I can t drive it like it is for fear that I ll blow up  Now for the good news  I guess  Just when I was cursing my car and thinking about buying another  the  Ford Contour  has made me appreciate my own vehicle  at least I know I will appreciate it once the repair is done There are three things I like about this 1999 4  door  Ford Contour  that I ve been driving for the past few days  one being the comfort of the driver s seat  two being a nice  cold air conditioner  and three being a fairly roomy back seat  My  Geo Prism  lacks in those departments  Other than those items I mentioned  I ve already decided I would never buy one of these  Contour s The first thing I noticed was how loud the engine is  My usual vehicle purrs in comparison  The sound system for the radio isn t as clear as mine  While I mentioned the air conditioner to be nice and cold  it has some drawbacks  too  It s rather noisy and no matter how you set the control  it s never just right  On low it doesn t operate effectively  and on the next notch it blows you away  noise and all  It s almost annoying to think about listening to the radio when it s on  The humidity was horrific in my city today  Usually  I just open the window  but today  I had to use the air conditioner  and  I ve got to tell you  if an ambulance or fire truck was in the area I never would ve heard its  sirens  The rental I have  which is the higher end model of the  Contour   i LX   does not have power windows and locks  cruise control  or ABS brakes  etc  so I can t comment on those  but  for what it does have  I m surprised to say that my  Geo Prism  gives a more enjoyable ride  at least a less noisy one  However  I d still opt to take a  Contour  over my car when going on a very long drive  because the seat gives much more support to my back than mine does This model  Contour  is equipped with driver and passenger front airbags  and has a decent looking instrument panel and dash  While giving a nice outward appearance  there is nothing particularly rich looking or feeling inside  nor does this auto have any outstanding features to write home about  and what surprised me the most  not even a cup holder The interior has blah grey cloth seats  Again  it s only a rental  so naturally I d customize it if I were buying  so I can t knock the choice of interior or color or features  I did notice something as soon as I rented it  though  and I mentioned it to the rental car representative  First of all  the side moldings of the car  which appear to be made of rubber  were the same exact color as the exterior  While there were no dents to the exterior  it was very noticeable that every scratch on it  whether it be big or small  had turned white  White against the dazzling emerald green is very noticeable  so I guess I d have to make a negative comment about the exterior paint finish  if this is the caliber one is to expect from a  Ford Contour   A good finish does not allow every hairline scratch to stick out like a sore thumb  As the  Contour  is bigger than my vehicle  I was disappointed to see that its  trunk was only slightly bigger  if bigger at all  than my car s trunk  The depth looked the same  so it amounted to the fact that you can probably fit two large pieces of luggage and no more if you consider the door hinges  They say there s a reason for everything  and a little good will come from something bad  I guess this is true because  while I was very disappointed to have the setback and costly repair and expense associated with my car s problem  I m glad I got to drive a newer car to see just what I was missing  While the  Contour  gives a nice appearance and a fairly smooth ride  overall  its  bad features outweigh its  good ones     
Neg, The reason that I bought my Ford Contour  is because we badly needed a dependable car  At least that is what we thought we were getting  On a whim we went to our nearest Ford dealer and started pricing new cars  We were trying to trade in our old piece of junk  But as we found out  we enjoyed our old piece of junk better than our new car We purchased this vehicle in November of 1999  We paid approximately  18 000  The salesperson was very helpful and knowledgeable in his field  Since November we have had several problems with this car  It has a high idle when coasting in the city and rural roads  usually under 45 mph  It does excellent on the highway  We have taken several trips from Indiana to North Carolina and have had no problems to speak of  This vehicle has a lot of room in the front but very little in the back  The side strip molding is falling off  It does not want to stay on very well  There is a constant rattling in the passenger side of the dash board  We have not had to take this car in yet but we are in the process of taking for its first visit to the dealership  This car comes equipped with cruise control  tilt steering wheel  ac  am fm cassette stereo  and a very spacious trunk  Also has low profile tires  which the only problem with that is that they are very expensive to replace  The interior and exterior colors are very pleasant to look at  I would not recommend this particular Ford automobile to the average person  This is for the average family of more than three people  I would not buy this car again because of the problems that we have encountered br br  
Neg, The most negative of my rental experiences I have saved for last  The 1999 Ford Contour  If this car had the options like a larger engine than the 4Cyl  a better sound system  better seats  something  then this might only be a mediocre rating  But there were none  It allowed for an entire 10 days of disappointing driving   Outside b Visually unremarkable  the Contour has the plain lines of a scaled down Taurus  The base model has nothing to make it look appealing  it still has Ford s unfortunate taste for ovals dominating it s appearance  Fit and finish is fine  it had a smallish trunk that seemed full with two medium bags and a laptop case  The doors are somewhat small  making entry and exit more challenging  The doors are also thinner  and feel flimsy compared to other cars that I have been driving   Inside  The seats were small and uncomfortable  The driver s seat reminded me of the long flight that I had just been through  It was a long trip and being unable to get settled simply made it worse  The panel display is flanked by a plastic divider that emphasizes how small the car is  It really worsens the cramped feeling in the passenger cabin  Engine noise is loud  with the 4cyl engine whining at almost every acceleration  It often overpowered the radio which was also whiny when played loud  I could quickly see that this car was not going to make the 1 5 hour journey pleasant  It does have the normal package of power windows  and locks  and they are easy to understand and use  The other controls are as easy to understand  but everything in the car has a cheap feel to it  I was consistently nervous that I was going to break something  But generally I was thinking of the engine   Driving  This is not a drivers car  At least not with  this  engine  As I dodged the 18 wheel heavies on the highway out of Cincinatti  I wasn t at all confident about the acceleration or the handling of the little Ford  Trying to pass a heavy dump truck on a two lane onramp I had the pedal to floor wishing for just some of the horsepower I had left garaged in Massachusetts  It was pretty much that way for the rest of the trip  Slow pickup  and that only to the tune of the engine whining loudly  Iffy handling in turns  I felt the car was at maximum performance at 75   All around  I won t drive this car again  I began specifically requesting full size cars after this unless I could get a Grand Am or a Mustang at close to the same rate  This car is fine for basic transportation or short trips  but I found it small  underpowered  and uncomfortable     
Neg, I was in the market for my first car in 1999   and I wanted to be very sure to buy a new car with decent credentials  I shopped around and did my research in the smaller midsize segment Ford s world car triplets  Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique for North America  and Ford Mondeo for the rest of the world  caught my attention  There was quite a hype about these vehicles  as Ford had spent  6 billion to create the infrastructure necessary to design a car that could be sold in just about any country   a concept familiar to the Japanese but very foreign to American companies  I do remember that these vehicles were named the European Car of the Year in 1994 and the North American Car of the Year in 1995  Just about everyone was raving about how these cars drove like the BMW 325 at only half the price  These were American cars with strong European personalities   after all  most of the design and engineering were done in Germany and UK Since I was still young  I was looking for a sporty vehicle  not a utilitarian family sedan  That meant that my preference was for European vehicles instead of the reliable but conservative Japanese sedans such as Honda Accord  There was no way for me to consider a four door American sedan  but I made an exception for the Contour Mystique  knowing that they had European personalities and that the other triplet  the Mondeo  was the best selling vehicle in its class in Europe  In the end  it came down to a choice between the Ford Contour and a true European sedan  the Volkswagen Jetta  Ford s longer warranty and cheaper price won out To fully exploit the European character  I chose a Contour that was equipped with V6 engine  manual transmission  4 wheel disc brakes  and a sport package  I felt quite confident  knowing that the only issues known were a few recalls and the rather smallish back seat  In fact  some people were even bragging about putting 150 000 miles on their Contours  having to replace only the water pump  That was not the case to be for me b Styling  inside and out  The exterior is definitely 1990s  with full of bubbles and curves that lead to the model s name  I liked the exterior because it was reminiscent of Ford s other European cars  as opposed to Ford s American models  My only gripe about the exterior is that the rear is just a blob of red lights and reflectors  I personally prefer the more conventional styling of the Mondeo  complete with amber turn signals The interior of my 1999 model is a sore loser  Compared to the interior in the Jetta  the Accord  or even lowly cars like the Corolla  my Contour is absolutely cheap  This wasn t the case when Contours first came out for the 1995 model year   those earlier Contours felt like high end European sedans inside  with stylish center consoles  useful and covered storage spaces  and well designed switches  In the early Contours  the interior lights turned on with a switch next to the light itself  in mine  I must use the dashboard dimmer switch  a cheap American trick I hate  The dimmer switch even heats up when I dim the instrument cluster for rural driving   that s REALLY cheap  Even worse  various switches and markings that once had been painted white were now simply embossed in my car  making them harder to see  And the newer center console in my car  It looks so cheap and old it should belong in a Tempo or Pinto instead The only thing that didn t change   and therefore retained its European character   was the instrument cluster  which is very legible and well lit  On the other hand  while the stalks for turn signals and windshield wipers kept their European look in my car  they feel very cheap when operating  I can even  feel  the click of the turn signal Adding insult to injury  the dash was so cheap it warped  It was an issue Ford fixed under a recall I had never heard of  until I had my car towed into a dealership b Driving and Seating Position  At least I didn t feel too bad sitting in the driver s seat  Every time I drive  I am treated to a decent seat  a leather wrapped steering wheel with very thick grip  and all switches  however cheap they may be  within easy reach  The seat doesn t have the height adjustment of newer cars  but it does have the standard fore aft and seatback adjustments  The front passenger seat is identical to the driver s seat The rear seat is indeed very cramped  Contours are saddled with ridiculously low headlines  and that means the rear seat is farther forward than where it should be  taking away legroom  This  midsize  car is even more cramped than compacts such as the Corolla  the Civic  or even Ford s own Focus   made even worse because of the cheap materials   Vinyl door liners belong to taxicabs and police cruisers   and are grossly inappropriate in my car  This is the primary reason why Ford never had success in selling Contours and Mystiques in North America  and it also explains why Ford increasingly cheapened these models  selling them as heavyweight  V6 compacts instead of midsize cars they otherwise should have been   Eventually  Ford billed the lightweight  compact Focus as the Contour replacement in North America  while it sells both the Focus and a redesigned  larger Mondeo in Europe  The compensation for the cramped rear seat is a large trunk  unfortunately  fold down rear seat was an option I skipped  and that limits the usefulness of the trunk b Performance  At least the BMW comparison was not an exaggeration  I carved mountain curves with ease and cruised highways in style  even going on a 6 000 mile road trip in October 2000  Steering is very precise  acceleration is decent  and brakes are superb  ABS was an expensive option I skipped though  so I must be very careful to avoid emergency braking  Before buying my Contour  I was used to cars that lean heavily into corners  such as the Corolla  this made me really appreciate the performance b Quality and Reliability  Ford s  6 billion investment had to have something to show up for it  In my car s case  the engine has proven to be superb  It still runs very smoothly  and there are virtually no signs of the 67 000  miles I ve put on it  There is some oil consumption but that is within acceptable limits  Splurging on Mobil 1 synthetic oil seems to have helped   but with the rest of the car being pure junk  I don t know if the cost is justifiable anymore Ignition system was another matter though  The engine uses distributorless ignition system  and the ignition coil failed for no reason at 60 000 miles  After a crazy round of parts swapping  and shopping for nonexistent ignition coils at odd hours  Ford dealers rarely stock these  a dealership finally fixed it   but only after putting in water into the fuel tank and blaming that water for the problems  and charging  1 000 to drain the fuel tank The transmission  the other part of the  6 billion investment  is already history  Manual transmissions are supposed to be virtually service free and trouble free  but the third gear is already destroyed  and the clutch has finally worn out  I ve been told that clutches are not supposed to wear out before 100 000 miles  even with severe abuse  this means that the clutch in my car was junk to start with  Adding insult to injury  clutch replacement will be a very expensive job  because the transmission area in my car is extremely cramped  I remember that owners of the souped up SVT Contours usually upgraded their differentials  fully knowing that the powertrain was too weak for the engine Exhaust is also gone  The 3 way catalytic converter failed completely  clogging the exhaust path and stalling the engine  It was as if I put in leaded gasoline into my car   something that could never happen these days  I always used the best brands of gasoline possible  usually Chevron   leaving even fewer excuses for exhaust failure  Perhaps the only excuse left is the water that had been put into the fuel tank by the previously mentioned dealership to blame the ignition failure on  Currently I only have one section of the catalytic coverter repaired  at least the exhaust is open again  but fuel economy has dropped by about 2 miles per gallon  and I will need a complete repair before my next smog test In the interior  rattles are starting to take over  and one of the radio speakers is starting to die  And of course  there was the warping dash which required a Ford recall  In the exterior  rubber window liners are falling apart as well  The left rear door also has an occasional rain leak I cannot trace Over the years  Contours have racked up six recalls   way too many  Even the best designed vehicles occasionally have a recall or two  but when there are six recalls  I must wonder what the heck the Ford engineers were doing with their  6 billion  The Focus  Ford s newer and smaller world car  is even worse  with already eight recalls and another four defects under U S  government investigation If money were no object  I would immediately have my Contour towed into a junkyard  The engine would be the only thing worth salvaging  and the rest of the car would be no more than scrap metal  In reality  selling the car isn t much better  because the depreciation on Contours has been extremely steep  In fact  repairs have already cost more than the value of the car itself b Dealer service  Ford has focused too much on its trucks  The average Ford dealer keeps only a dozen or so cars in stock as opposed to hundreds of pickup trucks and SUVs  Even worse  Ford s SUVs are popular because they are yuppie friendly  not because they are capable or well built  What does this mean  I get cut rate service when I bring in my Contour  while SUV owners get first class service In addition to the dealership that put water into my fuel tank  I also had to deal with dealerships on several other occasions   often over body work  One dealership improperly mounted the engine after the body work  causing my car to rattle in the engine compartment  I repeatedly went back to the dealership  but the body shop workers claimed to never hear it  hoping I would give up  Only after six months of complaint did the dealership give in  Another dealership chose to book me for body work and recall work on the same appointment  even though the body work was sublet out to an independent body shop next door  which was booked solid for the next two weeks  I ended up having to rent a car twice because the works were done separately   and insurance adjusters weren t happy  At least the body damage was not my fault  and was being paid by the other party s insurance   but I had to do some explaining to avoid rental charges b Owner clubs  With the dealerships being so useless  I hoped the owner clubs  particularly the online one at contour org  would be of some help  Sure  I did get hints about having to upgrade differentials on SVT Contours   which in turn meant a weak powertrain that couldn t handle the engine s power  But I found the owner clubs to be of immature minds who have nothing better to do than to street race just about any car in sight  from Acura Integras to Pontiac Grand Ams  Moreover  despite the Contour s European roots  many owners were of the isolationist  Pat Buchanan types  Everything from high fuel prices to traffic regulations was from the liberal globalist conspiracy I often judge a car by the types of people who drive them  I believe that driving a certain make and model of vehicle sends out a message about what kind of a person I am  especially since I am in car conscious Southern California  Given that criteria  the Contour fails again miserably  I don t have Rush Limbaugh or Dr  Laura pre set in my radio  and I certainly don t have a gun rack or a  Buchanan for President  bumper sticker  Perhaps if I were living in Europe and driving a Mondeo  the story could be different  There are quite a few other cars  some of them excellent ones like the Honda Civic  that I refuse to buy for the same reason   the image of the owners b Epilogue  I just returned from a trip to Beijing and Seoul  While riding on an expressway just outside Seoul  I spotted a Mondeo cruising alongside me   and mentioned that I drive one back home in the U S  My acquaintances riding with me were rather blunt in their response   Overpriced and crappy   that car has no reputation here in Korea  Get a Hyundai instead  Even five years ago these people would not have said such things  knowing how bad Hyundais were back then  Now it s different  Even after returning to the U S  and losing the clutch on my Contour  the first thing I heard was   Next time  get a Hyundai Sonata instead  Considering Hyundai s generous warranty  plus the fact that Hyundai dealers do care about passenger cars  I m actually agreeing with them  though I would rather buy a Japanese car  or even better  a Volkswagen if the budget allows  VW has also doubled its warranty as well  It appears that I ll have to start saving up for another vehicle fast  as I will most likely sell or junk my Contour before its smog test is due next year The Mercury Cougar  which has just ended production  is an identical design to the Contour Mystique Mondeo series  differing only with a hatchback sports car body  Even Jaguar s new small sedan  the X Type  is really a Mondeo with all wheel drive and lots of leather and wood  I know that I ll stay away from these choices as my next vehicle   and suggest that you stay away from anything based on the Contour family  Aside from the engine  everything else has been a disappointment  I never thought  6 billion could result in a car this bad  And if I absolutely need the feel of a BMW 325  I will have to take out a mortgage to get a real BMW 325  
Neg, I should start out by letting you know that I do not know much about cars  But after leasing this vehicle from Ford  I am ready to go back to the horse and buggy  The car has been in the shop more than it has been in my garage  We have leased it for 2 years and it has already had 2 recalls  It is extremely limited in space and anyone with small children will regret the day they purchase this lemon Ford has discontinued the model for the 2001 sales year and for good reasons  Although you cannot purchase this vehicle brand new  I would also discourage someone from buying it secondhand  To top it off  the service department at the Ford is horrendous  They lack professionalism  product knowledge and simple manners  I have to spend a lot time at the garage because of this horrible car and I am not sure if I will purchase another Ford again  The ride in the contour is rough and loud  On a major expressway it feels like you are riding on Space Mountain  The air conditioner is weak at best and the trunk can barely fit a stroller  I guess I should commend Ford for discontinuing this model br br  
Neg, The Mach 1 is back for the  03 model year after an almost 25 year absence in the Mustang lineup  Even though the original Mach 1 looks almost nothing like the new version  visually only sharing a shaker hood scoop  spoiler  and Mach 1 logos  they certainly have one major attribute in common  outright performance  Like the original  the 2003 version is designed for speed versus touring  many luxury items that would have added weight i e  heated seats  an optional navigation system  a sunroof  etc  are not offered in the Mach 1  In the end the Mach 1 is approximately 100 lbs lighter than a GT Coupe  The Ford Mustang has always thrived on its amazing power per dollar ratio  this is definitely the case with the 2003 Mach 1  For the 03 model year the Mach 1 is only available with Ford s DOHC 4 6 V8  basically the same engine that powered the  99 01 Mustang Cobra s  This engine pumps out 305 horsepower  45 more ponies than the SOHC V8 powered GT  thus making the Mach 1 one of the most powerful cars on sale in the U S south of 30 grand  Keeping in tune with performance purposes  a convertible which would have added performance hampering weight  is not on the list this year  a 2 door coupe is the only body style available with the Mach 1 trim b Note b  A 5 speed manual is standard  a 4 speed fully automatic transmission is available at  815   Driving Impressions b Like the original Mach 1  the 2003 version is fast  The  03 Mach 1 makes it clearly known by its superior throttle response and its burbly exhaust note at both startup and under full throttle that it s not just a stripped down version of the Mustang GT trim levels  If you own a  99 03 Mustang GT don t expect the Mach 1 to be loads faster  though there is definitely a noticeable difference in standing start acceleration b Note b  Traction control comes as standard equipment A few magazines report the 0 60 time of the Mach 1 to be as low as 5 2 seconds  which is only a shade faster than the GT  however the Mach 1 provides the driver with much more of a  throw you back in your seat   feeling than the GT  The 5 speed manual coupled to this DOHC V8 engine makes a great combo  The only major gripe I have here are the throws of the aluminum shifter  they are far too long for quick shifting  The 03 Mach 1 s shifter offers throws that are more reminiscent of a 1987 Ford Escort s manual shifter than a post  2000 performance car s 5 speed manual shifter  So does the hood scoop really shake at idle like the original  Hardly  Ford calls it a shaker hood  though if you don t have 20 20 vision you will be hard pressed to see it move  The shaker hood scoop for the  03 model year is more  cute  than  intimidating   as it once was back in 1969 i Cruising  through town or on the freeway is not the smoothest event  although by far surpasses the ride quality of the current generation Mustang s predecessor  Rattles and odd noises are still an issue with the Mustang  however it seems as though with each passing year the Mustang s ability to keep the driver in a rattle free environment while cruising gets slightly better  If you don t like the sound of your exhaust rumbling every second you are in your car then you might want to take a pass on the Mach 1  From idle  to redline  to just cruising at 65 MPH in 5th gear  the exhaust and engine rumble can be clearly heard in the cabin at almost all times  This is one of the Mach 1 s best features to most of the Mustang cult following  though I suspect many naive consumers will be overwhelmed by the decibel level in the cabin  The Mach 1 s robust engine exhaust note is unquestionably a case of  you either love it or hate it  Unlike many cars on the road that can claim close to the same 0 60 and 1 4 times as the Mach 1  the Mach 1 exhibits some of the best passing power since the late V8 Camaro s  Thanks to a decent amount of torque at a relatively low RPM  the Mach 1 never  needs  to be downshifted while cruising at freeway speeds to accomplish quick passing maneuvers  The same excellent power in top gear is also beneficial for extreme hill climbing  The Mach 1 accomplished every hill I put it up against  up to 6  grades  with no need to downshift  in fact the Mach 1 was more than happy to accelerate up these inclines in 5th gear  It seems as though downshifting into 4th to accomplish these types of road conditions just made for unnecessary engine noise  I have never been overly fond of driving the Mustangs on the twisties  Despite the grip offered from the big 245 Z rated 17  tires and the upgraded suspension  the Mach 1 still feels big around turns  Unlike the original  however  the  03 Mustang Mach 1 is acceptable on these types of roads  The original Mach 1 was almost scary to drive on twisty back roads  Not only did the original require huge arms to turn the vehicle at high speeds  but the tires also seemed to howl at every sharp bend  not the case with the  03 Mach 1   Braking  is excellent  With the 4 wheel disc brakes coupled with 4 wheel ABS I did not have a problem stopping this vehicle from 70 MPH to a stop  something an owner of the original Mach 1 could only dream of   Fuel economy  is acceptable  The Mach 1 is rated at 17 25 which gives it about the same EPA rating as most of the V8 powered Mustangs from 1979 2003 and most sport oriented cars on the market  One should note that the EPA rating of the Mustang is sort of a laughingstock among V8 powered Mustang owners  I have never talked to a Mustang owner who has received over 25 MPG  my late  98 Mustang GT averaged about 22 MPG  most owners whom I have talked with average between 18 21 MPG highway  An added problem in this department is that the 03 Mach 1 requires premium fuel  the GT can run off of regular  With gas prices reaching  2 10 in many areas of the world  just for regular  another   20 cents per gallon for premium is really going to put a hamper on your pocket book  The other downfall here is the small fuel tank  At only 15 7 gallons  your local gas stations will most likely be your new hangout   Interior b The interior is where my major gripes lie  To start  the instrument cluster gauges are absolutely tiny  These instruments are some of the smallest I have ever seen in an automobile produced by FOMOCO  Why Ford thought that the muscle car enthusiast would want tiny gauges is beyond me  Ford obviously is not catering to enthusiasts with less than perfect vision  The plastics throughout the cabin also feel overly cheap  From the plastic gadgetry  to the door panels  most surfaces feel like they were taken from an era where interior quality was an afterthought  One of my concerns  something I rarely mention in a review  is the sound of the frameless doors when they shut  they sound like they were put together with plastic and glue  I have not heard doors sound this poor in quality while closing since the 1st generation Dodge Neon s rolled off the assembly line   On to some positive notes   Ergonomics are excellent  As with all Mustangs I have driven  all the gadgetry in the Mach 1 is logically placed and easy to use  The leather seats are also a fine asset  These seats are both extremely comfortable and supportive  good bolstering in both the upper and lower portions of the seats  The premium seats found in the Mach 1 are completely different from the less desirable leather seats found in the GT or the V6 powered trim levels  Both the driver and front passenger seats offer manual adjustments  8 way driver  4 way passenger  Rear seating is unfortunately made of a cheaper type leather  This leather visually matches the more expensive front leather seats  however there is a definite difference in the texture and quality of the rear seating surfaces  As mentioned  the 2003 Mach 1  is not  loaded to the brim with embellishments  though the Mach 1 does come standard with enough equipment to satisfy most consumers looking for a car in this particular market  Some standard amenities on the Mach 1 include dual front air bags  a decent sounding Mach 460 AM FM 6 disc in dash CD system with 8 speakers  AC  power door locks  windows  titanium pedals  1 cup holder  two 12 volt power outlets  cruise control  etc  Since the Mach 1 is basically a package in itself there are not too many options beyond the standard equipment  In fact  other than the optional automatic transmission  815  the only other optional package that will cost you money is the interior upgrade package  445  This interior upgrade package gives you stainless steel pedals  an aluminum shift knob  and chrome accents  For more info on standard and optional equipment you can visit  www ford com  The Mustang Mach 1 might look like a roomy coupe  though it is anything but  The Ford Mustang remains one of the tightest fits next to the late Camaro Coupe  Up front  the driver and front passenger should have enough room  Being 5 6  and my passenger 6 1  we both had enough room to stretch our legs and necks  The rear  however  is a different story  Not only is leg room next to none  but head room is also limited  Having owned a 1998 GT nothing has changed  for the better  in this department over the years  For future reference  the redesigned  05 models are said to have a much roomier back seat b Note b  The Mustang Mach 1 can seat up to 4 adults Stowage space is actually not as bad as some people might think  With the rear 50 50 seats folded completely down  the Mustang Mach 1 can easily hold 2 weeks worth of groceries  My  98 GT  which was equally as roomy  enabled me to haul around new computers  huge vacuum cleaner boxes  etc  etc  with no problem  One should note that even though the Mustang does come with a glove box  it will probably only fit a few parking tickets b Exterior b  The Mach 1 is definitely a good looking muscle car and by far looks the most aggressive out of the Mustang lineup  including the Cobra  The major head turning feature of the Mach 1 is the raised hood with shaker scoop resting at the top  The Mach 1 also comes with an air dam  larger tires with very attractive 5 spoke Heritage chrome wheels  spoiler  and large Mach 1 logos to help segregate this car from its less powerful siblings  If a Mustang Mach 1 is a must on your shopping list  I highly suggest checking out a Mach 1 dressed up in black paint  Models that are painted  black  do not carry a painted racing stripe which  in my opinion  makes this Stang appear more tacky than aggressive b Price  Warranty b There is definitely one thing about the Mach 1 that you can count on  a relatively low price  With only 2 options available  the Mustang Mach 1 tops out at just under  30 000  about  9 000 less than the Mustang Cobra  and about  3 000 more than a fully loaded GT 2 door coupe  If anything happens to your Mustang Mach 1  Ford unfortunately offers one of the  worst  standard warranties on the market  a 3 year 36 000 mile bumper bumper warranty  An extended warranty can be purchased at an extra cost   Final Thoughts b I do like the Mustang Mach 1  though I do not recommend it for a few reasons  most notably due to the tawdry interior  Ford desperately needs to updated the interior with richer materials  increase the standard warranty by at least a few years and another 12 000 miles  and give this car a better shifter  I do  however  recommend the Mach 1 over the GT trim levels  Even though acceleration may not be that much better than the GT  which is already great  the Mach 1 is much more comfortable and will undoubtedly be a collectors car in the future  I definitely forecast much better resale value with the Mach 1 over the GT Willing to sacrifice a few seconds off your 0 60 time and the backseat of the Mach 1 for a more refined sports car  You may want to check out    a href content 87909764740  my review on the Nissan 350Z a     Thanks for reading 
Neg, There is a great deal of history to contend with when talking about the Mustang  Its appeal to a large segment of American drivers is impressive  and to some degree a Mustang lover will not be swayed by better performance found in foreign automobiles   that s not the point  Their loyalty is to the Mustang brand first and foremost With that history of loyalty has also come a great tradition of performance tuning these cars  so that there are several appealing options available to someone who has some money to spend  and wants a true high end performance machine  They will all cost you  though  the Ford produced Cobra SVT starts at about  34 000 while both Saleen and Roush make impressive models that will cost  35 000    40 000 or more This review  however  concentrates on the models at the other end of the scale  the entry level  affordable Mustang Coupe  The base Mustang comes in three option levels  Standard  Deluxe  and Premium  starting at about  18 000  and going up  500 or so with each level ENGINE DRIVETRAIN The base Mustang comes with a 3 8 litre V6 which makes 193 hp and 225 lb ft of torque  It is a dramatic step down from the V8 available on the higher end models  both in performance  and aesthetics  Where the V8 has the throaty growl you expect from a muscle car  the V6 of course does not  Married to 4 speed automatic  it is relatively quick  but not overly impressive  especially in the low end  You ll be able to merge into traffic and pass without discomfort  but is that really the performance level you want if you re buying a Mustang   I think we re looking for a little more performance  and to get it  you need to step up to the V8 The transmission is another sore spot  If you have to get the V6  stay with the default 5 speed manual instead of upgrading to the automatic  You maximize the performance  of the engine  and still get some performance  feel  with the stick  but the automatic is awful  Early shifts  still some lag when you mash the pedal   not good  The automatic increases your price by almost  800  so I wouldn t bother unless you have to For those who have grown up on today s front wheel drive vehicles  it is also worth noting that this is a rear wheel drive car  Yes  it comes with traction control now  but you will still be surprised if you get into rain or snow and try to gun the engine  The rear end is twitchy  and you ll have a hard time getting it back into shape once it goes EXTERIOR The Mustang retains its burly  muscle car appearance  The high rear end  and sloping windshield into the  fake  hood air intake give it its distinctive appearance that ensure you won t be confused with any other car on the road  That definitely has some appeal in an era when you sometimes can t tell the Jaguar X Type from a Taurus  Individuality is good  With that said  some of the old fit and finish concerns remain  The covers on the fake air dams are flimsy and look ready to come off at a moment s notice  Those air dams are another pet peeve  It smacks of pretend performance to include the hood  intake  with those behind each door  They re not functional for my money  you can leave them off next year  The available  on the Premium model  16 inch machined aluminum wheel are a positive  though  They re beefy  sporty  and fit well with the Mustang style INTERIOR Remember that you re essentially buying a detuned sports car  so the interior is not necessarily designed for touring  You slip down into the bucket seats  and while they re not impossible to get in and out of  some may find the extra effort needed to accomplish this annoying  When inside  the seats are comfortable enough  though if you re any taller than me  5 11  you may be a little cramped  Controls are conveniently located  and are standard Ford issue  The leather wrapped steering wheel available in the Premium model is a nice extra touch  While on the road  a driver unfamiliar with the Mustang may have a few complaints  Wind noise  while reduced from earlier model years  is still more noticeable than it should be  Part of the price you pay for that distinctive appearance  In addition  be aware that visibility is not on par with a larger  higher ride sedan  Again  part of the price you pay for getting into a  sports car  where you sit low The rear seats are utile  but not overly comfortable  Children will have no problem sitting there  but larger adults will be somewhat cramped  especially on longer rides MISCELLANEOUS Ford includes some decent options  Remote keyless entry  6 way power driver s seat  and an in dash 6 CD changer are standard in the Premium model  The ABS and Traction Control are also nice  and offset a bit the difficulty drivers may experience with the rear wheel drive CONCLUSION Ford markets the Mustang to a very specific market of American drivers who appreciate the history  the muscle car feel  and aren t looking for a cookie cutter Accord or Camry to drive around  For about 20 grand  you get a decent ride  a distinctive appearance  and reasonable power  The trade offs are iffy quality  some slightly old technology in the engine  transmission  and design  and poor visibility  If you re comfortable with that trade  this is the car for you  If true performance is your goal with the Mustang  consider stepping up to the higher end models available from either Ford or one of the performance tuning outfits like Saleen or Roush  
Neg, This entry level version of the iconic pony car looks muscular  from the flared wheel arches to the bumped up hood to the angled real lights and the agressive  mean   front headlights  Overall  though not classy or subtle  I find the shape attractive Loading up luggage is not a piece of cake  the boot is deep and wide  but the narrow opening makes it rather difficult to insert big items  A large size suitcase can barely be inserted  and as a result blocks access to the remainder of the trunk space  While on the topic  the glovebox is very small too  The instrument panel is clearly laid out  looks the business  Standard radio CD works decently  but the old fashioned telescopic antenna sticking out of the front right wing is anachronic  The headlights switch is a surprising design detail  I don t know if it echoes a feature of the original Mustangs  but its looks and its feel are really out of place  pulling on this button and hearing a whine when you rotate it to adjust the instrument backlight is the kind of heritage that contemporary buyers will easily want to do   without The front seats are not uncomfortable  but lateral support came really short of my expectations  Exploring the grip limits is a spine bending experience and makes you feel really uncomfortable  The fabric they are made off is cheap synthetic stuff  and the fit between parts forming the dash and central console does not leave a lasting impression of quality  wide gaps  mistalignment  leagues behind german  japanese  or maybe even korean standards The steering wheel  while a tad too big in diameter  offers good grip  an adequate thumbs in position  and is thick enough  The steering column feel remains quite numb however  the steering is not overly assisted  but does not communicate much about what s happening under the front wheels If I were to single out the one thing I disliked most about the car  it would certainly be the 4 speed  or rather 3  overdrive as I later discovered  auto transmission  Start from the fact that the gear change is located ridiculously far forward on the central console to be naturally within reach  The 4th  overdrive  gear is  as frequently  ridiculously long  making it really usable for highway cruising but a real annoyance in mid speed winding roads  As the overdrive engages as soon as you lift the throttle  it makes uphill or downhill driving a frustrating experience  2nd feels too short  The only remedy is to play with the overdrive off button concealed on the side of the lever  took me a while to discover it  Another gripe  the car I had was new  3000 miles  but the transmission sounded like a 300 000 miles yellow cab  with a vacuum cleaner noise in 1st and 2nd gear  torque converter   which sounded out of place at best  worrying at worst  Upshifts were not too smooth  contemporary gearboxes can achieve much better results  and downshifts felt busy and clumsy  not the seamless power on demand response you can obtain from german or japanese 5 speed automatic gearboxes The engine itself is decently torquey  max torque is reached at 2750 rpm according to the spec sheet and the car feels that way  but  for the sake of comparison  a GM V6 like the Pontiac GrandAm s is far more convincing  both in terms of grunt and noise  Redline is low  5300 rpm  and there is little incentive to rev it up that high  the engine does not sound rev happy at all  The car  equipped with standard 16 inch wheels  felt decently planted on its wheels  with grippy 225 tires  Turn in remained a bit lazy but the body roll is kept well in control   The Mustang goes where it is requested to  but there would be about as much feel as with a Playstation game  Visually  17 inchers would not look or feel out of place at all  The rear displays a hint of mobility  read tendancy to oversteer  although it is quickly tamed by the  switchable  anti skid control  The absence of a blocking rear differential may cause occasional inner rear wheel spin  especially on the wet  If you are seeking to be the king of power slides in the neighborhood  a V8 GT may be a better solution  The live rear axle is clearly perceivable through occasional sideways wobbles on uneven roads  not overly disturbing at a restrained pace  but likely to upset the car s balance at the limit  I would say that the chassis is good enough to cope with the 190hp of the base V6 without too much drama  but without too much competence and margin either  
Neg, This was my third car and my second Mustang  My first Mustang was the 1964 5 I bought from my neighbor on my 16th birthday  I loved that car  It was a shame the drunken redneck ran over it with his pickup truck  My next car was a 1989 Corolla  completely serviceable  never had a problem  but very boring When I decided I wanted something new  my first thought was an SUV  I was looking at cars when they drove in a truck full of Mustangs  I hadn t really seen the new body style at that time and wasn t thinking Mustang because of the boxier ones of the mid and late 80 s  But this car was beautiful  It was the first Ford that said   I m a Mustang  since the early 70 s  I probably bought the car because of my first Mustang  It was nostalgia as much as anything else  Second reason was that I wanted a sports car again  I could feel myself aging at the time  I was all of 22 and about to graduate from college  and I wanted a fun car again before I settled down  Third reason  it was a V8 at V6 prices What do I love about my Mustang  I live in one of the busiest driving cities in America  The average speed on Atlanta highways is about 80 MPH  In the left lane  you have to do almost 100 to stay alive  My Mustang can do that  Plus  I can dodge the out of staters and foreigners who don t know how to drive in Atlanta and are freaking out in the left lane while driving 55  Third  and probably the best thing  I can hit the gas on that V8 and leave everyone in the dust  well almost everyone  What is not good about this car  space  There isn t any  If you have to carry much more than yourself  you re in trouble  Another thing is the jealous idiots  I have actually caught someone urinating on my car  His friend was keying it at the time  Last problem  rear wheel drive  If you are somewhere icy  you probably know that a rear wheel drive vehicle is less stable  When I lived in TN during the ice storms  I had trouble in some areas and would fishtail  While a 360 is fun on purpose  it really sucks when it s an accident  Finally  my butt starts to hurt if I have to sit in the chair for more than 4 hours at a time So  who gets the car  Young people  single people  people with good driving records who can afford the insurance  If you aren t that person  or if you have more than two people you carry around with you on a regular basis  this isn t the car for you Update  Blew a head gasket at 100 000 miles  Apparently  the V6 also has a problem with this  And Ford knew about it and claims they sent out a service bulletin to inform owners  but they sent it to the wrong address and I never got it  I was just over the extended warranty on it and they wouldn t fix it  Repair would cost more than the car is worth  
Neg, If you look around high school and college campuses around the United States you will notice one thing is similar about all of them  that is the number of Ford Mustangs parked in the dorms and student parking lots  I remember as a younger driver  I always wanted a piece of the good old American muscle car and had narrowed my choice to a  68 Fastback and a  70 Mach 1  As my opinions differed and I grew up I noticed that the car I once held on to in my dreams became less appealing to me  It was a simple explanation really  I wanted to be different and how could I manage that without giving up the Mustang as a car choice  Granted up til  96 the engines were 5 0 liter and it seemed that the  89 GT was the fastest GT on the market  the one thing I could not overlook was the number of them on the road  I knew of two friends from high school who had consecutive models of mustangs  one was a  95 Cobra and the other a  96 GT 4 6 liter and that really discouraged me from buying one of my own  Another thing I encountered was the actual materials used to make a Mustang  My junior year of high school a friend and I were in a car accident involving a Mustang and an Explorer  Needless to say i was furious at what I saw constituting as a front bumper on a Mustang  styro foam  granted it was hard styro foam  the fact remained it was styro foam instead of some material more solid  For that I made my decision final  a mustang was not for me  Now I am not knocking any Mustang lovers down for their opinions but I am saying that when it comes to actual muscle cars of the nineties  this old boy will stick with the Chevy Corvette br br  
Neg, I enjoy the style of this car and its sleek design  One of the best features of this car is that it is a mustang and a mustang is a reliable car which can be trusted to last a long time  My friend has a Mustang Coba and he got a special paint job done that makes it three different colors when looked at through different angles  The ride is very smooth and the power is fenominal  The front is a great feature wich makes this car stand out som much and this car will make your heads turn  the power of this car can really be felt right when you turn the car on and you feel the reve of the engine and the feeling of power under the hood  if your looking for a great car at a great price  then put the Mustang Convetable Cobra on your test drive list     
Neg, I am the proud  well  sometimes proud owner of a 1995 Ford Mustang  I have found other owners of the same type of car as well  However  it s strange because we have all seemingly had the exact same problems with our cars  I bought this car in 1998 and here are the following repairs that I ve had done on it since then  I bought the car with 42 000 miles on it  so it was fairly new August 98 Gaskets Had to be replaced  found in many pieces Fan had to be replaced  found in many pieces Fan motor blown out Several hoses replaced due to fragmentation and tears September 98 Gaskets replaced for 2nd time  found in one piece November 98 Clutch had to be replaced  At this time I was at 48 000 miles  found in many many many pieces March 99 New tires destroyed when wheels somehow tear through them June 99 Had a total car tune up done  spent almost  700 to get car in good shape September 99 Gaskets blown out for 3rd time  found in several pieces Hole in Radiator October 99 Gaskets blown out for 4th time  found in several pieces January 00 Belts replaced and gaskets blown out again  5TH TIME April 00 New tires needed as alignment mysteriously got put off and the tires were just bought not even a year ago and have a 50K warranty on them  Only 20K miles have been put on car since the tires were bought April 00 New brake pads  rotors  brake kit  etc needed on front and back brakes Now  I ve compared this with other reports from other owners of the same car and I ve found continuing problems with the gaskets being blown out and parts actually exploding  rather than just wearing away  I had taken it to several different repair places so that I made sure it wasn t just the Ford repair centers  but it was actually the car  I ve found another 5 mustang owners of the same year with exactly the same gasket  radiator  and basically cooling system problems  So  I m pretty much starting to assume that their is a major design flaw in the Mustang and that something needs to be fixed or these cars need to be recalled and looked at  It s becoming quite expensive to fix them all I love the Mustang and I know the older cars are worthwhile  but I m starting to doubt the newer models  I ve heard more bad than good about the never models and their repairs than anything  Be very cautious br br  
Neg, Well  Here s your lemon story  I bought a 1995 Mustang  V6  new from the dealer  I loved the car  the body style  the interior   everything  At 2000 miles a fuel injector was replaced  At 4000 Ford was replacing my engine  Not to mention the horror story of the dealership wars  After that it was constant   I had an electrical short in the tape deck that no one could ever find  my oil pressure guage didn t work and was replaced  the emergency brake was replaced and the window mechanism was replaced 3 times and I still had problems  Needless to say  the car was eventually bought back and I received a 1998 Mustang V6  I ve had this Mustang for almost 2 years and no problems yet  Definately love the car  Now the only drawback is the snow and ice   mustangs are sleds in the winter br br  
Neg, PARENTS  beware I am now 27 years old  I bought a 1995 Mustang 5 years ago  I dreamed of having this car since I was a little girl however  I really wanted the older models  Anyway  I ended up purchasing a red one  6 cylinders  Very good condition  However  it proved to be a very dangerous item on the road  I had little experience driving fast cars  This pony has terrible handling in bad weather  A little rain and you will hydroplane all the way to the hospital  Its too light on the rear  fishtailing became a regular problem  I had an accident already on a draw bridge  I lost control on that metal surface flooring of the draw bridge  It had only rained for five minutes  A little water is all it took and I almost ended up on the canal  I purchase tires design to handle better in the rain  but it still handles awful  A teenager who has never driven a sports car may come to have their first accident in this pony  Many young people pull up next to me to race  It is a temptation that many teens are not willing to pass up  Also  it is rather small inside  The back seat is not comfortable for friends to sit and relax  There is noise in the cabin  Also  he may need to get a second job so he can fill up the tank twice week 25 00 each time   In other words  Buy your teen a relic for his first 4 years of driving  After that  he ll learn on his own when he sees how many of his friends have wrecked their  stangs  he might settle into a roomy Nissan Maxima   
Neg, Well I for one am personally glad they stopped making the Ford Probe  I actually love the look of the car  It was my first choice for a new car just coming out of college  Back in the early 80 s the look of the Probe did not really move me  But when they redesigned it I totally fell in love with it  For over a year it was the only car I wanted  Well in 1994 I purchased a brand new 1993 Ford Probe  It was the last one on the lot in the perfect shade a green the actual color I had been dreaming about  Well from then on it was a jinx  Within my first month I had to get a brand new set of breaks because they started squeaking two week after I got the car  Afterwards I continued to have minor problems with it  such as alignment and so on  But I stilled loved the car because it was so cute  Then for some reason my engine locked up  right after Christmas  I could not understand it because I got regular maintenance  Well thank goodness for extended warranties  Well I put the car in the shop to get a brand new motor  and when I went to pick it up from the Ford service dealer low and behold someone had hit my car and completely tore the rearview mirror off the passengers  side  Well of course they offered to pay for it but I had to bring it back on the following Monday so they could get me a loaner car  Well before I could get it back to them Monday morning  another car hit me and totaled my car  Well I was faced with getting a new car and I chose the 96 Ford Probe  Stupid me  Three months after getting the car my transmission goes out  Completely  I m still thankful for warranties Since then it had never really driven right  The performance of the car used to be so good  Greta pick up  speed ect  But the problem you encounter are sickening  After talking to some other Probe owners they have all encountered difficulties with the car  I m really sad that such a good looking car has so many problems under the hood br br  
Neg, OK  I finally went and did it  I took a test drive in the redesigned version of my truck  I guess I was kind of happy to be blissfully ignorant there for awhile  I was so in love with my  95 regular cab Ranger that I didn t want to have the myth shattered by driving the new one and risking disappointment  But  nevertheless  my curiosity got the best of me and I began to realize it s been awhile since I did a review on an actual car  So off it was to my nearest Ford dealership to see what they ve done with my truck I was quite surprised to find that they let me take the test drive alone  Not unhappy  mind you  but surprised  I was standing there while they put on the temporary plates expecting the salesman to jump into the passenger seat  but he just said   You know the area well  In response to my nod he tossed me the keys and said   Enjoy the ride  All the better for you  the reader  as I was able to get a better idea of performance than if I d had to treat it with kid gloves Equipment and options  I drove a 2001 XLT with the extended cab  four doors  rear jump seats  sliding rear windows  air  power mirrors  locks  and windows  anti lock brakes  and the premium stereo with CD and cassette  Quite a nicely equipped truck  There was nothing else in particular I thought I might need  In fact  I thought I could do without the cruise control  which I personally don t like to use  but it was a nifty feature for those interested  All in all  a very good bargain considering that it stickered for  18 600 Exterior  I m not too pleased with it  to be honest  The front has been drastically redesigned  while the rear is only slightly touched up with a lightly modified tail light treatment  The front makes this truck look far too much like a utilitarian appliance  with homely looking headlights on either side of a rather boring looking grill  It doesn t look as bad though with the body colored grill and bumper  My only problem with the tail lights was that it always seems weird to me when the white back up lights are on top of the cluster  as was the case here  The white looks better on the bottom  I know  I know  a strange hang up to be sure  but it s the way I feel  Overall  this truck is not particularly ugly or repulsive  just boring looking  They would have done much better by modifying the front fascia on the 98 2000 Rangers than they did with this one  If it were white I might have trouble distinguishing it from my washing machine The cast aluminum deep dish wheels are beautiful  I believe they had five spokes  They re a carryover from previous years and probably my favorite rim that comes with this truck  The 15 inch wheels and tires looked a bit small in the wheel wells though  I d probably need to go for a 4X4 or an Edge 4x2 with something a bit bigger  perhaps some 16 s The bed was a styleside  not those uselessly small flareside setups you see on some street trucks  The tail gate had the same removal system as the one on my truck  which is extremely easy and convenient  Pop two latches  flip the gate to about a 45 degree angle  and pull it out  The whole thing takes maybe 30 seconds It took me awhile to figure out what these weird looking things on the side bed rails were  I don t know if Ford was trying to come up with some sort of futuristic looking tie down bar or what  but it seems like they re for style more than anything else  They look like cheap  gaudy body cladding  except that it was on the rails instead of on the lower body panels  I guess it was an honorable attempt to blend bed rail protection with cargo securing tie downs  so I do give them points for that  But the tie downs on these rails were actually pretty difficult to use  as they were hidden out of sight beneath their protruding lips  If I get one  which is doubtful  I will put on real stainless steel tie down bars  not those cheap looking plastic pieces of junk Grade  C  for the exterior  Get rid of those bed mounted tie downs and change the front fascia Interior  As you might guess  I was less and less eager to get in the longer I looked at the truck  but I had already gone this far  The first thing I noticed was the vastly improved seats  My Ranger s 60 40 split bench offers almost no lumbar support  causing small aches to develop in my lower back after a couple hour s driving  The seats on this Ranger s 60 40 split bench were excellent for a truck  I could feel very good contouring at my lower back  right where the seats on previous Rangers got really flat  There was also good thigh support and noticeably more side bolstering  Not sports car like by a long shot  but it was nice to actually feel the seats curve up just a bit to keep me in place in tight curves The interior was a charcoal grey with black accents for the door handle  instrument gauge  and the radio housing  It looked a bit more upscale than the lighter colors  and the only parts that really looked cheap were the smooth plastics on the black inserts  This was a four door model  which made access to the rear area very easy for placement of groceries and luggage  One thing I would like to see on the Ranger that I ve found in the Tundra  but no other four  door pickup  is handles on the outsides so you don t have to go though opening the front door first to get the rears open The jump seats back there are still a joke  I wouldn t even put small kids back there because they d be unsafe in a crash due to the inward facing seating position  And those are the only people who would be comfy back there  Of course  it s only fair to remind you that pretty much every pickup in this segment except the Dodge Dakota  with its forward facing rear bench  tells that same joke  and you ll have to look at the extended cabs in full sized trucks or consider the light duty crew cabs if you want rear seating that is at least endurable in a pickup  Any adults who are not shaped like children will not be happy after more than a short 10 20 minute hop in those seats  which is about how long it usually takes for their novelty to wear off  The cup holders for those jump seats are an even crueler joke since no one should really be back there  The cup holders for front passengers are still in a bad place  placed on the floor of the cabin where they re difficult to reach  I d prefer a setup like I see on some S10 s where they unfold from the front of the center console  But one now has a removable carrying case for hot thermoses and other drinks The glove box is deep enough to be very useful  but that was about the limit of the lockable hidden storage inside the cab  The only other storage was a map pocket in each door  A locking bin under one of the front seats would be a welcome touch  I did like the special compartment for the jack though  On my truck it was just thrown back there haphazardly The gauges are all simple and clear  pretty much standard issue equipment since the early nineties  They have nice big white letters  You get engine and oil temperature gauges  a speedometer  fuel gauge  one to measure battery charge  and a tachometer  All the information I would wish to know  A useful twelve volt power outlet is displayed prominently next to the radio  This should be a very convenient way to run power tools and other small appliances off the battery  Buttons to operate the power accessories are on the door armrests  They were big  clear  and easy to figure out  Visibility was a big problem though  I get really annoyed nowadays at what seems too much of a willingness on the part of manufacturers to sarifice safety for style  Sleek  tiny side view mirrors may integrate well with a car s body  but they make for anoying blindspots  The rear view mirror was not long enough  The side view mirrors were too small and weirdly shaped  They angled upward sharply on the inside lower corner  right at a big blind spot  Buttons on the radio were big and fat and clearly marked  It s too bad really  The radio was very easy to use and offered dual media capabilities  but it offered flat  weak bass  However  it did have clear  finely detailed sound  The tape deck was a full logic unit with seek and scan functions  always an impressive thing to me  Definitely not powerful enough in the low ranges for my ears though  I would have to either specify that ground pounding 500 watt plus unit that will soon be available in the Edge or just order the cheapest radio I can get and swap it out for an after market system I noticed much more head  hip  shoulder  and legroom all around up front  The Ranger has now finally improved from liveable to very comfortable  with the much improved seating and increased space  When I put the key in I noticed that that stupid latch by the ignition that you need to push to release it is finally gone  thank god  However  the foot operated emergency brake no longer clicks when applied  something I missed  It just feels more reassuring when you can hear it go down to the last click when putting it on Overall  A  for the interior  It was much improved  Almost all serious shortcomings from previous models were addressed  with just a few annoyances left Ride  I started it up and pulled into traffic  One of the first things I noticed was the extremely low engine noise levels  The new 4 0 purrs like a kitten and makes smooth  refined noises at all speeds  None of the coarse  boomy quality of the old push rod engines The noises that really got to me came from wind  My  95 does not push air as loudly at over 90 mph as this one does at 60  One step forward in cost reduction for Ford  one step backward for noise levels  This is one loud truck  I believe the wind noise would slowly drive me insane on long trips  and that damn stereo isn t even powerful enough to overcome it Small bumps were well damped and never particularly jarring  The big ones really upset the cabin though and even elicited some rattles Ride  Gets a B  that would be vastly improved if they didn t skimp on sound deadening materials Handling  Body lean was very limited  and the truck felt sharp and agile in all situations  The steering was heavier than on some previous models I ve driven  including my own  allowing for much better road feel and requiring fewer inputs to plot a straight ahead course on the highway  I felt just a tiny bit of rear end floatiness at high speeds  but it was barely noticeable  In rapid high speed transitions there were no excess body motions  Even at over 50 mph  it was the same over and over  I steered sharply  the truck turned to its new course  and that was it  No bobbing and weaving  And what s best  on some tire spinning maneuvers that always upset the rear axle in my Ranger  this truck stayed composed and glued to the ground  In low speed parking lot maneuvers it seemed to require fewer twists of the wheel in tight turning  Braking was always straight and secure  though the brakes didn t grab quite as aggressively as I would have liked on sharp application Handling  A good  solid A  The truck points where you want it to go with no drama or excess body motions   Acceleration  This truck s biggest glaring weak point besides wind noise  I just never felt like the 4 0 V6 and the automatic transmission were working as a team  They felt more like enemies to me   Downshift now  screamed the throttle   Who s gonna make me  huh tough guy  Are you  is the defiant reply from the transmission  The power curve is weak  Sure  you do get a sharp kick when you floor it from a stand still  Things get quite boring after about 2 seconds though  as it gets weaker and weaker towards the mid ranges  There was a noticeable and disappointing lack of pulling power at medium and high speeds without a down shift  and those down shifts were slow and reluctant  usually coming 3 4 seconds after I asked for them  Passing power at higher speeds was OK because this motor likes to rev and makes good power at higher rpm s  but it still wasn t great even in lower gears  I had a feeling this had more to do with the 5 speed automatic s gearing than any inadequacy on the part of the new 4 0  And the transmission still had a tendency to leave me hanging  In general it didn t seem intuitive at all  And two different times at a stand still I could feel the idle skip ever so slightly  I wasn t sure if it was an engine problem or a torque converter problem  but it was not reassuring  The 4 0 does not come with stick right now  or so I hear  Guess that means I will not be going with the 4 0  The automatic just seemed to suck up too much of this engine s potential Acceleration  The engine could use a flatter power curve with more low speed torque and both a manual transmission and an improved automatic  C  sorry to say Overall tally  B  but let me emphasize that it just barely missed a C  The great ride  handling  and increased capacity really helped raise the grade My advice to Ranger fans considering this truck  Hold on to your older Rangers a little while longer  The 2001 redesign is not the huge step forward it would seem  It seems almost like a mediocre stop gap measure to fill in until the totally new truck arrives  Wait until the complete redesign coming up in 2003 to see if the Ranger can regain its greatness  
Neg, Nick bought our little navy blue 1993 Ford Ranger brand new 10 years ago with all of 5 miles on it  By 4000 miles the trouble had begun and they just culminated in a disaster that almost got me killed last week The Ranger is the little truck  Ours is a regular cab and regular bed  2 wheel drive  5 speed manuel  Nothing fancy or special  6 cyl  4 0 L  It got relatively good gas mileage  I m guestimating about 20  MPG  It s a cute little truck  resembling the Chevy S10 pretty closely The cloth interior was fairly easy to keep clean and for a bench seat in a truck  was actually pretty comfy  as comfy as it could possibly be for what it was It wasn t a race car so I didn t expect it to be fast  but it actually did handle much better than I anticipated  I scared Nick the way I took curves sometimes  For a truck  it handled curves pretty impressively actually When the brakes worked  they worked well  I could stop that thing on a dime  Yes  there actually were times in between repairs that I did enjoy driving this little truck The trouble began with the clutch fluid  See  the thingy is  inside  the bell housing on the Ranger  which is pretty odd  At about 4000 miles it started leaking  First we were having to add fluid like every other month  then every month  then every day  We finally took it in and had the unit changed about 2 years ago  it was fine for 6 month  then we had to start adding fluid again every month  you get the picture  Pain in the butt The oil was the same way  I had to add oil every 200 miles or so About 4 years ago some hoses went out  easy enough to replace a hose  right  Go in to the auto parts store and tell em ya want the hose to fit the 93 Ranger  sure they have that  Errr wait  It doesn t fit  There is no hose that fits  As a matter of fact  that hose was jerry rigged  at the factory   I kid you not  You could see where they had to heat it and stretch it to get it to fit  Real nice  eh We ve gone through clutches and had the transmission redone once  Accessories broke like clockwork  The brakes didn t last as long as they should  What else  ooooh yeas  the electrical system  We have jet skiis and a dual trailer  One year we decided to tow them on down to Key West for Christmas as our present to ourselves  About half way there  the lights went out  We bought a fuse  It blew  This continued the entire trip  I m not sure what got replaced finally to end that nightnmare  but it sucked This thing was just one problem after another for ten years  It was paid off  so we kept dealing with it  We should have gotten rid of it years ago  It made that decision for us last Monday I had just gotten back from the shop  New tires all around  new brakes  and oil change  Got the Safety Inspection sticker on Monday afternoon  So I decide to drive up to DC to see Nick who has been working up there during the week  I get to the draw bridge and clank clunk screech  can t shift  can t move  Dead in the middle of a slight curve on a damn draw bridge and the damn truck cannot even be pushed out of the way  It s totally seized up at 2 AM  The cars rushing past are barely swerving out of the way in time to avoid a major firey crash  I m standing there in the middle of the night leaning on my cane in tears and there is absolutely nothing I can do about anything  This was not fun  I now have a mental block when it comes to Fords  I ll never by another one  Luckily  a Tow Truck happened along on his way home about 15 minutes later and blocked the lane with his flashing lights  then got me towed to safety  even though I had NO cash on me i Double T Towing  of College Park  MD is owned by Tony and he is a sweetheart  I paid him the next day So now it s dead  and I am not going to resurrect it  We re donating it to some place for the tax credit  Cutting our losses as much as possible  I mean we had just put over  500 into it that weekend  Grr argh I do not recommend buying Ford  Anyone can get a lemon  that s true  but you have to consider the hose issue  Any company that sells a vehicle new off the show room floor with jerry rigged parts is a company that I do not want to do business with  Ever You ve been warned  
Neg, Well when I was test driving trucks I drove several late model compact pickups before finally decided on my 95 Ranger XLT  One of them is another Ranger  a stripped Base model I found on the same lot  At first  my parents thought  cheap  low mileage  let s go for it  So I had a closer look  This was a stripped  and I mean totally stripped  base model  No air  no tape deck  vinyl flat bench  manual everything  dough nut looking little tires  and that was pretty much it  There wasn t even any power steering  This was a barest of the bare bones models  designed to be a work vehicle  It seems like little trucklets like this one are the ones predestined from the factory to become those rough running 200 000 mile little rust buckets with springs that sag from constant overloading But my parents liked the price so I gave it a quick test drive  Well  what can I say about the interior on this truck  Well  it s a place where you sit  The vinyl floor isn t particularly attractive  so if you like quality looking materials look elsewhere  but it should be easy to hose out after muddy boots have made their mark  The numbers on the gauges are nice and easy to read  with the steering wheel made so the spokes do not block the view of the panel  The controls are simple  large  and easy to read  probably because there are no options so you don t have that many to clutter up the dash  The dash is the older square shape  before the interior was redesigned a couple years later  The plain  flat  rectangle and square shapes do not bulge and curve like the dashboards on later models  so everything is moved a bit farther away from the driver s reach and I found I had to look down more to operate the radio and heat controls  I missed the center armrest that usually makes it easy to rest your elbow while your hand works the controls  Did I mention no air  Or no tape deck  The am fm radio was tinny and fuzzy  But good enough to break up the monotony of lunch break at the construction site By the way I see more XLT s at work sites than strippers by far  Maybe even working men like their creature comforts The flat vinyl bench was  well  a place to rest your rear end  Not much more  Not designed for hours of comfortable cruising  just plain functional  There were also no headrests  which I find unforgivable in even the most stripped pickup made in the 90 s Then there was that power steering  Wait  no  I m confusing this with post stone age models  There was none  I ll admit  that s one less thing that might eventually break or require extra maintenance  but me and my parents ended up deciding it was worth it  Just try turning the wheel for the first ten seconds or so after start up before you get going and the steering warms up and effort gets lighter  I dare ya  With trucks like this who needs to lift weights  Just try maneuvering through a tight parking lot and you can get all the workout you need Handling was what could be expected with such a basic suspension setup  This truck sits low and is stiffly spung so it leans a little less that you might expect  but those puny 195 millimeter wide tires give out fast  And those leaf springs with a solid rear axle make for a nice dance number in bumpy corners  Ride damping was  well  truck like  Small bumps close together made it dance  The bigger ones were actually absorbed fairly well  just a solid  wump  with the suspension taking a good bit of the punishment before it reached the passengers  Of course  the really big pot holes gave me a headache  Sound deadening was probably another area where Ford did a little skimping  as the engine noise was ever present The little 2 3 4 banger does its job well in my truck  and in this truck it has considerably less weight to pull so I never felt like it lacked power  Merging into street traffic was pretty easy with the 145 lb feet of low end torque that motivates what must be a sub 3000 pound truck  Highway merging or passing are a different matter all together  You can do it  you just have to thrash this truck at 3000 rpm or maybe a little more  where it starts to get coarse and boomy  I don t recommend shifting below fourth at those speeds  but it gets tempting as it only pulls in 5th in ideal conditions and it only pulls in fourth over about 70 mph All in all  a work truck and no more  It does not presume to be a commuter vehicle or a highway cruiser  It is a work vehicle  to be used and abused until it falls apart  which should take quite awhile because of the lack of fancy extras or electronics that may be likely to develop problems in the future  If you absolutely have to have a truck and it s all you can afford go for it  with the reminder that this vehicle will not be much fun as a daily driver  Best left to those who need a reliable work horse OK maybe more like a work pony  and don t care about any options or frills  Me  I m quite happy that we paid a little more for my 95 XLT with 60 40 split bench and center console  tape deck  and rear sliding window  I strongly advise using some of the money saved by ordering the most basic power train and suspension for interior upgrades br br  
Neg, My son bought this 93 ford ranger a month ago and I had my doubts  He found at a used car dealer dye s in grantsville wv  When he took me for a test drive I said that it seem to shift hard auto  He said That I found some thing wrong with every car he found  The dealer said that the transmission had been rebuilt That ranger transmissions were week and that they had put in a larger pump and it would last longer that way  My son asked him if transmission was warranted and yes it was  Are state requires a 30 day 50 50 warranty  Well the transmission slipped a few times and finally got worse  When my son asked him about it before the 30 days was up  The dealer said you probably should get a new trans  my son then went to the place that rebuilt the trans  They said some fluid leak was normal  They finally said would order a modulator valve and let him know  When a young college student works hard for their money this hurts more than you know  He checked the gas mileage without the air on and it got a dismal 18 miles to the gallon  It should be against the law for car dealers to make a vehicle that gets less than 30 miles to the gallon  SUMMARY don t buy a ford ranger if your interested in fuel mileage getting a good transmission  Talk to several people and see if they recommend dealer or not br br  
Neg, My 2000 Ranger is my first Ford product in 12 years  My initial reaction to this vehicle  The quality of their products has remained the same or dropped in that time period vs  the expected improvement As a truck  my expectations were somewhat different vs  a passenger car  particularly in areas of ride and cab comfort  Generally  I was pleasantly surprised in both areas  However  the overall quality level of the truck quickly eroded any positive feelings for the vehicle Some of the quality problems were superficial or cosmetic   incorrectly cut carpeting  exposed wiring  radio knobs that have no start stop points  Not show stoppers  but enough to leave you uneasy about things you don t see or use on a regular basis Other quality issues were more problematic  The truck was delivered with loose front wheel bearings and was badly out of alignment   to the point of ruining the front tires within 800 miles due to cupping I have experienced  severe vibration in power steering assembly that it intermittent irregular idle and loss of power when clutch is disengaged air conditioning that fails to discharge evaporated water correctly  causing mildew in the evaporator box that must be flushed and deodorized on a regular basis  These are problems that I would expect to encounter at 80 000 miles  not at 800 miles As a daily driver  the truck is a mixed bag  Gas mileage has been disappointing   18 in town  20 on highway vs 22 27 rating  The ride is better than expected   somewhat choppy  but acceptable for a truck  especially with a short wheelbase On the positive side  the standard bench seats are comfortable and come with a 60 40 split  Legroom and headroom is adequate for a 6 0 person  The standard stereo system has a built in cd player and delivers better than average sound quality  The heater delivers more than adequate heat  but does suffer from A C odor problems  Dash board control and gauges are easy to read and provide more than standard idiot lights  A tach would be helpful with standard transmission models  especially to monitor idle levels This truck initially caught my eye due to its sticker price  which seemed very reasonable  Unfortunately  low price does not always mean value  and in this case  it didn t br br  
Neg, I bought this vehicle because it is a sharp looking truck  There  I have said something positive about it  Now  let s get to the real important info  The brakes on this truck are a joke  It has been in the shop 7 times for brake problems ranging from flat out brake loss to a leaky master cylinder to the brakes locking up and or failing in the rain  The stereo is excellent  however the speakers fail to deliver more than an annoying staticky rattle  The air conditioning won t allow you to adjust the temperature on MAX AC to anything but arctic  The power steering pump whines and moans  The power windows jump down in intervals instead of smoothly rolling down  The ride is stiff and bouncy  The transmission takes it sweet time going through the gears and sometimes missing one or two along the way Whether or not I make it to the end of the lease in this vehicle remains to be seen  Having paid almost  19K for it a year ago and having it only worth  11 9K in trade now with only 13 000 miles is disheartening  Do yourself a favor BUY SOMETHING ELSE br br  
Neg, I have been the unfortunate victim of Ford ownership  I know I have no one to blame but myself but the fact remains I have not one   but two Ford vehicles that I wish I never laid eyes on   One of these products is a 200 Ford Ranger which was purchased in September of 2000  The Ranger is a small truck 4 cylinder to boot   so my expections in the power department was pre decided  I bought the truck to skiddle around town in   and haul a this and that from Home Depot so power is not something I expected although the very lack of power is something I never expected  I am lucky to hit 35 after 5 minutes and the transmission does lag more than quite a bit It whines and cries upon any boot to the gas pedal and never gets up to speed Dont even attempt a freeway or an upward grade   I believe you may roll backwards  The gas milage is worse than bad and the promised 22 27 is far from being true  in fact it is more like 16 19 if your lucky  With gas at 2 00 a gallon I consider this a killjoy on the pocketbook  But the worse part of this Ranger is the lack of response from Ford or our dealership to do anything about the lack of power   not to mention the cosmetic problems   On wednesday of this week it wil be my seventh trip into the dealership to secure my inside roof  Yes   you got it the interior roof is collapsing and no one wants to do a thing about it  And living in a desert area I cant seem to keep the plastic molding from warpage no matter how ard I try  But Ford and their bumper to bumper warranty doesnt mean a hill of beans if they refuse to act and honor that warranty as they did in my case  Basically if there isnt a technician report sent out   then there isnt a problem  So since my transmission or interior doesnt have a tech report released by those wonderful engineers at Ford well I have to live with it and all the other rattles and hums this vehicle has  and in the mean time I feel stupider than stupid for giving Ford anything but a good cussing  So avoid Ford porducts unless you want to live the horrors of Ford ownership like I have for the past year and a half   
Neg, I bought my Ford Windstar for a few reasons 1  I have two active teenagers and a grandson  I wanted a vehicle that could also double as taxi for all of their friends 2  I love to travel by car and I thought that this vehicle would save me hotel motel fees 3  I love Lyndsey Wagner  LOL First let me tell you  I have the 98 version of the Windstar  I hate this van It s less comfortable than riding a Greyhound bus cross country  it eats gas like you wouldn t believe   15 city and 35 highway  I ve taken it into the shop many times  and the dealer always claims that the problem is fixed only to have many more    problems  I ve replaced the brakes more times than I can count  and the Windstar drinks up more oil than a sailor on leave Forget windy conditions  the Windstar bobs around like a ship lost at sea Last but not least  the seats do not lay down to make a bed  they fold  So there s no way to camp out in the Wind Star The ford Windstar reminds me of a nicely made bed with no sheets on it In other words  it looks pretty on the outside  but there is nothing under all that pretty lace br br  
Neg, I own a 98 Windstar that was purchased after we learned that we were expecting our second child  I spent hours reading consumer magazines and researching full size cars and mini vans  I pretty much knew that a mini van would be more up my alley so a larger car never had much of a chance  All that I had read about vans was that the Windstar was what we were looking for but probably out of our price range  Was I ever happy to read an ad in our local paper with a local dealer selling them at under 20 000 00 I must say that out of all the dealerships we went to while looking at various vans from different companies the Ford dealership won hands down as far as good sales people  The salesman listened to what we wanted in a van and made sure that it s what we got  When we didn t qualify for all of the rebates that were being offered he still made sure the selling price was in our range and we got some decent financing terms  After 3 days of debating we went ahead and purchased the Windstar After only having the van for a month or so was when our problems started  First it was a little thing  The windshield had come unsecured to the van and had to be re glued  After an all day stay at the service department we were on the road again  Then after about 3 or 4 months of ownership we had a transmission leak  After another stay  this time overnight  we were reunited  8 months after ownership we had to have a rod replaced  Things went relatively smooth for a while before we were back to the service dept  for mystery transmission problems and more noises coming from under the vehicle This time we needed to have a sensor in the transmission replaced  As for the mystery noises that turned out to be many things  We had another rod replaced  the steering column replaced  a cracked strut casing  and something else that escapes me at the moment Holy cow  I don t drive at breakneck speeds nor to I beat on a vehicle  I have two children in the van most of the time so I can t afford to be reckless  Now my van is acting up again with the transmission and the service dept  can t find a thing wrong with it  After a talk with the man that worked on my van I am no longer confident in Ford products  He explained that the vehicle that was sold to me was originally designed for mail delivery and not highway use  So at highway speeds it is possible that the van just acts up because the transmission can t handle them  Not a comforting thought Also I was told by the service dept  that Windstar s are known for having to have rods replaced Why didn t anyone tell me that before Now I have strange squeals coming form under the hood when I turn my a c on  I am 1000 miles away from going on to my extended warranty plan and I am grateful I bought it  I fear that I would go broke if I had not  Unfortunatly I am stuck with the van until it dies or my husband s car does  But I can tell you I look forward to the day when I can get a new van from another car manufacture br br  
Neg, I am a proponent of domestic vehicles  I realize that many imports are reported to have better quality assurance  better final product  I have never felt that the inflated cost of North America s favorite imports could be justified  maybe now I do  My 1998 Ford Windstar L has been a disappointment  I live in the country and commute daily to a large metropolitan area for work  It is a drive that could be considered  quot easy quot  as it is mostly highway driving on secondary roads at about 55 mph with not many stop and go s  Because of my commute I put on about 28 000 miles a year  I currently have approximately 41 000 miles  I require a reliable  comfortable and relatively economical vehicle  Surprisingly enough  the Windstar I own averages about 26 mpg and I have had up to 31 mpg in ideal weather conditions  The fuel economy was a pleasant bonus  On the other hand my Windstar has had MANY annoying small problems  During the warranty period  first 36 000 miles  I have had the following problems  a  Check Engine Light on  sensor defect  b  Mass Air Flow Sensor  MAF   when it goes you re dead in the water  improper air fuel mixture  it happened at 25 000 miles  c  Door ajar sensor  this one needs to be talked about  The sensor went due to a short in the ground  Interestingly enough  the rear wiper uses the same ground and as a result the rear wiper motor was fried  When this sensor goes   and it s over the weekend with no service dept  open  you have no alternative but to disconnect your battery as the dome light inside cannot be manually turned off  and if you don t your battery will run down  By disconnecting the positive battery terminal  you reset the onboard monitoring computer which renders engine diags  impossible until the computer  quot relearns quot  your driving habits and can set baselines for diagnostics  Maybe Ford  and other manufacturers that have the same setup  should use a separate backup system battery like the lithium Ion backup battery found in a Personal Computer  This sensor has gone twice  once due to a short in the ground  the other time for no apparent reason  It continues to sporadically go on and off while driving  d I have had occasional clunking in the front end  I brought the vehicle into the dealership and told them I suspected the transmission  It has occasionally had difficulty up down shifting at the gear cusp to overdrive about40 mph  They could find no obvious problem  but did find loose tie rods and replaced them  I am now past basic warranty and have the air bag sensor light staying on 6 seconds past when all other sensors have been initiated at startup  According to my manual  I need the air bag checked immediately  The feel of my vehicle is still not right  I have sporadic shuddering from either the transmission  the Mass Air Flow sensor  or the tie rods  or the idle arms etc  etc  My decision comes down to maintaining a safe vehicle by dumping money into an obviously sub standard product  or getting rid of it and eating a large amount of negative equity  I have had the vehicle only 16 months  Any way I look at it  keeping it may cost fortune  trading it will definitely cost a fortune  Either way  I as the consumer have been shafted A colleague of mine has a 96 Windstar and just had its transmission rebuilt  52 000 miles  It seems that Ford continue to use a transmission with a known engineering flaw  an aluminium piston  I had a 94 Sable wagon that had the piston go and the transmission was rebuilt with a steel piston as the replacement  Why doesn t Ford just re engineer the transmission  do a general recall and change the piston So what can I do  I have 3 children and need the flexibility of a minivan  I can t afford to change my vehicle every 1 1 2 years  Ford  Quality is no longer Job   1 Epilogue  I buckled  bit the bullet  dumped the turkey  The vehicle above has been traded for a Toyota Corolla  Big difference from a minivan  small for my family of five  but a great little car  Maybe Ford should pay out the negative equity that I just had to eat br br  
Neg, The Ford Winstar may seem like to answer to all your family s needs  but beware  there can be some drawbacks to this vehicle that you ll want to consider   PS  I saved the worst problem for last Why we bought a Winstar After a lengthly search of all the auto market has to offer for a family of seven to ride in  we settled on the Winstar  I have owned several Ford vehicles in the past and felt like  Quality was still Job  quot  this this brand  I was torn between the modern looking Taurus wagon and the Winstar  Although the Taurus wagon with the fold away jumpseat in the back actually seats 8  we felt like the benefits of the split front driver passenger seat in the minivan would be better for taking care of kids riding behind you  What I Hate About The Winstar 1  Inadequate Air Conditioning System Problems began a few hours after we rolled off the showroom floor and the passengers in the back  especially in the third seat became hot and sweaty  We realized that the air conditioning system is totally inadequate for rear passengers  We live in Texas  yes it get s hot here  however  any temperatures above 80 degrees and the folks in the back get hot and sweaty very quickly  I lost track of how many times I would arrive to the store or church and unload my poor soaking wet w sweat kids from the back  My baby drinks an extra bottle each time we go somewhere because he just gets so hot  If you get a Winstar  pay extra and get the second A C system or you ll regret it 2  Strangling Seatbelts This has not happened to us before  but the Winstar s seatbelts just don t seem to be satisfied with the hold they can have on you  They keep tightening up until your neck feels like it s being sawed off  or worse  you get a lovely seatbelt hickey to hide  I hate to say it  but I even found myself dressing in certain garments in order to protect my neck  I even bought short sleeved little turtlenecks in the summer  now  I keep a soft towel handy to tuck against my neck to alleviate  I am 5 1 2 feet tall so this is not a short person problem for me  however  if you aren t that tall  watch your neck 3  Power Steering Problems The hoses for the power steering leak and seem to be prone to developing this  Wouldn t you know that you can only get the hoses from Ford and they are expensive too  I have been having to add power steering fluid to the Winstar about twice a week or it makes a horrible grinding noise that makes nearby neighbors and pedestrians stop and stare as we drive by Get ear muffs for the neighbors unless you like  being noticed  alot 4  Flying hubcaps This is weird  but the hubcaps just don t like to stay on this car  Okay  you probably think I am a lousy driver  but after twenty years of driving  I have never had to replace so many  Of course the Ford hubcaps are  100  each  forget that  Good luck trying to by nice wheels for it  I found out the front wheel drive rims for this baby are a fortune   Get on with wheels 5  The Very Worst Thing About the Winstar This is the pathetic part  With this many problems  I wanted to trade my Winstar in for something else  I found out that after buying the vehicle 18 months previously and taking very good care of it  the Winstar I paid  22 000  for was now worth a trade in of  9000 only 18 short months and 16 000 miles later  I couldn t believe it I was so upset  I had to stomp out of several dealerships before I realized that this vehicle loses practically half it s value when you roll off the showroom floor  No one can justify that to me folks What I Love About It I still maintain that the design of the minivan is an excellent one for transporting people of all ages comfortably  The design of the Winstar is very functional  If you like the design  then may I suggest the Dodge Caravan  Both minivans are of a similar design  however  the new Caravans are more streamlined  cool the inside better  and the seatbelts are friendly  My mom got a Caravan and I am jealous  It is a pleasure to drive the Winstar  I like being able to see what s going on in the traffic ahead of me  I will confess  when I drove my Mom s Caravan  it did handle better and the back seat can actually switch places with the middle bench seat and give you more options  The Winstar does not allow you to switch the places of the seats  only to fold them down or take them out completely I have considered myself a Ford person up until now  I think I am going to go Dodge next time around  that is whenever I finally get out from under my Winstar s ridiculous trade in situation Take Care  Happy Motoring Love Your Margarine br br  
Neg, Let me start off by saying that when I leased my 1998 Ford Windstar it was in July of 1997  I leased it because it was rated number one in overall safety for mini vans that year I leased it for two years and when the lease was up my wife loved it so much that I purchased the vehicle for her  This vehicle is now 3 years old and has about a little over 12 000 miles on it When I leased this vehicle I thought it was covered by a five year  50 000 mile warranty  I was wrong it is only covered by a 3 year  36 000 mile warranty  After three years of driving this vehicle without ever having a problem the electric door locks started to malfunction  First the driver side would not lock then it would not open  then the side sliding door had the same trouble  when I finally got a day off of work I took it to my local dealer Island Ford on Staten Island NY  this is not the dealer I leased the vehicle from  and asked for the locks to be repaired  this is when I found out that my warranty had expired 6 DAYS EARLIER  They told me they would not fix the locks unless I paid for them    I was later lead to believe that it was because I did not purchase the vehicle from them or they would have taken care of the problem  I came home and called Ford  they said they would contact the dealer to see if this could be worked out and I should hear from Island Ford in 2 3 days  A week later I contacted Ford again to let them know I haven t heard from the dealer  they said they did the service manager refused to fix the vehicle  After days of haggling with ford and trying to go up the chain of command I finally get some guy who tells me my decision is final and nobody can change it  I wrote a E mail to Mr  Nasser the CEO of FORD and kept getting answers from different people but I could never get to him directly Their customer service is terrible Now this vehicle has locks that don t work because I didn t get there 6 days earlier and with only 12 000 miles on it  it sounds like the power steering pump is going  This vehicle is going up for sale as soon as the winter is over and that will END MY RELATIONSHIP WITH FORD FOREVER Whats your opinion  I d like to know    
Neg, I feel compelled to write this so noone else buys a Windstar  Maybe these vehicles are reliable for the first few years but then they go bad VERY quickly  I suppose the Winstar would work well as a leased vehicle  Any longer than 2 4 years and you re in for trouble I purchased a 98 Windstar and unless they ve made HUGE changes I can t imagine the new ones being much better  We know a Ford engineer we live in Michigan  and she say s Ford really cheapens out the Windstar parts  Everything is taken down to the bare minimum for nearly every important part  The Windstar is a big money maker for Ford During the 6 years of Windstar ownership I went through 1  Strut Replacement 2  Transmission rebuilt 3 times thank GOD for AAmco and lifetime warranty 3  Head Gasket blowout 4  Weird CLONK noise in front when going over bump very loud and nobody could find out what it was 5  Right side door lock made loud  craaaaank  noise when locked  Never fixed 6  Replaced Starter 7  Gas tank gasket seal broke and interior smelled like gas 8  Serpentine belt  tensioner pully  broke twice 9  Back end continually rattled while driving  Never fixed 10  Muffler had an O2 sensor  socket  blow out  Had to have the threaded nut welded back into the muffler 11  Power Steering  creeked  and was hard to turn  Never fixed 12  First 60 days of ownership the vehicle was in the shop for transmission issues nearly 45 days 13  The back plastic hatch handle inside  broke off several times 14  Tiny hub caps were replaced several times Obviously I m no longer a Winstar fan  In fact I regard it as the worst money I ve ever spent in my whole life  The Firestone repairman constantly said the Windstar and the Taurus were the 2 worst vehicles on the road  During the past 2 years we NEVER felt comfortable taking the Windstar on a long trip  The last trip was 12 months ago through Virginia and we swore the transmission was slipping  When we got back home the AAmco guy rebuilt the transmission for the 3rd time Needless to say I m done buying Ford and have moved to the Honda s  This is the second Ford vehicle to let me down  The first was the older Ford Granada but that s another story Dave 
Neg, This van was in the shop 7 times in the first 6 months that I owned it The engine would stall and then it would not restart  This happened once to me on the highway doing 120 kph  70 mph  Very very scary First the dealer told me that there was nothing wrong with it  The second time they claimed it was the O2 sensor  The third time they said it was the computer and they reprogrammed it  The fourth time they replaced the computer  The fifth time they replaced the throttle body and it finally seemed to cure the stalling All of this was done under warranty  but it was extremely inconvenient  In addition  I lost all confidence in the vehicle and ended up driving it in the slow lane  etc  in case it stalled out again  Ford refused to replace the vehicle The van has also had 2 tie rods replaced on separate occasions as well  This is on a vehicle with less than 60 000 kms   40 000 miles  on it  It was also in the shop to fix the cruise control as well  Finally  I was stranded again with an under the hood fuel leak Other highs and lows Rear seat removal is easy  but the seat is very heavy  Definitely a two person operation  The rear seat moves forward about 6 inches  which adds a bit of extra luggage space  It folds down as well  which is useful  because removing the seat is such a pain The factory roof rack is flimsy  with a very low load capacity I have the rear air option  We only use it to cool the van down after it has been sitting in the summer sun  Otherwise it can be almost too powerful  In the winter  there is no rear temperature control   we usually turn off the rear heat because it gets too hot We never use the tilting driver s seat for access to the rear seats  To allow for this feature  the driver s door is extra long  which makes it awkward in parking lots Front seats and the optional mid row captains chairs are comfortable  but I find the rear seat too hard and flat The engine has lots of low end torque  but runs out of steam as revs rise  The transmission is fine on upshifts  but can be hard on downshifts  The transmission is geared for relaxed cruising  Engine revs at 70 mph are around 2400 rpm  This makes for a relaxed ride  but ensures the need for a noisy downshift when passing The sliding side door rolls more smoothly and is easier for kids to close than some other mini van doors Sound insulation and ride is okay  There is an optional kiddie convex shaped mirror  which really helps to keep track on what the kids are doing in the back There is an optional control for the radio for the rear passengers  which can be good or bad depending upon what your kids like to listen to I also got the optional center console  which has a handy power outlet  The console adds lots of storage space  but makes access to the rear seats from the interior a little difficult  The power outlet in the console is always on  even when the key is out of the ignition  which is handy  I also got the optional power outlet for the center row seats  which is useful for the kids There is a door lock switch in the back hatch area which is handy The bolt cover for the optional alloy wheels is huge  It covers 1 3 of the wheel  which is ridiculous  considering that I spent the extra   for the alloy  not for plastic  
Neg, I bought my 1998 Windstar used in April of 2001  I thought I was making a sound choice  I did all of the research  poured over articles  ran a carfax report  and took it to a mechanic  Little did I know  My van has given me nothing but problems  I hadn t had my van for 5 days when I had to take it back to the dealer to get a transmission leak fixed all of the fluid was GONE  I then had to replace my serpentine belt which still squeeks  Then 4 months later my snap ring sensor on my ABS broke  I had to get my camshaft synchronizer replaced   not covered under my warranty  and no mechanic would touch it  I had numerous small problems with it that were covered under warranty  but cost me  100 00 every time I had to have them fixed  I finally thought I was all done with the major repairs then came the brake problems  We had 3 brake jobs done in 4 months only to realize that the hydrolic control unit on my front drivers side brake wasn t working surprise  surprise this was not covered under my extended warranty either  1 200  Not to mention my roof rack leaks so that every time it rains my seatbelts become soaked  Then my passenger side automatic window stopped working and my rear drivers side window only works half the time  I have sunk more money into this van  than any other car I have owned  I m shopping for a new vehicle now because I only have 8 000 miles left on my extended warranty and there is a knocking under the hood that we can t identify and it pulls unmercifully to the right  I ve had it alligned and had the tow checked  The only good thing I can say is that my dealerships repair shop and used car manager have bent over backwards trying to appease me  Maybe I just bought a lemon  but I will definately think twice before buying another Windstar  
Neg, The vehical I own is presently out of commision so my parents are letting me use thier 98 Ford Windstar  I am very greatful for them loaning it to me but  what a lemon  The inside light and dinger does not go off unless you are going 15 mph or faster and if you get below that speed limit  the interior light comes on and the ding ding ding chirps as loud as can be  I ve taken it in to be looked at more than once and the dealership always gives the van back saying  quot the problem is fixed quot  Maybe I should be gripping about the manufacturer but thats not the only problem  the ride is really smooth as long as you drive 70 mph or more  the seats don t lay down  they fold  which makes it impossible to use for camping  I would have never puchased this automobile  I wish they would hurry and fix my car     
Neg, I purchased a 98 Windstar in Spring of 1997 and now have 50 000 miles on it  I did not get a Dodge after having put a transmission in our last one  1994 so did everyone else I knew  I liked the extra room however we have had many minor problems  For one thing the wheels can not be balanced  2 new sets of tires  several balances  trip to dealer under warranty did not help  Currently the brake light is always on  they cruise control quit working  the seat panel fell off  and the rear heat operation is sporadic  I still have my 94 van and it drives smoother than the Windstar  Next time I will return to Dodge and just plan on putting in a new transmission at 50 000 miles     
Neg, While our instincts told us not to buy this vehicle  we did anyway  We bought our Windstar and sold it 3 months later  I believe Ford makes a good product  but this in my opinion is not  Our Windstar rattled  and just felt cheap  Having drove a Jeep SUV before the Windstar I missed sitting up high  and didn t feel as safe in the Windstar  It was easy to move around  but had no sportiness or fun when driving  I have driven other minivans that I felt were of a much higher quality than the Windstar  The carpet stained easily and was hard to clean  Just not a good buy in my opinion  Dawn   
Neg, I bought my 2001 Cobra in January 2003  I missed the power after selling my modified 1991 Mustang GT a couple of years ago  My Cobra had 13 000 miles on it  so  it was practically new  I was impressed with the power of the Cobra and the brakes  However  I had problems with my Cobra  There was what some call  driveline slop  when shifting  There would always be a loud clunking noise coming from the rear of the car  Eventually  there was a big  bang  one day and it turns out my rear differential failed  There were problems with the warranty repair but that s another story  See note at end  After getting the car back it drove better   Driveline slop  was gone  I was happy until a month later  when the rear axle bearings went out and needed to be towed back home  The car has left me stranded twice and it only now has 27 000 miles on it  The axle was repaired under warranty and now I will sell the car as soon as possible  I will not keep this car past the warranty period There are other things I should mention like the drivers s seat shifting during some cornering and the front bumper is loose  You can move it up and down with your hands  The Ford dealership says this is  normal  I don t think so The overall quality of the interior is kind of cheap looking with lot s of plastic  The shifter console is loose around the shifter  Just overall low quality  Looks like Ford just built a piece of crap car around a good engine and brakes  Note to anyone considering buying a used car from a Ford dealership  If the car is still under mfgr s warranty  have the dealership print you out a copy of the vehicle s  OASIS  report  That s the Ford vehicle info database  It shows all repairs done at Ford dealerships and it shows the vehicles warranty status  This could become important later  
Neg, I bought my Ford Explorer because of the way it drove  looked and performed  Last week I would have given the Explorer an A  review  However coming home from work last week  I experienced the fear of a lifetime  I always use my cruise control  and never doubted that when I put my foot on the brake  the cruise control would disengage  This was NOT the case last week  Instead  it went faster  I got off the Interstate  going about 70 miles an hour  I was relieved to be heading for a field  where I could not hurt anyone else  I tried to disengage the cruise control on the panel  with no success  As I neared the field I noticed that there was a rocky culvert and a barb wire fence surrounding it  making it impossible to get to the open field Having slowed the car down to 40 with the emergency brake  I was forced to throw the Explorer into Park  When my knees stopped shaking  I got out of the car and noticed that the tires were smoking  A man on a tracker came by and called for help When my friend arrived  he got in and the brakes worked fine  This leads me to believe that it is a defect in the cruise control Now my  Check Engine  light is on and the car does not idle  I have to push down on the excelerator  just to get my car to move  My tires are dangerous to drive on Hopefully Ford Motors will take care of the damage it caused  But I am not sure they will  as the car now has 50 000 miles on it and no longer under warranty  Has anyone had this problem occur to their Explorer  Whether under warranty or not  I think they should take this episode very seriously     
Neg, We bought a new Explorer in 1995 and felt we got a pretty good deal after beating on a couple of fleet sales managers  Some of the reasons we purchased the Limited are  we liked the leather option for the seats  the privacy glass for all but the driver and passenger windows   I really liked  the interior door lock by the back interior door  the ability to lower the back seats and move the front seats all the way forward to accommodate my 6 3  frame if I wanted to sleep inside the vehicle  it was not as tall as most all of the other SUV s so it would fit in our not so tall garage  the shift on the fly four wheel drive option  and the classic lines that didn t look like a GM product  Now mind you I have had a couple of other Ford products and had the same problem with at least 2 of them  THE TRANSMISSION We never thought that there would be the same problem with the Explorer  but at 8K miles guess what  After coming to a full stop the transmission locked up and it wasn t going to go anywhere  Fortunately the warranty covered the replacement and we were off to see the sights of Oregon  Since then the only problem we have encountered has been the automatic shock adjustment for different types of roads  They have not evenly leveled the vehicle and it is plain to see when you stand behind and look at it  It doesn t seem to affect the ride but we don t know what would be an obvious sign that it needed repaired other than just looking at it  One other real down side to the vehicle is the ride  On long trips the lumbar support just isn t there and driving can become painful br br  
Neg, We bought an Eddie Bauer Ford Explorer in 1995  We bought the car with a tow package and routinely used it to tow a popup camper  We loved the interior of the car and the way the car looked In the winter of 97  the car had 46 000 miles  We were moving to the Bay Area for 6 months and had rented a small U Haul  My husband was driving the car out to California  when in the middle of Nebraska  the transmission gave out  A Ford Dealer came out tow the car into the dealership  His comments to my husband  quot Didn t you know you cannot tow with a Ford quot  We had to totally replace the transmission on this car  All attempts to contact Ford to help with the payment were met with denial  We even Federal Expressed a letter to the president of Ford about this issue  3 months later we received a form letter We have found out since then Ford has awful issues with their transmissions  Check out all the web sites about this  We sold the car immediately and have since owned a Mercedes M Class  Great drive and great tow  and a Chevrolet Suburban 2000  WONDERFUL Do not waste your money on this car  It will fall apart on you and Ford will not care br br  
Neg, After reading the positive reviews posted on epinion  I thought I would share my negative experience with consumers  It seems the Ford focus is a hit or miss model  the cars built right run fine  but those that miss the mark are unreliable and a hazard on the road We bought a new Ford Focus three months ago  June 2002 in Las Vegas  The research  albeit a limited internet search  told of a car which was inexpensive  safe  well built and sporty  One week after we bought the focus  the car died on a busy freeway  It was repaired and returned in two days  Trusting the reliability of a new car  we drove from Nevada to Tucson  where it died again on a stretch of road called properly termed  Dead Man s Highway  in the middle of summer  Anyway  this type of incident occurred twice more since we ve owned the focus  And considering the car has been in the shop for almost half that time doesn t bode well for Ford reliabilty  Fuel pump problems seem to be our burden  but other focus owners have different  but equally disappointing problems with their vehicles  Something common to all focuses though are brake problems  Car rental companies with focuses on their lot are told to replace brake pads at 15 000 20 000 miles because pads fail like clockwork  Car owners  unfortunately  are only given a warranty on brakes for 3 years or 12 000 miles  so replacement pads are an out of pocket expense  A repeated problem continually found on focus complaint records are brakes that squeal and grind  The problem cannot be fixed  and Ford denies there are any design flaws  A website dedicated to filing a class action lawsuit against Ford  www fordfocusbreakproblems com  might be of further help  Also  read the negative reviews found on carsmart com  I believe my idea of a  hit or miss  car will be clear from the reviews posted on that site  For those who love your focus  I am jealous  I wish I could spend my weekends some place other then Ford service centers  For those who are looking to buy  do the research  Please heed my warning and don t risk your time and money into a Ford focus  
Neg, The Ford Aerostar minivan is one of the worst minivans ever made It s not dependable  it constantly needs repairs  and is not something you want to stare at  The only good thing about it is it s engine selection You can choose between a 4 cylinder  a 4 0 V6 or a 3 0 V6  I have a 3 0 version  When it s working it has good acceleration and horsepower  It has seating for seven and a large cargo area  It doesn t get good mileage and it gets pushed around by the wind It burns up master cylinders and transmissions  I personally would like to set mine on fire because it is not running well  My Aerostar s air conditioning hasn t worked in two years  Over all this van is not a very good vehicle br br  
Neg, While the Ford Taurus is a comfortable  and rather inexpensive car  it won t get high ratings from our family  True to form  this car has lived up to the FORD reputation of  quot Fix Or Repair Daily quot  Bought used after our beloved Jetta was totaled in an accident  this car seemed promising at the start  The front seats are plush and comfortable  The back seat is roomy enough for children  fits two car seats easily  but the middle seat is hard and uncomfortable  An arm rest can be brought down in the middle  and there s even a lap shoulder belt for the middle seat  but it feels like you re sitting on a rock hard surface  The back seats also folds down to expand the trunk room for hauling larger items The trunk itself is fairy large  not quite comparable to the roominess of a VW Jetta s trunk  but still plenty of room for playpens or groceries  The air conditioner and heater work well  but sometimes seem slow to kick in  The stereo system is an iffy item  On one hand  it has decent sound  and provides enough bass to make most music palatable  while on the other hand it is part of the console and pretty much irreplaceable  I wouldn t advise buying this car if you re the type to pop stereo systems in and out However nice the amenities seemed at first  we started having problems with it  It features a faulty Ford transmission that s always begging for repair  slipping in and out of gear  If you use any brake pads other than the Ford ones  they squeal  squeak  and squawk within a thousand miles  The disc pads do not just go in with a C Clamp either  you have to buy a special tool that looks like a little block  This makes a simple job a pain to complete Overall  while the Ford Taurus may be inexpensive  fairly comfortable  and feature decent power  it is no fun to constantly be repairing something or trying to figure out just what is squeaking this time  This Taurus needs to be put out to pasture br br  
Neg, We purchased a new Ford Taurus in 1996  In the first 3 year we owned the car it was to the dealer several times for minor repairs  The speedometer malfunctioned and had to be replaced and the alternator went out The major problems began after the car was out of warranty and had close to 60 000 miles on it The rear engine mounts were the first to go with repair costs being close to  800 00  Then once again the speedometer had to be replaced at a cost of approx   200 00  Over Thanksgiving weekend 1999 the fan that cools the motor went out It was taken to the Ford dealer for repairs at a cost of  200 00 When the car was returned to us with the new fan we noticed our heater was no longer working  It was taken back to the Ford dealer and low and behold it had a blown head gasket 1000 00  The car is once again returned to us  The very first time I drive it the check engine light comes on and I smell radiator fluid  The car goes back to the dealer and this time has a split radiator with the cost being  200 00  I am almost scared to drive it now  I really like this car due to the fact that it has a great safety rating and it is a very comfortable car to drive and ride in  However I would recommend that you trade it in before it goes out of warranty br br  
Neg, The Taurus I am driving is a company car assigned to me a little over 2 year ago  The following information should be useful for someone who is considering purchasing one as a used car EXTERIOR  3 My white Taurus looks like an albino sperm whale  The rounded windshield  rounded rear window  bug eyed headlights  and the smiling mouth grill opening combine to make this a cartoon of a car INTERIOR  5 The interior appears to be well thought out with one exception  the terrible ergonomics of the front seats  There is no lumbar support or side support  I ve developed chronic aches in my shoulders from leaning on the fold down center console and the inside of the driver door  I am 5 5 quot  and weigh 125 lbs  Perhaps the seats were designed for much wider drivers  Three of my colleague  of various girth  who also drive the Taurus complained the same of the GL s base seats  Other than the seats  The rest interior is very roomy and quiet at any speed  Headroom and legroom are plentiful  The dash is made of high grade plastic and rattle free even after 75 000 miles  The trunk will swallow just about anything even plywood with the rear seats folded down  The lift over height may be low  but the wide tail lamps reduced the trunk width ENGINE  8 The 3 0 liter V6 accelerates very nicely and provides excellent fuel economy for a full size car nearly 30MPG freeway HANDLING  8 Sometimes forgetting that this is not a sports car  I would take some curves too fast  The Taurus is very forgiving  however  in response with some body roll and tire squeals  Very good handling for an American sedan RELIABILITY  3 My company purchased about 20 of these vehicles and reliability has become an issue  One Taurus  definitely a lemon  was in the shop 3 times within a one year period for the same problem  The engine would just quit while cruising on the freeway  The dealership replaced several electrical components before the problem went away  At approximately 60 000 miles most of these cars began experiencing transmission  quot slips or lurches quot  We spent  1200 on one of these  Just last week  the mass air flow sensor  some component for emissions control and engine regulation  went out on mine  The part itself costs  400 VALUE  4 The depreciation on the Taurus is horrendous  from  20 000 to  5000 in four years THE VERDICT  A VERY GOOD CAR WHEN NEW WITH UPGRADED SEATS Don t purchase this as a used vehicle unless you are a mechanic or have a mechanic buddy     
Neg, My two year old Ford Taurus has been in for service ten times for the same steering and alignment problem  Each time  the service manager says   quot It s fixed quot  as they always replace some suspension component  BUT  it s never fixed  In fact  it keeps getting worse  They will not provide a loaner  even though it s under warranty and has been out of service at the dealer for OVER 60 days now I like the car  based on its styling  size  features  etc  but now my wife will no longer drive it  it s just too difficult to keep it going straight  You have to exert a considerable amount of effort to the steering wheel to stop the pulling which gets worse the faster the car is going Now the service manager say   quot We don t want to put any more money into your car  so we ll give you  3000 off a new one to trade out of your car quot  But  they offered me  8500 to  9000 for my car that had a sticker of  25 250 only 2 years ago  That s another way Ford gets to make money on you  they try to shift their problem to you even though you have a warranty  and they believe you should pay them for their incompetence  and total disrespect for their customers What I think  they would then sell this car on their used car lot for an additional profit  of course  and cause another customer to suffer with it like we did  If they could fix it before putting it on the used car lot  why wouldn t they fix it for me  ANSWER  They can t and they don t care who they hurt as long as they make money at the customer s expense My advice  Ford makes nice  interesting cars  but when they make a bad one  they don t care  The Ford Customer Assistance Center  CAC  says you have to take these issues up with the dealer  I told them my warranty is from Ford  They do not care  So beware of buying a Ford  the warranty means nothing to them  THEY DO NOT CARE     
Neg, I purchased a 1996 Ford Taurus program car with 18 000 miles on it  From day 1  I have regretted that decision and will until I am rid of this lemon  I use my vehicles heavily and in the last year and a half  I have put 60 000 miles on it  I maintain my vehicles well  but for this car  it didn t matter  In 1 1 2 years  I have replaced the entire front end assembly three  3  times  replaced the transmission  and replaced the cam sensor due to hard starting  None of these repairs have fixed any of the problems with this P O S  I have written several letters to Ford to express my deep displeasure and concern with an inferior product and to my dismay  no responses were ever given  It is easy to see that Ford is perfectly happy to create an inferior product to sell to the U S  public No way would I ever recommend to anyone a Ford Taurus  I have a 1996 and have driven a 1999  The only good quality this vehicle has is that the ride is very smooth  although the front end assembly clunks when you hit the slightest of bumps br br  
Neg, This car is okay  but not at all what I had anticipated  I would classify it on the smaller end of mid size car  at least in the passenger seating area  Maybe because mine is a wagon they moved everything up to make the wagon end bigger  I don t know  But to fit 5 people in is very cramped Also  it is a V6 but lacks any ooomph in its acceleration  We bought this 96 vehicle in 98 with 30K miles and it only has 40K miles now but it already has problems starting on occasion  On the upside  I think it is a decent looking car for being a wagon and the rear seats fold down for more carrying area when needed  Mine has the third seat in back too which will come in handy down the road  For a smallish person like myself  the car is actually perfect   I get lost in a mig car anyway  It is just not the perfect family size vehicle we thought a stationwagon would be br br  
Neg, It amazes me to go through all the internet resources and realize what a wide spread problem the Ford company has with head gaskets  I have always liked my Taurus yet at 47000 miles it is falling apart  Since February 2000 It has been in the shop 4 times  My warranty doesn t cover head gasket repair  which is what my independent mechanic says is wrong with it  Ford will not take the word of an independent mechanic only a Ford mechanic  First they said it was the overflow tank which I had replace in March due to rusty  leaking water Now in May I have rusty  leaking water again  the dealership says its not a head gasket   now it s the freeze plug and I need a bypass kit  Anyway I am frustrated and I would like to hear anything related to the 1996 Taurus  I can sympathize  By the way my car has been very well maintained and loved  Please send any information or horror stories to C85k87n90 aol com Thanks     
Neg, I bought my 1996 Ford Taurus at a dealership in Powhatan Virginia because I loved the way it handled and the way it looked  In addition I spoke with other Taurus owners  and was told that you couldn t beat the Taurus 3 liter engine for dependability  I was a happy owner for the first 2 years  Then one day  my wife was driving the Taurus with my 2 children buckled in the back seat  when the engine overheated badly  She found a place to pull over  as the steam came pouring out from the cracks under the hood  She called me  and I had the car towed to the nearest service station that evening  The problem was that a freeze plug had corroded so badly  it finally gave way The mechanic informed me that there was also a lot of rust in the cooling system  He replaced the freeze plug  and flushed the cooling system  About 2 months later  I had the same problem  rusty water pouring out of a badly corroded freeze plug  I took the car to my regular mechanic  and he informed me that there was a recall on my Taurus for which I was never notified  The reason I was given for the recall was that Ford had manufactured the 1996 Taurus 3 liter engine and installed it in the vehicle without treating the inside of the block with a rust inhibitor I had the vehicle towed to the nearest Ford dealer  and they reimbursed me for the freeze plug that I had had replaced at the service station  treated the block and replaced the most recently corroded freeze plug The very next day  on my way to work  coolant came pouring out of the block and the car overheated for the third time  The dealer had the vehicle towed back to the shop and replaced the remainder of the freeze plugs  over the course of the next 2 years  I had the vehicle back to the dealership 2 times complaining that my temperature guage was going up  almost to the red  when I was idling and would go back down when I was crusing  Each time the service manager informed me that he could not duplicate the problem  The Taurus now has 83 000 miles on it  For the past few weeks  I had noticed that it had a slow coolant leak  I took it back to the dealership 2 days ago  Yesterday the service manager called to say that he needed to pull off the power steering pump and the alternator to find the source of the leak  After doing that  he called to say a freeze plug had to be replaced once again  and that Ford would not be paying the bill because my warranty was expired  I agreed to pay  at a reduced labor rate  for the repair  After replacing the freeze plug  he called to inform me that it was still leaking  He said that it was his opinion that I should replace the engine rather than sink any more money into the rusted one  He said he would try to get the Ford factory rep to pay for all but  500 of the repair but that I should call the 1 800 392 ford Customer Service line I called them and spoke with a lady there who informed me that Ford would have paid for the engine up to 75 000 miles  but that since I had 83 000 miles on my vehicle  that Ford would not pay anything  It was my contention  that since I have it documented at the dealership that I was having coolant problems all along that I was not out of warranty at all It is also my contention that my 1996 Taurus was doomed the day they manufactured the engine without treating the block with a rust inhibitor Ford Motor Company had to know that the 1996 Ford Taurus would experience catastrophic problems before 100 000 miles  I will never purchase another Ford product again  and I suggest that anyone reading this follow suit     
Neg, Here s everything I have nice to say about this car I purchased my 1994 Thunderbird from a Seattle car dealership 6 months ago  It was in impeccable condition and had 38 000 miles on it  The previous owners were a retired couple who had kept the car garaged the entire time they had it  They elected to trade it in because they wanted a full size Buick  Purchase price for this vehicle was  7800  and the original sticker price for this V6 equipped version was  17 000 I would have never anticipated buying a Ford Thunderbird this old  but the low mileage and condition of the car were what sold me  Compared to the 1978 El Camino I d been driving  this car was pure nirvana to drive One thing I like about the car is its smooth ride  The suspension is not so soft that you feel detached from the road  but far more comfortable than a subcompact like my Ford Escort  a great little econobox  by the way  but that s a future epinion Fit and finish of the car is above average  Seats are comfortable without being overly soft  Leg room is ample in front  but in back is only adequate My car has cloth seats  leather wrapped steering wheel and shifter  power driver s seat adjustment  power mirrors  overdrive  cruise control and for speaker JBL factory stereo with cassette  Sound system is OK  and now that everyone has CD s  the system is a candidate for upgrading Now for the bad news   buyer beware At approximately 60 000 miles the engine suffered catastrophic head gasket failure and completely toasted the engine  The engine had to be replaced to the tune of  4200 but in my case the bulk of this was covered by the extended warranty I purchased   Ford s reconditioned engines address this head gasket problem  The  94 T Birds did have a Ford  Customer Care  notification on record  not exactly a recall  but something just short of that  because of the problem they were having with blown head gaskets  Unfortunately  this notification is no longer valid on  94 T Birds My advice   stay away from this car due to this head gasket problem  
Neg, Let me start by saying the first time I laid eyes on this car I fell in love with it  The exterior styling was sharp yet not outlandish  The interior was  in my opinion absolutely perfect  I could not imagine the controls being any easier to reach or more intuitive to operate  I especially drooled over the automatic climate controls   Why do more cars not have this feature  Even the shifter knob seemed to fit right into my hand  Though at the time I could not afford it new  I test drove it  the V8 version  and loved the way it picked up and handled  I wanted wanted WANTED this car  A couple years later I totaled the car I did own in a huge snow caused multi car pileup  I needed a replacement immediately  To my great joy I found a  94 T Bird used with only 18k for almost half of the new price  It was the V6 and the color was terrible  but it still seemed like a divine gift of fate  I loved the car for the first couple years I had it  not a single notable problem  Until In 2000 with almost 60k on it  the head gasket blew  Just like the previous review mentioned  it was covered under an extended  pseudo recall  plan because it was such a common problem in the V6 models  To Ford s credit  the motor was replaced completely with no cost to me  AND  with a little coaxing  they actually gave me a loaner to drive for the entire time it took to get the motor there and installed  several weeks  At the time I chalked it up to a bad engineering flaw which they atoned for at their expense  Until 6 months later  the transmission died  I was kinda tight on money at the time  and rather than dropping almost 3 grand to have it completely rebuilt  I opted to replace it with a used one  I realize the risk I took  but I figured it was the best I could do  and took my chances  THEN  in 2002  THAT transmission died on me  I much considered dropping the car right then  but I had JUST paid it off a couple months before and in spite of my better judgement  a part of me still loved that car  A few months passed  and other minor problems popped up  which I attributed to age  including a brake cylinder blow out which luckily happened at parking lot speed and was fixed rather cheaply  and less notably a bushing in the front steering assembly that rotted away due to winter driving and some hard braking on my part  It also started making some noise due to a bad catalytic converter and some undiagnosed squeaky rattle coming from somewhere in the front brakes  The death blow was dealt by yet ANOTHER problem with either the head gasket at close to 60k on the new motor  I thought this problem had been remedied at the time it was replaced  guess I was wrong  or possibly intake gaskets in that vicinity  At this point I have surrendered  The maintenance nightmare has worn away even the most optimistic and forgiving parts of my deep desire to love this monsterous piece of metal  In summary  I did manage to get almost 100k miles out of the car  though I probably sank more money into it than any logical person would  The times when it was running problem free it WAS a dream to drive  and I still hold to the belief that much of the car is of the highest design and ergonomic caliber  But the incidence of MAJOR mechanical problems with the most essential  and expensive  parts of the car are absolutely unforgivable  I have not heard any of these complaints with the V8 version  only with the 3 8L V6  If you have one of these  and you have not yet had problems  not likely 9 years after production  then PLEASE do what you can to either get rid of the car or get it serviced before it self destructs  I really wish that cues could be taken from the interior of this car  and many of the EXCELLENT intuitive features and transferred to other vehicles  but as much as I once loved this car  I cannot recommend anyone to do anything but avoid it like the plague  
Neg, I am in a construction business that forces me to move from one area to another as projects end  With a new project assignment comes a new company vehicle  This time it s a 2000 Ford Ranger  a step down from my previous Ford Explorer  Needless to say  I was not happy for this downgraded vehicle at first especially with the stripped down absolute base Ranger model  But  it s free  so I don t complain I must confess that I am not a truck person  so I probably would never buy one with my own money  I have ridden a Ford F 150 that is much nicer than a Ranger  but I would still prefer a car or an SUV over a pickup truck  I understand that some people are just the opposite we are all different  Another fact is that it is difficult to like a cheap vehicle once you have gotten used to a more expensive one  Liking a particular vehicle is therefore all  quot Relative quot  to what you have been used to  If you are stepping up to a Ranger from that 1970 VW Bug  you will love the improvements such as acceleration  quietness  etc  However  if you have been driving a 2000 VW Bug  this is a giant stepping down for its sluggish acceleration  noisy interior  and sheer ugliness  There  you get the picture of Relativity The Ranger I drive has no optional equipment other than its 4 speed automatic transmission  It even come with manual window cranks that I thought have long gone away from automotive industry  A pickup truck is good for carrying stuff from hardware stores to my new home  It s just convenient to throw things in the back and go as long as it s not raining  If it rains  there s not enough room to put anything inside the cab  And for the obvious reasons  it s not convenient to shop from store to store as your purchases are exposed to open area unprotected  My Ranger came with a standard vinyl bench seat  and this is definitely a back killer for longer drives  In another words  it is very uncomfortable to drive more than 30 minutes or so  For me  a seat comfort is the number one importance more than any others  The 4 cylinder engine gets less than 20 mpg for combined city and highway driving making you to think it has good performance  However  its acceleration is  by today s standard  very poor  Also  my accelerator pedal sticks in the morning  so pressing it harder makes it  quot jump quot  initially  This problem goes away after the engine warms up  While driving it is fairly easy  handling is not  Making a turn requires a gentle touch  needing to come to almost a complete stop Forward visibility is good because its higher sitting position  but I was quite surprised to find out how difficult it was to check my blind spots  It definitely has rear spots that are harder to check Again  I drive it because it s free  not because I like it  If you are a  quot truck quot  person  then this could be a no non sense worry free vehicle  Then again  if you are used to a pick up like F 150  just forget about getting a Ranger as you will be dreadful  Where is your Reference Point br br  
Neg, I have a 91 Ford Taurus 3 0L AXODE in Silver Grey  This car is excellent for a family of four  and has plenty of leg room  and for a 91 a well designed ageless feel to it  The car has 200000 km  It was the first attempt by Ford to use Dr  Deming s Japanese quality theory  It s still going  however I do use rust check spray every other year to stop salt damage in the Canadian winter  The car handles very well  is low and wide and I never feel unsafe driving  The car still has original alternator  steering  radiator  fuel system  engine computer  emission control  convertor  front shocks  engine  wiper motor  master cylinder  fuel pump tank  I had to replace the transmission  below  starter  failed relay  brake booster  front bearing  front CV  right  muffler  tie rods  inner and outer  front bearings  water pump  2  plugs  wires  cap rotor  battery  A C clutch  A C seals  Apart from the transmission  I consider this all normal wear and tear Now the A C has failed  Last year there was a musty odour  and perhaps the evaporator has failed  Regardless it will cost 1500 2000 to fix and is simply not worth it at this age  A C must be the most unreliable part of any car  Transmission Failure   Avoid cars with the 3 8L engine  gasket failure  and all cars from 1991 onwards  They suffer from weak transmissions  clutch failure and lube tubes  All Taurus Sable and Windstar are prone to expensive repairs  I have had to replace the transmission at 130000km and 6 5 years  Ford attitude is unacceptable even though they extended the warranty  I should have been a total recall  Once the warranty is over  Ford are not interested in further compensation    All being said  however for a second hand vehicle   I paid 10000 and i ve owned it 8 5 years  I think I have had overall value for money but I do not like the shoddy transmission If you own a Ford  expect niggling problems  and possible major component failures  I suggest you invest in a web based extended warranty and buy a 2 3 year old product  At least you still have service life out of the car  and did not pay much for a decent family car  Check out the web carefully for upcoming class actions and general comments on this car It also helps if you are a bit of a do it yourselfer and are able to figure out what might be the problem  before you go to your chosen independant local mechanic br br  
Neg, From experience  I would have to say that this car is not worth the money you would spend on it  This was my first car and it had eighty thousand miles on it  It is a six cylinder  3 0 liter  From the start  I have had problems with my breaks  causing me to have them replaced four times in two years  One time my break pads actually fell out about three months after i had them fixed Other problems that reoccured with my taurus is the transmission and motor mounts  I had to replace my transmission two time in eight months  The same with my motor mounts  When I finally got rid of my car  the transmission was dying again and it has only been seven months since the last time it broke  My motor mounts have cracked open twice  both time when I was driving  My alternator died twice  again when I was driving  At the time that I got rid of my car  the alignment was getting unaligned for no reason  I would be driving and it would get worse and worse I know another person who had a 1989 taurus gl and she has had the same problems  I heard of a recall for a certain part of the car and went to check it out and I found that there are many parts on recall for this car I do have to say that this car does hold up well in an accident  though  I hit a car from behind and I was going about 25 m p h and all I really had to replace was the radiator  My air bag did not go out but that might have been because of the angle I hit the car at  Neither my passenger or I was hurt at all  despite being thrown forward I like the interior of the car because it was very roomy and I could fit many people in there  The trunk is spacious and the only downfall to that is things can get lost easily in there  There was a dead spot in the steering wheel of about an inch in each direction  When my brakes did work  the anti lock system proved to be very effective  This car is affected by the wind a lot though  Perhaps not as much as a smaller car  but more than I would like a car of that size to  My rear view mirror has fallen off about four times one summer but that was the only summer that it did that  That is an easy fix though  My cup holder would stick a lot also  It was the type that would just push right into the dashboard  The change holder was very conveniently placed  right under the radio     
Neg, I have owned a 91 Ford Taurus since 1995  In that time  I have sunk nearly  5000 worth of repairs into it  including a transmission replacement  numerous brake jobs  and uncounted miscellaneous electrical and alignment based repairs  In its favor  it still runs after 146 000 miles  The air conditioning still works  However  nearly everything else does not  I bought the vehicle expecting reliability  good performance  and decent looks for the price  The looks are mostly intact  although the paint is scaling and flaking in spots  particularly on the top of the vehicle  I never got the reliability and performance has been decidedly spotty  The Taurus provides good acceleration  when the transmission is working  and reasonably good steering  although it doesn t corner very tightly  It does have a reasonably roomy interior  although we ve experienced major fading and cracking of the hard components such as the dash  The major problem with the vehicle  Anything that can fall part  frequently and expensively does  Currently  the gas gauge doesn t work  and whenever the weather is cold  the speedometer doesn t either  Consumer Reports lists the 91 Ford Taurus as a car to avoid  and I must agree  Buy the vehicle only if you can do your own repairs and don t mind lots of grease monkey time  if you don t know your way around a Chilton manual  forget this car     
Neg, We bought a 91 Taurus almost 2 years ago  It seemed to be in fairly good shape and drove well for a short time  The first sign of problems to come was the CV joints  After they were replaced  the brakes squealed BADLY even after the pads and shoes were replaced  Then the famous CHECK ENGINE light intermittently throughout the drive  But  saving the best for last  the notorious TRANSMISSION BUG has to be the best icon for the 91 Taurus they should condsider changing their logo  No downshifting on highway exits  no upshifting when entering a busy street spontaneous shifting up AND down while going down the street  Or MY personal favourite  the NO shifting  No up  down  sideways just no gear at all just a loud screaming transmission then a sudden neck cracking lurch into 2nd gear and on a related note  I have NO speedometer now thanks to the transmission  Currently relying on a radar detector to avoid tickets  lol But to be fair  I will say that  when I am not getting whip lash from the jerky transmission  which I can find NO mech to work on for less than twice what I paid for the car due to the  quot upgrades quot  ford made to the 91 model s transmissions  or wetting myself from the ever worsening loose steering  it IS a comfortable ride with lots of room front and back but in my opinion  a 10 speed bicycle would be a better deal br br  
Neg, I just got rid of this vehicle  My family bought it used in 1995 and it was my first car that I had driven from the moment I learned to drive until just a few weeks ago  During the time that I owned the vehicle the rotor cracked causing the wheel to fall off  luckily while moving slowly  The air conditioner went bad around 60K miles and never really worked again after several repairs  The transmission started failing before 100K and finally went out around 110K miles  I had the transmission replaced and it began to fail only 15K miles later  The water pump also went out and the brakes began to stick  Even though only the first rust spots were beginning to form on the vehicle  it felt as though it was only a matter of days before something else would go wrong  so I traded it in for a 2000 Pontiac Sunfire  Unfortunately  the dealer would only offer  450 for the trade in value because of its poor condition  This poor condition  after 127 000 miles was only the result of regular wear and tear and more than  5000 invested in repairs over the course of 5 years  If you are a regular mechanic and think you can get a bargain on this vehicle then go for it  but otherwise I would recommend steering clear br br  
Neg, My husband and I were needing a bigger car after our 2nd child was born  We wanted something larger than our civic so that we had room to grow and wouldn t have to buy another car for awhile We saw this beautiful burgandy Taurus  It had great features  It had only 17 000 miles on it  It had power windows  doors  steering  airbag etc  The interior was very clean also  It in a dark burgandy suede feeling like material  The dealership said that it had been a rental car in Hawaii  So we figured that maybe it was a pretty good car We wanted it really bad  It was a closeout and they were offering a pretty good deal on it  We ended up buying it and brought it home  After about a month or so  the air conditioner went out on it  My husband took it back to the auto store that we bought it from and they hesitantly fixed it  There were a few other weird things that went wrong with it  We decided to sell it  because we both thought that it would die on us any minute  My sister wanted to buy it from us  thinking that we were making up the weird things in our heads  We hesitantly sold it to her thinking that if something went wrong  she knew where we lived  etc  When we sold it to her  we had took the miles up to 23 000  She hadn t owned the car even two years  when she got stranded 200 miles from home  because the transmission went out on it  A year or so later  the engine went out on it  They ended up selling the car  It was a bad apple  They also ended up having to replace the struts on it  Now  I know that we weren t hard on the car  In fact  I really only drove it around town for errands  etc If you are smart  you will stay away from this year of Taurus  I don t know about the other years  but my husband and I have not had any desire to own another one br br  
Neg, Wow  Out of curiosity I started reading the Taurus reviews  They only confirmed my suspicions  I think the Taurus tends to be a lot like a cocker spaniel  If you know cockers you will find they come in good and bad  It seems they have two very different temperments  Laid back and affectionate would be type one  Nasty and very apt to bite is the second type  With the Taurus you have the dependable joy to drive car  and also  the  Found on Road Dead  type My  91 Taurus couldn t have been a better car for me  We did have a period of unreliability due to a bad alternator  It took 3 tries to get an alternator that would work for more than a day or two  but that can happen with any car  After that  it was clear sailing all the way  I really can t say too much bad about this car at all I bought this  91 Taurus in  95 from a dealer We paid  10 000 for a nicely loaded car  It had all the options I could have wanted  My favorite options being the automatic windows and seats have continued to work well  needing no repairs as of yet  Now that this car is almost 11 years old I couldn t really complain too much if things started to go although  I hope it continues to hold up for awhile  This is absolutely the most comfortable car I have ever driven  I am just under 5  tall and still I need not worry about sitting on a pillow or anything stupid like that  I have had that problem with other cars in the past  The automatic seats adjust all over the place making it easy to get a comfortable fit  Also  they are very easy to adjust even while driving  I like this because if you start to feel cramped  tired and uncomfortable you can just move a button or two and the change of position eases the discomfort right away The body of this car has held up well  We are very bad at keeping it washed and waxed and it is just now starting to show some rust  We are also very bad at managing to get the oil changes on time  Still the engine is doing fine  Nothing has really broken down on this car  We did have to replace the knobs recently that work all the heating and air conditioning settings  They just seemed to wear out and fall off a lot  The only really annoying thing we had a problem with is that the trunk had a tendency to pop open while you were driving down the highway  We did manage to correct that problem  Now  I feel safe and secure when driving this older car around  It has always been very reliable  I never had any problem with getting stuck anywhere due to a car problem As good as this car has been  I am starting to get a little worried  I do know a lot of people that have had nothing but trouble with the Taurus  and we are some of those people  We also have a  93 Taurus that I hate  It has been just as unreliable as the other one has been reliable  There is 160 000 miles on the Taurus I love and a lot less on the other car  It really shouldn t be in the condition it seems to be in  I have heard that they tend to die about the time you hit the 100 000 mark  I do know that several that have done that exact thing  I am beginning to get nervous about driving it because of the record of some of the others  I want to buy a new car soon  or a  new for me but slightly used  car  I would love to have another Taurus but because I keep hearing bad stories about the Taurus owned by others  I am leary of doing this  I must make up my mind soon  If I don t get another Taurus I plan to try to find a car as similiar as I can to the Taurus  It is the perfect size and shape for me  
Neg, You might be asking why I named my opinion  quot Turbo Pinto quot  Well as a high school graduation gift my father gave me his old 1991 Ford Taurus SHO  The car was purchased brand new in 1991  with every option you can think of  The color on the outside was white and the interior was black leather  The vehicle has 220 horsepower and it is a stick shift  In the two years that I drove the vehicle it has been repaired at least once a month  The repairs alone would cost more than  1000 and the mechanic would take up to a month to fix the problems  In the two years I owned the car my father spent out over  7000 fixing the problems  At this time I was just starting college and needed a reliable car to drive  my Taurus did not do its job  Problems I encountered the last time I drove the car were the temperature of the car was always hot due to the coolant holder always leaking  electrical system would malfunction during warm temperature days  the brakes sweaked profusly   my favorite one  the air conditioning system would only work for ten minutes and last but not least the factory stereo broke  I DO NOT recommend buying this car  it is a complete lemon  My Taurus deserves the title of TURBO PINTO  It is unreliable and will put you in the poor house by the amount of the repairs cost     
Neg, We bought a Ford Taurus a few years ago it was a 91  We bought it because it fit our family  Well when we bought it we had to replace the transmission and the paint on the hood was chipped  Now it is 2000 and it is already needing another transmission and the paint is really chipped off of the hood  The check engine light is always coming on and it stalls out on you  We have put so much money in this car  I am afraid to buy another ford taurus thinking that it will have the same problem after a few years br br  
Neg, I bought this car used from a dealer for  500  I thought that was an excellent price since the car was in perfect condition  I mean not a dent  scratch  spot on the interior  nothing  The guy said it needed a new head gasket so I thought with a mechanically inclined husband that was great  Well  we bought a gasket kit for  124 and did the job and sure enough the gasket was split  Well  how exciting the car is back together and ready to run for the first time  Won t start  Needs a new converter but that was OK because sometimes that could happen when you blow a gasket because of the antifreeze getting in there  Well  350 there  ready to run  Sounds little rough and doesn t shift properly  Had to fix transmission  gears broken  By doing that job we found broken rear motor mount  axles  cv joints  coolant lines   1672 completes this job  Once again ready to roll remind you I haven t yet got to drive the car  Runs rough and oil light comes on at idle  I need new bearrings and a crank shaft Currently I have only driven the car for little test rides after each job and now the car is sitting for sale in front of my house after  2646 and the cost of insurance and registration  etc  I refuse to do the job because at this I feel that if I do there will only be another problem lurking  All these problems and the car just now hit 100 000  I will never as long as I live  own a FORD car  
Neg, My little sister owns a 1991 Ford Taurus  and I ve got to admit it really sucks  Now  I m not trying to cut down Ford Motor Company in any way  I just think they can build a better car  This particular Taurus has a 3 4 L V6 that barely has a downshift  and couldn t go fast if your life depended on it  and I m talking about when it was brand new  Now  it s even worse  The suspension is too rough  the transmission shifts too hard  and the over all quality of the interior is just  well  tacky  Not only is it too plain  but it reminds me of something you would see in a 1970 Volkswagon Van  Now  I have to admit  the stereo and sound system are pretty good because I installed them myself so I know  I asked her if I could take it around town for a little while and see what it sounds like and see if I can get anyone to look and try to see where the music is coming from  People did look  well that s beside the point  While driving her car  I realized that it is just a pile of scrap metal on wheels  I don t know what the newer model Ford Taurus handles like  but this one can t and won t perform  I believe I have told you enough of about the piece of mobile junk  so I ll quit taking up your time  Thank you  that is all MAC   
Neg, No  I m not a princess But a few years ago  my parents decided to buy me a new car  Since they were trading in my Escort  they wanted to stick with a Ford product and I was ready to go for something a little bigger  with 4 doors A few days later  my brother appeared with a nifty new green 93 Tempo GL  4 doors  with almost all the bells and whistles  It was mine and then I discovered the fit  Even though the Tempo is bigger than the Escort there s less interior room  I felt stuffed like a sausage  Still  it was new  it was a gift  and gosh it had AC and power locks and an airbag I ve had it 7 years now it s strictly a train and back car so I ve only got 44K miles on it  In other words  it s likely to last forever  and it meets my needs  However  as a big person  this is absolutely the most uncomfortable car in the world  It requires amazing contortions to get in and out  and the wheel is right in my chest when I drive  I m only 5 5 quot  and even with the seat back  my legs overshoot the pedals Who did they design this for As for reliability  it s had its share of woes  The sparks went at 30K  So did the tires  It s had its share of buzzes and whirs  all requiring  400 600 treatments from my handy neighborhood mechanic  I put a new exhaust system on it at 35K  The battery has never really taken to winter If I could do it again  I d have taken another Escort  No offense  Mom and Dad  I can t wait to trade up br br  
Neg, I bought a  93 Ford Tempo 3 years ago for  3 000  Its A C didn t work and I haven t tried to repair it  When I bought it  it had  54 000 and now it has a little bit over  90 000  So far the biggest problem with it was the electrics  Cruise control would work  but if I went over a bump it would stop working  Windows go down and up at their will  I hate the brake  I have to put a lot of energy into stepping on it to reach the stopping point  I don t think that it s very stabile  The only thing that kind of makes me happy about owning this car is that it never had any major breakdown  It s engine works just fine  and I have taken it to several road trips  If you get annoyed by little things  then I guess you shouldn t buy this car because they break all the time  If you want to get something that will take you from the point A to the point B  than it s OK br br  
Neg, We have bought this car in Feb  2001 and kept for 9 months Because the car was really cheap  the car has been working satisfactorily  But the car requires maintenance every months causing minor problems here and there The car has 91 000 miles and we had to fix so far as follows the cost of labor includes  starter 227  front end   alternator 241  a hole in radiator 86    new radiator 125  a c not fixed yet    door lining tipping don t bother fixing them  This car has been teaching us how to maintain the car because it breaks down very often  
Neg, I own a 1993 Ford Tempo  Ever since I bought it I have had to do nothing but put money into it  The car was great for the first year or so and after that I ve been spending about  1000 a year in repairs  The tie rod design is very poor and they need to be replaced about every 30 000 miles  I had to put three alternators in it already  and the front end has given me lots of problems  This has been a very costly vehicle to own and I will never buy a Ford again  I ve had nothing but problems with mine and haven t heard anything good from anyone else about Fords  Unfortunately I can t afford to buy another car for a few years so I am stuck with this lemon for awhile if I don t go broke first     
Neg, Beginning around fall of 2000 I told people interested in buying a mid sized SUV that they should wait until a totally redesigned Explorer was introduced in January 2001  It ended up being delayed a couple of months  but in March it finally arrived  I promptly took one for a test drive and posted the following review on March 15  At the time there was no 2002 listing  When a 2002 listing appeared I reposted my review to its current location I ve never cared for the Explorer in the past  It was based on a very dated Ranger chassis designed in the early  80s  This showed in how it rode and handled  Like most SUVs  and nearly every American car thirty years ago  the Explorer used a body on frame construction  The Ranger based frame was far too flexible for such a heavy vehicle  Combined with soft body mounts  between the body and frame  used to help the ride  this resulted in a vehicle that shimmied and shuddered over even minor road imperfections  So why did I have high expectations for the new Explorer  The first one was thrown together in a hurry on a tight budget  No one at the time knew SUVs would turn out to be so hot  Now Ford knows  Even more than that  it knows that the Explorer is the best selling of the all  that this makes a huge amount of money for the corporation  and that the Japanese are finally waking up and fielding some top notch SUVs  Put all of this together  and Ford knew that its continued financial success depended on redesigning the Explorer so that it was the best  I d like to maintain the suspense as to whether or not the new Explorer met my expectations  But you ve most likely already seen that I gave it three stars and a  not recommended  so you ve probably already guessed that I was quite disappointed once I had the opportunity to drive one  But if you want to know why I was so disappointed  you ll have to read on   What s new for 2002  Why were my expectations so high for the new Explorer  In an acronym   IRS  No  certainly not the Internal Revenue Service  The other IRS  independent rear suspension  Truck based SUVs like the Explorer generally have a solid  or  live  rear axle  This means that the wheels are rigidly attached to the end of a solid metal tube that contains the heavy differential in the center  When you hit a bump with such a suspension  this entire heavy axle and wheel assembly absorbs the shock without the mediation of any springs or shock absorbers  Because so much mass is set in motion  it has a tendency to jostle the entire vehicle  it s a matter of simple physics  force equals mass times acceleration  To help absorb so much force  the springs and shocks have to be made softer  What s more  the solid beam transmits anything that happens to one wheel to the other wheel  So  all else being equal  a vehicle with a live rear axle usually handles and rides significantly worse than one with an independent suspension on all but perfectly smooth roads   With an independent suspension only the mass of a single wheel tire brake assembly is upset when one wheel hits a bump  So why don t SUVs simply have independent rear suspensions  Well  live axles are better for the sort of serious off road driving few SUV drivers actually do  This is why Jeep uses a live axle in front as well as in back in all of its vehicles  until the new Liberty comes out  Live axles also tend to be more durable when driven over rough terrain  Finally  and this is the most important thing for a company like Ford  they are very cheap and easy to manufacture  Take all of this together  and you might understand why I suddenly had such high expectations for the new Explorer when I learned that Ford was going with an independent rear suspension  Because an IRS is so much more expensive  I took this as a sign that Ford was doing whatever it takes to make the new Explorer have excellent on road ride and handling  This is after all the same company that only recently has made an IRS available on the Mustang  and even then only with the top of the line Cobra  Information that the all new frame would be far stiffer than the old one provided further evidence that this might be Ford s goal  I have now learned that Ford also had other benefits in mind  Namely  they wanted to open up space in the rear for a new feature  an optional third row seat  Going with an IRS made this seat possible  even though the new vehicle is just a tad larger on the outside than the old one  Sure  it is a cramped seat  much like those in the Acura MDX and Dodge Durango  but many people want a third seat for kids  and for them it should do just fine  Going with an IRS also allowed for the amount of cargo room to be substantially increased and for the cargo floor to be significantly lower  Anyone who has had to put a lot of stuff into an SUV will probably realize the significance of that last improvement  Some other improvements are worth mentioning  In the powertrain department  the 210 horse OHC six is largely carried over  while a 240 horse eight is new  The latter replaces the venerable 302  which saw its final duty in the Explorer  The new eight is based on the base engine in the Expedition  but has an aluminum block to save weight  While the old eight was paired with a four speed automatic  the new one is paired with the five speed that only the OHC six came with before  The extra gear is between first and the former second  This should improve acceleration beyond first gear  since RPM will not drop as much after the shift  keeping the engine in its powerband  The eight is a  695 option  Are the extra thirty horsepower necessary enough to be worth this much money  Read on  Styling is not among the major changes  Most people probably won t even notice that the styling has changed  That said  the new design has sharper creases than the old  lending it a more upscale appearance  The Mercury Mountaineer  the Explorer s twin  has more unique styling than in the past  with a front end that people are likely to either love or hate  Personally  I prefer the classic styling of the Ford  I admire what they have tried to do with the Mercury  the trendy brushed metal thing  but don t feel they have quite pulled it off   Accommodations and amenities  With the above knowledge  I took a trip to the Ford dealer  Things started to go wrong as soon as I hopped into the driver s seat  You sit high  Too high  I got in  and the sunvisor was just barely above my line of sight and it was up  And I m not a tall person  only 5 9  Hmmm is the seat all the way up  I hunted for a power seat button  and found a rotary knob that adjusts the lumbar in and out instead  Was there no power seat in this vehicle  I figured there had to be  I was sitting so high  Somehow my hand found it s way between the adjusters for the lumbar support and the recliner and found the control for the power seat way down there somewhere  The seat was up  but only about an inch  Even in the lowest position I was sitting too high relative to the windshield header for my personal taste  The dash is quite low  providing excellent visibility forward  The seat could be lower and still leave the driver well above the top of the dash  Why isn t it  Beats me  Or why didn t they simply extend the windshield higher  the top of the roof is well above the top of the windshield  Again  I haven t a clue  Maybe I m unique in liking the windshield header well outside my line of sight  I don t know  I certainly don t like having it so low  It s like having a baseball cap on all the time  I don t like that either but maybe the market for these trucks does  Somehow I doubt that was the logic involved  Aside from the header issue  front seat comfort is OK  They provide an average level of back support  Nothing to write home about  good or bad  in terms of comfort  They could look nicer  though  The fairly small cushion with a rounded front edge just looks econocar ish  The rear seat raises even more questions than that low header high seat in front  In the new vehicle there s more room back there  enough to fit a very comfortable seat at a very comfortable height  As it is  the height of the cushion is about average  which is to say just a bit too low to adequately support the thighs of someone my height  Few vehicles do have a sufficiently high rear seat cushion  so I can t complain too much about this in the Explorer  I can and will complain a lot about the height of the rear seatback  It s really low  as if it was designed for small children  So low that when the headrests are down all the way they press into the upper part of my back  This is actually more comfortable than you would expect  Felt kinda nice having them there  The problem is that in this position the headrest provides zero whiplash protection  I couldn t raise the headrest because the seat had the plastic on it still and I didn t want to be the one to remove it  I assume you can raise it about a foot  as crazy as that sounds  because otherwise the rear seat would be unsafe for tall people  At the same time  I doubt many people will raise the rear headrests so much  most people leave them all the way down for aesthetics and driver visibility  So this seat seems unsafe to me given how most people will configure it  And hard for adults to nap in on trips  A final safety detail  the center belt is lap only  The spec sheet touts all of the stuff Ford has done for safety in the new design  including all sorts of airbags  This makes it all the more surprising that they blew the most basic safety stuff  Why did Ford make the rear seatback so low  I suspect it has something to do with the low cargo floor I mentioned earlier  This is great for loading cargo  But it means the second row seat has to fold that much lower to form a flat floor  which forces the seatback to be smaller  This is my hypothesis at least  I didn t fold the seat down  so I haven t tested it  Ford does provide two levels of vents for rear passengers  with a switch to select between them  This is nice  but some of the competition  namely GM  is now doing far more for rear passengers  Ford did do an excellent job with the cargo area  It s large  usefully shaped  well finished  and very easy to access  First  there s that low floor  so you don t have to lift stuff as high as you do with other truck based SUVs to load it  Then  there is the matter of the liftglass  It is nice to be able to open the rear glass without opening the entire tailgate if all you have to do is throw in a shopping bag or two  The problem is that SUVs tend to be so high off the ground that it s not always easy to throw something in through the glass  With the new Explorer  Ford has addressed this problem by having some of the door open with the glass  so that it is like a door within a door  This reduces the liftover to a very manageable height  The XLT I drove was about halfway between the base vehicle and the top of the line Limited  It had your basic amenities such as power driver s seat height adjuster  power windows  cruise  etc  but no more  Nothing you won t find in your typical Taurus from Hertz  At a price of  31 265  perhaps this is all I should expect  After all  if I want more stuff there is always the Eddie Bauer or Limited  and whatever options are available on them  Except no matter how much you load onto the new Explorer  it s going to still feel cheap  It s a matter of the interior materials  They look durable enough  so I guess  cheap  really the right word  But they look durable like materials designed for heavy duty commercial use do  This interior looks like it was designed for a work truck  not one often used as a family vehicle  not to mention one bought more and more as a luxury vehicle  The styling of the interior reinforces this impression  It s a very plain  very functional design  Like with so many aspects of this vehicle  nothing to write home about  good or bad  Except that it s not good  which if you want good is bad   On the road  As many faults as I found with the new Explorer before even driving it  they might have been forgotten if the vehicle delivered in the ride and handling department  After all  that s what I was really looking forward to trying out in the first place  So how well did the impressive spec sheet translate to the real world  Not well at all  I was sorely disappointed  Even in moderate turns  I didn t attempt any aggressive maneuvers  the new Explorer leans heavily and plows  Heavy understeer  The steering is fairly decent for an SUV it s only a bit on the light side for my tastes but there s just no joy to be had here  IRS or no  this truck remains a sloppy handler  The sole bright spot in the handling is a very tight turning circle for such a large vehicle  I wish my compact car turned this sharply  And it s not just that the springs and shock valving are too soft  Handling has not simply been sacrificed for ride quality  Fairly minor imperfections in the road surface made the entire vehicle quiver  I suspect the body on frame construction has something to do with this  The old Explorer seemed to have soft body mounts to help the ride  with the result that the body would shimmy on the frame over bumps  Though the new truck is definitely an improvement  it seems this trait has been carried over  Very sad  Worse  every bump sends a shudder up through the steering column  I like to be able to feel the road through the wheel  but at some point road feel becomes  kick back  Don t get me wrong  the ride is generally comfortable  These problems may even be most noticeable at low speeds over minor to moderate road imperfections  But all of this shimmying and shuddering makes the new Explorer feel far less solid than the stats on the new body and frame suggest it should be  These sensations say  work truck  not  family vehicle  and definitely not  luxury  The main quality lapse I noticed in the vehicle I drove was a minor squeak in the dash around the instruments  There may be other problems lurking  The launch of the new vehicle was delayed about six weeks to fix lingering quality issues  Overall I suspect quality will be about the same as with the old Explorer  which is to say about average  maybe a touch below average  On the sparsely populated positive side of the ledger  the new Explorer is fairly quiet  In contrast to the smaller Escape  road noise is especially low  I had to strain to hear the tires  which for the record were Michelins  Wind noise is moderate even at highway speeds  Unfortunately  more bad news is not far away  The six is just barely up to moving this much vehicle  Thankfully Ford added a gear between first and what used to be second a few years ago  so that once the transmission does shift you remain in the engines powerband  I never felt like the engine was letting me down I could accelerate as quickly as I d want to in regular driving but the engine makes a lot of noise while going about its work  It s not an entirely unpleasant sound I ve certainly heard nastier sounds coming from engines  But it always seems like the engine is working quite hard  if not quite straining  In regular driving  using about 1 3 throttle to accelerate  the transmission shifted at about 4000 RPM  This is a fairly high shift point for regular driving  A bit more throttle  and the tranny shifts at 5000 you get the idea  So while this engine moves the vehicle well enough  I suspect fuel economy will be very poor  High shift points will do that  All in all  between the suspension and the just adequate engine the new Explorer was not at all fun to drive  Maybe SUV buyers don t expect their vehicles to be fun to drive  I personally do  so this alone would be a deal killer for me  The eight will not be available for another month or two  I might test drive a V8 Limited once one is available  I don t expect the difference to be large enough to sway my basic opinion of the vehicle  but there is always that chance  Update  9 19 2001  I recently drove a Mercury Mountaineer with the 240 horsepower V8 and leather  The eight performed only marginally better than the six  It lacked the torquey feel engines of this size usually have  As with the six  even half throttle resulted in 4 000 5 000 RPM shifts  This engine should not have to work this hard  I have no idea why it does  At any rate  the six in the GM SUVs performs much better than Ford s eight  The Mercury s two tone leather made for a more luxurious interior  but parts such as the console detracted from the ambiance I did not do any off road driving  Given the on road experience  I do not expect this is a good vehicle for serious off road driving  The suspension is too soft  the handling too clumsy  and the vehicle is just too big for that sort of thing  Of course few people use Explorers this way  For light duty SUV stuff  like driving on snow or unpaved roads  it should be adequate   Last words  Ford has a lot at stake with the new Explorer  From the spec sheet it appears they went all out to guarantee that the Explorer will continue to be the best selling SUV  The inclusion of an independent rear suspension is especially impressive  Unfortunately  while the size and utility of the cargo area is exceptional  the new Explorer surprisingly falls short in many other areas  This fact was highlighted by my second test drive of the day  GM has also just introduced totally redesigned versions of its mid sized SUVs  There s no IRS  there s no available third row seat  at least not yet  and GM has fallen short so often in the past that I didn t expect nearly as much from these new vehicles  Once again a test drive surprised me  this time in a good way  For details  check out my review of the GMC Envoy  Though the GMC stickered for quite a bit more than the Ford  I suspect that they cost about the same comparably equipped   Once comprehensive pricing information is available I will update this part of the review  As for Ford  I d advise a bunch of quick revisions to the new Explorer  Otherwise  they can kiss their market leadership goodbye  A mediocre SUV was good enough in the past  But the competition is not staying still  so mediocre just isn t going to cut it much longer  
Neg, Ford Explorer has taken a lot of heat in the media of late It is a great product and has been the mainstay of the Ford line for a few years now  From time to time Ford has tried some improvements  With the media after them relative to roll overs and Firestone tires  I guess this was the time to really give Explorer a new look There was a problem finding stashing places  Where do you put the maps and the pocketbook and the wrench and those little items most of us carry around with us When I got in for a test drive the salesman pointed to the door and said here is the spot for your water bottle  Well  my fifty something neighbor down the street never leaves home without her bottle  I must be the camel in the neighborhood  I was not impressed  Unfortunately I discovered that little curve meant I had less leg room  The caddy in the center console has a crazy useless configuration in my 2000 Ford Explorer  There is a definite improvement in the stashing capability in the redesigned console  But then the seat is smaller  Since 2000 my butt has gotten bigger and the Ford Explorer seats have gotten smaller  That is where all the hidden space has come from They have a car like riding truck  I had no complaints with the old ride  But now my mother in law will not have to be hosted up into the passenger seat  The Explorer is closer to the ground BUT my husband cannot ride in the front seat  The height clearance inside the cabin is lower  He hits his head and the man is only over six foot not seven foot The Explorer is wider on the outside  but not on the inside  With narrower  smaller seats all those stashing places are useless  I cannot fit comfortably inside with all my stuff By the way there are also extra seats in the back  Great for car pooling  That is if the members of the car pool are kids  It is not seating for adults  There is no leg room  You have to climb in like a amusement park ride to get back there  I would never ask an adult to do so  especially if I was picking the crew up at the airport The ride is great and I am sure the reliablity is as good The visibility out the front window is also affected if you are an average sized person  
Neg, I get a new Windstar LX as a company vehicle every year and I am disappointed by the lack of quality in this 2002 model  This is compared to previous Windstars  not to other makes and models  This van was made at the Oakville Ontario plant This is a minivan  not an expensive sports car  With that in mind here are my observations Ride  smooth and comfortable except for the out of round wheels and tires on this particular van making it vibrate at highway speeds  Handling  this is a minivan and it handles like one would expect it to  At high speeds  over 60  it doesn t like to go straight without constant steering corrections  At really high speeds  over 85  it can be tiring to drive as you are trying even harder to keep it in your lane  Maybe this is how all minivans are  I can only compare it to our Town Car which drives fine at ultralegal speeds Acceleration  quite good  This van has the 3 8 engine and has adequate power  The 2002 model doesn t seem to blast from 0 60 like the 2001 did  Maybe they changed the gear ratios  It s still pretty good though Transmission  not bad  Shifts smoothly and usually picks the right gear for the conditions  Much better than some other Fords I have driven although not as good as GM s I have driven  Brakes  seem fine to me  The pedal pressure is just right and the van seems to slow and stop just fine Noise  generally a pretty quiet vehicle  The engine makes quite a bit of noise at full bore as compared to other vehicles but it is noticeably quieter than the 1999 model I had several years ago  Interior  The front seats are great  I ve never used the back seats  one of them is in my garage unused  so I can t attest to their comfort  The kids haven t complained though  The back seats are the full width ones and are very heavy  One person can remove and install them if you want a backache so I always get someone to help me move the seats  I think other companies have done a better job at designing the seating on their vehicles Reliability  so far so good  Hasn t broken down yet  In previous years I have not had to do any repairs to my Windstars  just normal scheduled maintenance Quality  WHAT HAPPENED  This one has both front doors and the right sliding door and the rear hatch door all squeaking in unison as I drive down the road  Two wheels are out of round which causes vibrations at highway speeds making everything that isn t adjusted properly shake and squeak  I can see that the rear hatch door and the right sliding door are not adjusted properly and do not close tightly against the weatherstrip  The front suspension makes squeaking and grunting noises at low speeds  This is probably not a design flaw but an assembly goof  I would accept these flaws from a 10 year old vehicle with lots of miles on it but from a new vehicle  None of my previous Windstars were this poorly assembled  BTW  this is the first Windstar I ve had with the stamped  el cheapo wheels  the kind that need full wheelcovers on them  In previous years the wheels were the cast aluminum one piece  no wheelcover  wheels and they were fine  
Neg, I recently received a new 2002 Ford Windstar as a company vehicle  I have to say that this was an extremely bad choice  First off  the body styling is very boring compared to the rest of the mini vans on the market  The nose is long  the body is a box  and there are no accent lines to  spruce  it up  The interior is equally as boring  except maybe for the CD player  The rear seats are bench style and not bucket style as was in my Chevy Venture  This makes it difficult to get in and out  even for the smallest person  When removing the seats  you have to take the whole bench out  instead of simply one seat which is a headache because of the weight  I doubt that a mother of three could attempt such a feat  The space in the rear behind the last bench seat is non existent  I m not sure why it even exists actually  Should have eliminated the space  and backed the seats up a little bit for more leg room  If pushed  the engine is loud and sounds like its going to explode as it sucks down the 20 gallon gas tank in a matter of 350 miles  The ride is not bad  but the stereotype of driving a boat is in full force here  The transmission is a little choppy for a new vehicle  Can t imagine what it will be like at 50 000 miles  Ford was never known for their transmissions in the first place  The steering column seems to be a little off center in relation to the drivers seat due to the dash board design  The only pro I can see only applies to myself  and that is that it is a free vehicle for me  Unfortunately to all of you  you ll have to shell out 29 grand for this beauty  Do yourself a favor and shop around  I guarantee you ll find a better selection at a different dealer  
Neg, My wife leased a 1999 Ford explorer January 1999 It has been a nightmare ever since First problem was with the transmission  It started leaking 1 month after we got it  They decided a new seal was in order  It went back to the shop a total of three times before they figured that the transmission was defective  Then came the recalls  one for the cruise control then the front hood latch then for a defective windshield washer which would come on intermittently  To this day we are still having problems with it Now the airbag light stays on and the rear windshield washer refuses to work  we had another problem with the check engine light This is our first Ford vehicle and quite possibly our last In the early day Fords were ok  but now the quality has suffered br br  
Neg, I bought my 1999 Ford Explorer in April of 1999 factory ordered  Since then I have had approx  15 recalls  That is annoying when I have to keep taking it back to the dealer to have something fixed  I have put 16 000 miles on it and have had it in the dealer shop six times for repairs  from fixing a window to the windshield washer and wipers not working  I had to get new tires because of the Firestone suit  When I went to change the new tires  I had to pay for it up front  which was more than  300 00 I had to borrow  I was reimbursed within ninety days  Cutting corners has about given me a heart attack on several occasions  I m not the best driver  but the potential for my Explorer to flip over on a tight corner is high I m not totally against my Ford Explorer  it s roomy  comfortable  seats five people legally  It has plenty of space in the back for traveling  Safety rods that run across the back space  I use the rod to secure my groceries  Air conditioning  a cassette radio  I asked for a CD player and never received one  I also asked for running boards  didn t receive them  Gold trim  got Black trim instead  I m finished experimenting with SUV S  Next time I think I ll buy a Mercedes  Maybe it s the dealer to blame  but all those recalls  I say something was made wrong  
Neg, My first stop for car shopping was Toyota  due to my previous experience for reliability  The mini van was too mommish  amp  the SUV ceiling seem low  floor board high I then went to Ford  because I liked the look of their SUV  enough room for 2 young kids  amp  all the consumer magazines gave it overall good ratings  After one week  3 different ford dealerships  amp  more than eighty percent for a down payment  I should ve taken this as a sign Once I finally purchased my 1999 Ford Explorer XLT  I really loved it  I had the few options that were important to me  the fleet representative was very nice  the finance was within budget  amp  the insurance didn t dent my pocket Well  I was into month 5 8000 miles of owning this vehicle  when I notice the transmission starting to slip  I took the car to the dealer for a recall issue  amp  mention the trany slips  of course the repair gentleman thought I didn t know what I was talking about  It wound up the cylinoid bracket was a factory default  The parts had to be ordered  amp  should be in within a couple of days  I was covered for car rental for 5 days  but it didn t pay for the insurance  Week one goes by  amp  no call from the service dept  I had to contact them  because the rental was only covered for 7 days  The parts were still not in  amp  Ford then had to place me in one of their rentals  A ford Taurus  OK  I should say  thank you  they gave me something new The rental agreement was for  5 a day   1200 max coverage  Everyone knows  1500 probably wouldn t cover a dented bumper  After numerous phone calls to the service dept  claiming the parts hadn t arrive yet  I call their service mgr  who never returned any of my calls  so I had to go a step further I then mailed a certified letter to ford informing them of this issue  amp  letting them know I was aware of the  lemon law  I also sent written notifications to the California Consumer affairs  cartalk com  better business bureau  amp  other consumer advocates  such as those we see on TV By day 30 of having my car in the shop  amp  23 days of rental on a ford taurus  the service dept calls me  informing me my car is ready how convenient  day 31 would ve qualified me for the lemon law The gentlemen in the service dept who kept in touch with me regarding my car stated that I caused some problems for them  Oh  did I mention that particular Service Mgr was no longer at that dealership This incident left me with nothing good to say about ford  If they had told me after week one  my car would ve been in the repair shop for a month  I would ve known what to expect  temporary insurance change  so I could feel safer about driving their vehicle if nothing else Ford did cover my rental expenses  and my car seems to run OK  but I plan on trading it in before the extended warranty runs out or I pay it off  I don t want to end up like BeccaM  Now  I know why I haven t owned an american car within the last 20 years  Next time i ll go with what I know Toyota  I wouldn t recommend my worse enemy to purchase a ford I ve only owned 3 brand new cars and this was the first to give me problems within my first 100 000 miles  Usually  they fall apart after the warranty has expired or you ve paid it off After reading all the positive epinions of Explorer owners  looks like I ended up with a  quot LEMON quot br br  
Neg, One year ago driving by my local ford dealership I noticed a sharp looking SUV  So I turned around and took it for a test drive  Pleased with the price and the way it looked I traded vehicles  I was very pleased with the way it drives for the first week  then came rain  Having owned two SUVs before this one and had no problems driving during bad weather  Well it was a different story for the explorer  IT S VERY HARD TO HANDLE ON A WET ROAD  And if the wind is blowing hard you might as well pull over  Besides driving during bad weather I have been haunted with recall letters I think i have had 4 so far and i am sure there will be more soon  Now lets talk about ford quality parts that the explorer is made of  5 months after the impulse buy that I made several parts STOP working first thing to go was the back windshield wiper  well it works when it wants to not when I need it to  Then my fog lights  ground lights  work when its warm  haven t figured that one out yet Nor has the dealer  any suggestions  Also when I turn on the turn left signal my wipers come on and then go off  I m no expert when it comes to wiring but is this not a short in the electrical system  now the cigarette lighter does not work   there are many other small things about the explorer I don t like but I guess that s what I get for IMPULSE BUYING  And after going through all of this in less than a years time   I would NOT recommend the 99 explorer sport to ANYONE     
Neg, The only title the Explorer can lay claim to is the best selling SUV in America  It certainly can t call itself the most powerful  the best looking  or the best handling  In a nation where the Camry outsells any car  the best selling SUV title may not be so glamorous  And the facts will back that up The base engine in an Explorer is a little 4 0 liter 160 horsepower deal left over from the early Explorer days  Coupled to a manual transmission  this engine is slow  sluggish  and a good choice  Seem paradoxical  Consider this  The next level up is 4 0 liter V6 with 50 more horsepower  Yet it is not a big step up for the money  0 60 figures improve by only  3 seconds and quarter mile times by  2  Still not convinced the base engine is the way to go  Consider the top level engine  It is a 5 0 liter V8 with  scoff  2 valves per cylinder  Given a whole extra liter of displacement and 2 more cylinders to work with  the engine only gains 5 horsepower from the next step down  Most surprisingly however  0 60 in a V8 Explorer will take you 9 seconds  as opposed to 8 7 in the considerably cheaper base model  I m almost always a fan of a bigger engine  but in this case  I say save your money  Why shell out more for an 2 valve cylinder V8 that only goes slower than the base  and has 14 miles per gallon  quot efficiency quot   note  the V8 carries more torque  so if you need to haul something  e g  a boat  you might consider it  but for hauling kids  keep your money Roadholding in an Explorer is characteristic of an SUV  That is  a lot of body roll  a lot of bounce  and a generally uncomfortable ride  Again  the base model shows its true colors  with a skidpad reading of  73g  opposed to only  70g for the V8  Likewise  suspension is nothing revolutionary  It is a step up from the Ranger pickup that it s based on  but still bouncy  On the plus side  the Explorer is safe  given its standard airbags and disc brakes  but please stay away from Firestone Wilderness A T s  It is also roomy  accommodating 4 people well  4 people who are not susceptible to motion sickness  and 5 people for short hops br br  
Neg, I own a 99 new Ford Explorer Sport for about a year  I already had 3 warranty repairs and that s a brand new car  After 6 weeks the ABS module broke which also caused the odometer and the speedometer to fail  It took my dealer 4 visits to figure out that the ABS module was the problem  A couple of weeks later one of the rear safety belts broke and last week the motor of the rear end wiper died  Then there is still that rattling noise close to the moonroof which no dealer was able to find the cause of  Also there were two recalls by Ford  After getting that fixed  suddenly my wiper come on whenever I turned or gave a turning signal  This has stopped as suddenly as it appeared  Maybe I got an especially bad assembled car  but it makes one wonder about the quality assurance at Ford The Explorer Sport is a really nice car if two people are riding in the car  To get to the back seat is kind of hard  The cargo space and room that the Explorer provides is great  It is easy to load big stuff into it  I have the Comfort Package with the 6 way power driver s seat which is really great if two people of different height use the car  It is very easy to adjust the seat and it provides a lot of  quot fine tuning quot  of your seat s position For the looks of the car I would definitely recommend the Premium Sports Package Driving the Explorer on a bumpy road is like riding a camel  very shaky  When turning on wet streets the rear end of the car is skidding which doesn t make you feel very safe in it  When making longer road trips on a highway it is a very comfortable  nice to drive car  I still love my Explorer  sometimes it s a love hate relationship  but I would not buy one anymore nor would I recommend it to anyone br br  
Neg, My wife loves the Explorer but she is 5 5 quot  tall  I m 6 2 quot  and this vehicle is not made for people our height  We had an XLT for 3 years and upgraded to an Eddied Bauer with a sunroof  Big mistake for me because I can t sit straight up  Also  when will Ford learn to place their rearview mirror higher up on the windshield  I think they are the only manufacturer that still mounts the mirror to the windshield so it s right in the way  Also  the seats do not have ANY head restraints for somebody over 6  tall  I m surprised FORD has not gotten dinged for this  The Limited version has this option but this is not the standard model Overall  my wife loves it so we re stuck with it but I do not recommend it to a person with above average height br br  
Neg, I loved my  99 Explorer XLT for the first 2 months  Then we went back and bought the SUV we d originally intended to buy  the  99 Expedition  There are 3 main reasons why I traded up to the  99 Expedition Eddie Bauer  drivers seat comfort  cargo space  and highway noise  I began to realize that my back really was hurting every day and suddenly it dawned on me that my beloved new SUV was the culprit  I was driving about 70 miles a day  quite a haul I agree  but I had never experienced back pains like this after driving  The driver s seat is not comfortable for a 135 pound woman  Even with all the ergonomic gadgets adjusted  the pain was still there  As I had previously owned a compact  the Explorer was huge at first  Then I realized something  There s not as much cargo space as the brochures lead you to believe  If you re a mom like me  a lot of  quot stuff quot  gets carted around daily  Strollers  car seat  diaper bag  etc  Add groceries or plants from the nursery and there is no room for folks  My mother and father could not ride comfortably in the backseat during a visit  even without all the junk  and this was frustrating for everyone On the highway  we found ourselves turning the radio up higher only to notice that on regular streets  we were blasting ourselves  There is a lot of outside noise in the Explorer  much less than the Expedition So  we made a painful decision  Take the loss and get another SUV that will really fit our needs  We ve owned the Expedition for a month now and LOVE everything about it except the locks that lock automatically when you step on the brake  seems pretty cool until you realize how often the passenger hops in and out getting mail  checking on baby one last time  fetching diaper from back  etc  and I m still working on getting into a parking place on the first try but that s another story br br  
Neg, We purchased our 1998 Ford Contour Sport GL with a 16 valve  4 cylinder engine in October of 1999  What attracted us to this vehicle  It was nearly new  it was in our price range and it was a pretty blue color  In addition  all of the literature that we read about the 1998 Contour was very positive  Performance  handling  and fuel economy were highlights of reviews  From what we read in the  Lemon Aid  book  the car represented excellent value for money  However  having lived with the car for the past 12 months  I m not so sure that all of the press that the 1998 Contour received was entirely accurate  I think this car would have rated as above average within its class  but my problem with this vehicle is a lack of confidence in its quality and safety  I will address all of the realities of the Contour  both good and bad  including the numerous recalls  and hopefully you will be able to better make your decision I would like to begin with commenting on all of the great things about the 1998 Ford Contour  First  this thing handles corners like nobody s business  It hugs those bends and turns  and what that translates to is a solid  secure feeling through the car and steering wheel  Who doesn t like to feel confident of the way their car handles  This vehicle is definitely above average in this regard  and this feature is possibly my number one favorite in the 1998 Contour Next good thing about the 1998 Ford Contour is its acceleration abilities  It does really well getting up to speed in good time  Whether merging on the highway or zipping in and out of traffic in town  this car can meet your requirements  I feel that this is important to note  as several people will shy away from a 4 cylinder as it feels like you re driving a turtle  I m sure the 6 cylinder just flies by comparison  but the 4 cylinder is far from disappointing in this regard  Lastly  our Contour is absolutely great on gas  We get excellent mileage  I m certain this is due largely to the fact that this is a 4 cylinder vehicle  and given the prices of fuel these days  this is definitely a  BIG  plus  Now  I have seen reviews that differ on this point  but they do not say if they are the 4 cylinder vehicle or the 6 cylinder  We had some diagnostics done earlier this year  and the results determined that we get about 13 5 kilometers to 1 liter of gas  Things could be very different for the 6 cylinder Contour  but if you are looking for an economical vehicle to operate  consider this vehicle an option  Now  onto other matters  Yes  the Ford Contour definitely has a dark side  Since we have owned the car  there have been 2 recalls  One to adjust the wiring for the airbags to ensure that they actually do go off when needed  and one to readjust something with the rear brakes so that they would not seize in an emergency  I know of one other recall to do with the headlights  but we asked our dealer and apparently that problem was resolved with our vehicle with the previous owner  So  well  there have been at least three recalls  Let s face it recalls are a little inconvenient  but stuff gets fixed for free  so who cares  right  Well  let me ask you this does the number of recalls reflect the quality of the vehicle overall  I think it does  As a result  I m not entirely confident of the quality of the vehicle  What else is looming in the future  Will be get the next recall notice  or will we be in an accident that leads to the next recall Which leads me to my big issue with the Ford Contour  and with Ford itself  Last Saturday morning as we were zipping along the highway  my husband and I immediately noticed a very strong burning smell  My husband is a diesel mechanic  and he said it smelled like burning wiring  All of a sudden   light gray smoke  starts pouring from the glove compartment and dashboard  My husband pulls over immediately  and we haul the kids out of the car in record time  My husband then opens the passenger door  pulls down the dash panel  and rips out the offending article  A plastic three way switch and the plugs that had been in it were totally fried  resulting in the wiring burning and the plastic socket burnt and melted  Fortunately  the car is determined still operable  and we are able to drive it to our dealership When my husband relates the tale to the woman at Ford  she is very understanding and sympathetic  She even goes so far as to tell us that she knows the exact problem they ve seen   quite a few b  She tells us that the problem will be fixed free of charge  We ask her   If this is such a common problem  then why hasn t there been a recall on the car  She then told us that usually something else goes before the problem gets as serious as this  so when the customer complains of the other problem  they fix the entire thing gratis  Ford has not determined the need for a recall as of yet  She must have noticed the stunned look on our faces  because she quickly said  But no one should have went through something like this  Hmmm you know  I think she s right   No one  should have to go through this experience  but people have  Quite a few people  apparently  So why hasn t Ford issued a recall to prevent another  possibly more serious incident from happening  Maybe this is like the Freestone Tire issue there has to be a certain death toll to make results happen  In conclusion  we had previously considered the 1998 Ford Contour a really good car  We liked it  We truly did  To me  it was a good car that handled well  had a peppy four cylinder engine  and was an economical drive  But now we have to ask ourselves b Do we have confidence in this car s quality and safety standards b  The answer is a resounding   No b  Frankly  I have also lost a lot of respect and confidence in The Ford Motor Company as well  I can t recommend this vehicle to others in all conscience  despite our previous level of content with this car  as their are just too many uncertanties and questions surrounding the safety and quality of this vehicle     
Neg,  NO ONE b b Introduction  What was Ford thinking when they designed a four door car that is capable of 143 mph Obviously  when their fastest Sedan is just as fast as their mid sized engine sports car  they ve done something wrong  The designers of the Contour should have looked less at the engine and suspension and more towards comfort  interior  exterior  airbags  headlights  While the designers of the Mustang should have at least tried to compete with Chevy s race oriented cars b Pros  Ford knows how to do paint  it has a beautiful paint job If the headlights didn t explode  they put out adequate light  and the fog lights work good for daytime I guess for a mid priced sedan  this thing moves pretty well  0 60 in 12 seconds  Its agile too  with very little body flex in sharp turns If you really want one  resale sucks  so you ll be able to get a fully loaded 1998 model for  10 000 Ok  that is it for the pros b Cons  The headlights and airbags were recalled  The headlights explode  The airbags  won t go off in a crash   The cruise control will get stuck on   resulting in a crash   The throttle cable may fray  not returning to idle position   resulting in a crash   The rear brakes may lock up and refuse to unlock   resulting in a crash   If you own one of these cars  take it to the dealer immediately to get these things repaired  Thats only the first two years ownership  god knows what will happen when Ford quits recalling and they start exploding like Pinto s On cold mornings  sometimes this car refuses to start  Battery problem  sensor problem  I don t know  It starts fine when it is warm b It seats no one comfortably   maybe people who stand five feet tall and below  on a recent trip with four adults  each and every one complained of being cramped  The seats are almost comfortable  maybe if there was more leg room  they d be bearable The dash board is a joke  I m used to dash boards where you can put things  this one is sloped towards the front seats  and anything and everything placed on the dash board will eventually fall  This is so the airbags don t throw anything into you if they go off  But don t worry about it  they  won t go off  Ford has to stop trying to make their cars and components look like their emblem  Ovals do not make for good climate controls  nor do they flatter the exterior of this car b Road noise is terrible   Vibrations at freeway speeds are horrible  never mind trying to go faster than that  it feels as if the entire car is going to fall apart  After an alignment  it got a little better  but didn t go completely away To change the oil  you must drain it directly onto an exhaust manifold  which  of course  smells very bad until it all gets cooked off  The muffler is welded to the frame  which will make any replacement expensive  The radio antenna is motorized  which makes for a nice  clean look  but once that servo goes and you know it will  it will be a pain in the butt to replace  or it can probably be rigged so that it is always up  since the CD player won t even work unless the antenna is up The gas mileage averages at  25 mpg   with a  2 5 Liter engine   that is obviously ridiculous  a friend with a 1997 Sebring has the same size engine  and averages 33 mpg  on occasion getting as high as 36 b Overall  This car has been deeply effected by the  quot b Driver Returns On Foot  quot  syndrome  it is about time Ford removed it from their line up  It was nothing but trouble the day it came off the assembly line  The model I speak of was a  1998   which is a  refined version   I would have hated to see a 1997 or before model of this car  they probably have a lower life expectancy than the Mustangs at 2 5 years If you really want a family car with some pep  get the Impala SS or an SUV with a 4300 Vortec which will keep up just as well and afford better gas mileage If you really want one and are set on getting it no matter how bad it is  e mail me and I ll pray for you br br  
Neg, First of all I have to say that the Ford Contour is a very comfortable vehicle and is a great family car  My fiancee and I own a Ford Contour currently and it gets us where we need to go  It is a pretty dependable car  The engine runs great and we have not had any under the hood work in a year  The problem however is the axles and the tires  The axles are weak and if not aligned just right the tires where extremely fast  I would have to recommend the car for familys but not for single young people with higher chances of accidents etc  Once alignment is gone or anything happens then the cash starts pouring out of the pockets  Something else is that the car looses value quickly  Not a good investment if planning on selling it  I do believe that the car would run forever if taken care of but once the miles get on it then be prepared to loose some money  Believe me  I know  Well  the sum it all up it is very roomy  great engine  and great gas mileage  But on the contrary it depreciates quickly and often requires alot of body work  But we all have our own opinions don t we br br  
Neg, I originally bought a new 1998 Ford Contour A month after I got it I was not all that thrilled with it Before I bought it I had a Ford Escort in which I had no problems with for four years The reason I bought the contour is because I wanted a car that was more comfortable and bigger The reason that I would not buy this car again is because they did not make the gas tanks very well At most gas stations I go to it can take up to 15 minutes to fill the tank because the pump will click off every 20 cents It has been doing this since I got it and I ve had it for 2 years  Another reason is that it has had 2 safety recalls I just think that if you are going to put that much money into a new car you should not have to deal with these types of problems  It may be petty but after a while you get agitated while trying to put gas in your car when it is really cold outside There are good points to the car for example it drives pretty good and it is comfortable Overall though I wish I would have gotten a different car br br  
Neg, My husband was transferred from Indiana to Georgia and decided my poor little Tracer just wouldn t make it on the racetracks they call highways in Georgia  He had one free day to go to the dealership and trade it for something  quot bigger  better  faster quot  He came home with a new Contour  I have been driving this car for over two years now and I love the fact that it keeps up with the 90 mph traffic on the highways  It does have a little more interior space than my Tracer  But I have had no less than 7 recalls on this car over the last 2 years  Some of them were for minor problems  but some of them were serious enough to have killed me or someone else  I also had a problem that wasn t even on the recall list  I would probably be much less upset about this had we not paid so much for this car  We paid over  16 000 for this car and the only options we got were air conditioning  not really an option in Georgia  and a rear spoiler  No power anything  no tape or cd player  etc  I MISS MY TRACER br br  
Neg, When I rented a Contour  I was very pleased with the performance  handling and economy of the car  In fact  I liked it so much that I bought one  Now I wish I had bought a Buick In the year and a half I have owned the car  there have been at least four recall notices and several service advisories issued  I have replaced one wheel bearing  at 43 000 miles  and my mechanic told me it was never properly packed with grease   I had over 175 000 miles on my previous car before I had to replace any wheel bearings  I now need to replace another bearing  the air conditioning does not work  there is a leak in a right front body seal that allows water to drip on the floor if the car is parked on an incline during a rainstorm  the left passenger door hinge groans and squeaks  the seal around the left passenger door allows road water in the door  and the carpet does not fit  I have replaced one front speaker and now need another one  I have also replaced the climate control switch  but it still malfunctions during very damp weather  when I need the defrosters most Complaints to Ford Motor Customer Service and the Better Business Bureau have resulted in  quot Well  your warranty expired  so too bad quot This experience has not only put me off ever buying another Contour  but possibly another Ford product br br  
Neg, After more than two years of mechanical problems  we finally sold my wife s 1998 Contour XL the other day  Yes it gets you from point A to point B  but that s about it  Her car was in the shop numerous times for all sorts of problems  I wrote Ford Motor Company to ask them about the quality of their vehicles and received a form letter in response thanking me for my feedback and telling me that Ford values its customers  What a joke  Ford can t build a car that comes close to standing up to Honda  Toyota  Nissan  etc  and they know it  If you don t believe me  check the J D  Powers list of autos with fewest mechanical problems  No Fords on it  Ever wonder why  If you want to spend your money on a car with less than average dependability and fit and finish  then the Contour is for you  It rattles  shakes  and won t always run very good  But the good news is you get to visit the Ford Service Department often and enjoy coffee with other Ford owners     
Neg, My wife and I purchased this vehicle when she was promoted to a manager at the restaurant in which she worked  We needed a second vehicle for her to get to work  This was not a leisure purchase  We decided to buy it at a dealer for which my mother works  Kenny Ross Ford in Irwin  Unfortunately  the problems began at the dealership  Even though I was immediate family to an employee  they tried to sell me the vehicle for almost  4500 over the invoice price  Luckily  I am an avid online shopper and visited the kelly blue book site before I went to examine the vehicle  or I may have assumed that I was getting a nice deal  This vehicle was purchased because it was the closest vehicle that Ford had to a Toyota Corolla  we had a 1992 Toyota Corolla that we finally traded in 1999 after having driven it for almost 200 000 miles  Compared to what we were used to  we like the vehicle for the lighting features  like interior lights that activate when the door knobs are pulled from the outside  This is convenient in the dark when you are trying to get in and start the car  Most everything else about the car is horrible  For the size  it doesn t get very good gas mileage  nothing compared to the Corolla that we had  It handles rough  I don t drive it frequently  but when I do  it is my wife s vehicle  I seem to have to work harder at controlling it  There always seems to be problems with this vehicle  I believe it has been recalled for at least 6 items  I lost count after that  some of the recalls aren t minor  There is still a problem with the vehicle over heating  They can t seem to find anything wrong  but I have spent plenty on fixing things that aren t wrong  I personally don t feel that anyone should buy this vehicle  This one purchase of a Ford has convinced me that I will always buy Toyotas  This Ford Contour has about 60 000 miles on it at this point and we are hoping to be rid of it by May 2001  We just can t waste any more time with it in service  Compared to the Toyota that we own  the Ford is driven less  but serviced more at a higher cost  I m sorry  but if that is the best that Ford can do  than no matter whether my mother works for them or not  I d rather have the reliability of a Toyota     
Neg, I purchased a 1998 Contour in July of 1998  I d had experience with the Contour due to renting Contours several times in the U S  and Europe  Its handling and MPG were acceptable to me so when it was time to bit the bullet  I paid  14K new with only a few frills  Overall  the car has been wonderful its Ford that is working my last nerve  In the first year alone  I had to take the car back to the Ford dealership that it was purchased from 5 times for recall repairs  What a hassle  That being said  I never noticed anything wrong with the car It is great for a small family  it fits a car seat and two people in the back seat  The roof of the car seems to be slightly higher than the Taurus  so my 6 foot 2 husband could sit in the car rather easily  It seems to me that Ford  while trying to introduce a car between the soon to be gone Escort and the Taurus  has not really thought through the building of the Contour in America  My car was built at the Kansas City Ford plant and in spite of their kindly calls to see how I liked the car  they still built a car that had  5 RECALLS  UPDATE  It s been almost two years since I wrote that review  There have been more recalls  But at least recall repairs are free  The major problems have been coming out of my pocket  Two months ago  I had to replace the tie rod ends and tires  400  and now the transmission has failed and needs to be replaced due to a bad clutch plate  Ford dealership mechanics have refused to accept responsibility for this problem by saying  It s not our job to fix Ford s mistakes  and  It s a lemon  you should get rid of it  Ford Corporate says  Sorry  we make a bad car every once in awhile  luck of the draw  and that I should save my  2500 transmission bill as there will probably be another recall on it  Other Contour reviews also describe major transmission problems  Buy a Kia   Ford doesn t stand by their work  
Neg, I don t own a Ford Contour  but I rented one for my class reunion in GA last weekend  I had the car for only 4 days  but I noticed immediately many of the ups and downs of this automobile I currently own 2 cars that have amazing stereo systems in them  One has an incredible 7 speaker Nakamichi stereo  see my Lexus LS400 review also  The Ford Contour had a very basic 4 speakers system that took some getting use to  The most obvious problem was the deck wattage output  With the volume all the way up  sound quality was poor and distortion from any amount of bass was unacceptable  I ve heard some of the Mach systems in other Fords  so I know quality is in reach if a potential buyer needs something better In Georgia it is humid almost year round  so a top notch ventilation system is a must  The Contour has that down pat  The AC worked very well with simple knobs and switches for easy operation and it blew VERY COLD just how I like it  Acceleration was a disappointment also  Flooring the gas pedal resulted in a lot more noise than movement  which was quite a let down for a modern day V6  Handling was a pleasant surprise  especially cornering  Taking a quick turn wasn t at all a frightening experience like in some cars this size  but the rattles from the interior made me wonder if something might fall off the next time The classification of this car has a lot of competition  The Nissan Altima  Toyota Corolla  Mitsubishi Galant  and Saturn make it a crowded field in the similar price range  I ve driven the all new Nissan Sentra and I think it s a hidden treasure in itself The Ford Contour is an acceptable vehicle for the die hard Ford fan that will never consider another brand  but the competition is stiff and many better cars are out there for the taking at a comparable price br br  
Neg, I bought my 98 Ford Contour in December of 1999 because I was looking for a reliable car  Since that time  I have had to take it in for 4 recalls  air conditioning stopped working and needed new coil and unit  fumes coming into car  they haven t been able to identify the cause as of yet  and they don t know yet why the car is beginning to be difficult to start  All of these problems require drop off at a dealership  waiting for a ride to work  or making other arrangements  or getting a rental car due to the work not being completed by end of day   which translates into missed time from the job  I have a strong feeling that this is only the beginning of the constant repairs I am going to have with this car I like the design  leg room space  and comfortable ride of the Ford Contour  I dislike car repairs and unreliability I will not buy another Ford again  nor would I recommend a Ford to a friend br br  
Neg, I bought this vehicle because I read an article in  quot Consumer Reports quot  stating that this was a top quality vehicle and I liked the way it looked and handled at first  However  my respect for  quot Consumer Reports quot  went down rapidly  This vehicle is nice to drive when you aren t carrying a load of any kind and when the sun is shining  The Ford Ranger is a nice looking truck with comfortable seats and is good for those Sunday drives  However  the Ford Ranger is also a truck with very little power for hauling trailers or carrying any loads  such as for moving a desk for the office or a chair for the living room  The Ford Ranger is also a truck that is very expensive to fix and requires alot of repairs that need to be done at the dealership  where costs are much higher  For example  I took my vehicle into my mechanic to get a diagnostic done and the diagnostic came up with nothing wrong  so I went and got a second opinion and still nothing was wrong  but my engine light was still on and I needed to know what was going on  Finally I had to take my truck into the dealership and get a diagnostic  which cost  159 95   tax  They found the problem and told me that Ford trucks need to have diagnostics run on Ford equipment to get an accurate reading  There is nothing about this in the owner s manual  This vehicle is also very poor in inclimate weather  In rainy  icy and snowy conditions  this vehicle is like driving a bumper car on the road  Any poor road conditions and this vehicle turns like a whale and slides like it is on a  quot Slip and Slide quot  child s toy  Basically  this is a very poor excuse for a pick up truck  This vehicle should only be bought by people in warm weather climates  who just need a nice looking cruise around pick up truck  and who can afford to make repairs two or three times annually  Anyone not meeting this description should stay away from this pick up truck br br  
Neg, The Ford Ranger is a decent pickup truck for light loads  I bought this truck for moving stuff like a lawn mower and stuff like that  I loved this truck because it drove really smoothly and it looked pretty sharp  I hated this truck because it has no balls  I mean come on a truck is suppose to be manly  The only way i can feel like a man is if i can wax someone at a stop light  good luck doin it with this truck  The sound system in this truck is terrible  The speakers are for old people who dont like to crank it  Another reason why it is not a good truck is because of the sad engine that they but in these  Come on a V6 in a new truck is not needed anywhere  If you want a truck that can do something other then pull a small trailer with a small load i wouldnt recommend this truck at all br br  
Neg, I was on vacation in Florida in 2003 and during that time I had the opportunity to rent the 2002 Ford Mustang Convertible  I drove it for more than a week  so I think that I was able to see the good and the bad sides of driving this particular car Engine and transmission The Mustang that I drove had 3 8 liter V 6 in it mated to a 4 speed automatic transmission  The engine was adequately powerful and didn 146t need to downshift a single time  no matter what the road was  It was a silky smooth engine too  with deep  low  satisfying engine note  as a matter of fact I mistaken it for V 8 at first  but then out of curiosity I opened the hood  and saw that it was a V 6  The engine sounded just like V 8  The transmission that the engine is mated to is very smooth also  with barely noticeable shifts  Even the kickdown was smooth  And that 146s where good stuff ends Handling The car handled like a van  Slightest turn and the car was rocking and rolling all over the place  While the car has very good ride in the straight line  doing a very good job isolating driver from the road bumps  if you need to make a turn  and I am talking about just a slight turn  not something extreme  you better have your seatbelt fastened  or you have a good chance of landing somewhere outside of the car  Granted it is a convertible  so it is not as stiff as a coupe  but still  it is considered a sports car afterall  so it should at least drive like one Design and Ergonomics The car looks good from the outside  It has nice curves but without boy racer look  so it appeals to both older and younger drivers  The visibility from the driver 146s seat is very good  The front seats are cramped for such a large car  It is as long as many sedans  and wider than most of them  but it is pretty cramped in the front  and I am not even mentioning the backseat which is suitable mostly for children  I am 6 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds  which is pretty average  Whoever was in charge of ergonomics should 146ve been fired or limited to designing floormats for Yugos  The door release lever is below driver 146s knee  in the most awkward spot  right where you would never expect to find it  It took me a while to find it the first time when I was trying to get out of the car at night  None of the window switches are lit at night  same goes to power locks  There is no trunk release lever inside the car  so you need to get out of the car  and either use the key or button on remote control  On the fifth day of driving the car  I finally found the controls for moving the driver seat  they were located in the front of the seat  power seat in this case  and not on the left or right edge of the front side of the seat  but right behind driver 146s legs  When you try to open or close the top  you have to use the two levers  one on each side of the windshield  which might be troublesome for a single person  In Ford Thunderbird  they finally replaced them with single central lever  which is foolproof and easy to use  The heating cooling controls were designed in the dumbest way possible  For example  if you use air conditioning  you can not direct the airflow to the desired spot  because there is no separate button for A C  Rather there is separate position for A C on the same knob that is used to direct the airflow  so if the knob is in A C position  it cannot be in defog position  I could not use the A C for longer than 40 minutes  since I was wearing flip flops  Florida  and was risking of freezing my toes off To be fair  Ford took care of most of these stupidities in their Ford Thunderbird convertible  but it also costs twice as much as the Mustang I drove In the end  I would not recommend this car to anybody  as after short period of time  the feeling of rip off will set in  as you start thinking about how much money Ford saved by giving the Mustang interior design job to a group of 5 Detroit bums  
Neg, I don t own this car  but I have driven and ridden in it as a passenger  This review will share some of my experiences in the car First thing  the car makes bumps feel like craters in the ground  You will feel every little pothole in the road will tooth jarring clarity  SOmetimes when driving the car when I hit a bump  my arm smacks the armrest  made out of hard plastic  and my arm feels like it fractures  This does not say a lot for the struts shocks or the armrest Next item  the car sits straight up and down  I thought that I would be lying down and driving with an arm extended  but this is not the case  I sit very up and down  just like driving a regular non sports sedan  One nice thing is that the driver s seat has a lumbar support that blows up to the size of the Goodyear Blimp  If you have a crampy lower back  this is nice  However  there is no passenger lumbar support The car has good leg room  as I am 6 2  and do not feel cramped  especially in the passenger seat  The headroom is OK  but the car is cut in such a way that I have to be VERY careful when getting in and out not to smack my head  Once I had to bend over so much to get into the driver s side that I pulled a muscle in my chest and was in pain for the whole next day The car has an annoying feature of the window opening all the way when just pushed down a little on the driver s side  Since I like to crack the window even in the winter  I hit the down button just a touch  but the whole window opens  However  I am told this is standard on new cars  as is the lack of a cigarette lighter  so I suppose I ll just have to deal with it The car has standard airbags  but no head airbags or side airbags  so just make sure that if you plan on crashing  you get into a head on collision  not a side impact On the plus side  the car has a nice sound system and it looks cool to drive around in  The color is nice too  And the thing really moves  The V8 in the GT has a lot of power and great pickup for highway merges  
Neg, Driving the Mustang with its hard seats  lack of lumbar support and a hard as a rock suspension is like riding a real mustang and you will get saddle sores I looked over the field before I bought the Mustang and it had the power edge  All I was interested in at the time was power and edgy looks  I also just had to have a convertible  However  all that changed when I realized that I spend very little time looking at the car and a lot of time being beaten to death by it on the road  It feels like it will break apart over some of the bumps  It is also very loud inside the car  I can barely hear the stereo at cruise  There is a lot of rear end whine  It sounds like a big rig is passing me but there is no truck there It wasn t long before I was wishing I had bought the Celica  I shouldn t have gone and looked at the Celica once I bought the Mustang because I could kick myself  The Celica is much more quality oriented  the ride is smoother and the image suggests that I am not a redneck idiot  Mustang suggests a redneck with grease under the nails and an inferiority complex  
Neg, I bought a 1994 Ford Mustang because of the looks and when I test drove it I enjoyed the ride  I had always wanted a Mustang since before I got my license and I had just that for my first car  The car looks very sporty and has plenty of curves  It comes with either a V6 or V8 engine and hard top or convertible  The seats were very comfortable with the exception of there not being much room in the car  If you want a roomy backseat though  this car isn t for you  It can feel a little bit cramped though  The controls on the car are easy to reach and not difficult to figure out  And being short  the power seats were very much appreciated  It comes with basically power everything  seats  windows  door locks  It also comes with tilt steering and airbags  and four disk brakes  ABS at that time was an option for the car I believe which I didn t have  It even has one cup holder which is convenient to reach exciting isn t it  I recommend the Mustang having a spoiler because without one it doesn t look right to me  I bought the car without a spoiler and ended up buying one down the road  I loved how the car handled corners and the acceleration was decent for a V6  With good tires and a dry road  it holds the road very well and hugs corners nicely  I thought the interior was very well done and it was a big improvement from past year Mustangs which looked cheap and lacked taste  I prefer the more recent Ford interiors over most other car manufacturers because they seem more appealing and are better made  The car was horrible in the winter  well  if you consider going up a hill sideways in the snow bad  Of course  any sports car in the winter is a challenge to drive  When you drive this car you can feel every bump in the road and it gets to be uncomfortable after a while  Things tend to shake and rattle in the car at times  because of bumpy roads  but for the most part this car is best suited for an even  well paved road because then the road is smooth and relatively quiet  The gas mileage for the highway is very good  It gets about 27 miles to the gallon on the highway  Local driving it gets about 17 to 20 depending on the stop and go of driving  With the gas tank only being 15 4 gallons going to the gas station at times happens frequently but when you drive all over the place it is expected  The one thing against Ford and their sports cars compared to Chevy is that the older Mustangs are a little bit underpowered considering what the Camaro has even though with the newer model Mustangs they increased the horsepower  To my best knowledge  the 1994 3 8 L V6 Mustang has about 145 horsepower with 230 pounds of torque which to me isn t bad but compared to about 50 more horsepower with the Camaro Chevy puts Ford to shame   if you want to see a comparison of the two I believe Vara has a review on these two cars I do not reccomend this car to anyone who doesn t have the money for repairs or who doesn t want to sink a lot into the car  Why you ask I ll tell you  First of all  my transmission went at 40 000 miles and that was about twelve hundred to fix  I had another friend who had a 1994 Mustang GT and her transmission went at about 34 000 miles  Ford wouldnt even honor any part of the warranty and my family had been buying cars from that dealer for years  Secondly  I had to spend another four hundred dollars to get the frame fixed in the back because somehow it had cracked and i have never been in an accident  The car sucks up gas like theres no tomorrow in the winter  it handles poorly in any type of bad weather condition and it seemed like any time i turned around something was going wrong with the car or something was breaking  Then again  maybe I just had a poorly manufactured Mustang  My car has a very loud and obnoxious engine knock that wont go away except when I put high octane gas it in  When that is done  the engine purrs like a kitten and I love the way the engine sounds when I hit the accelerator hard  I have had a few problems keeping the wheels aligned and it has wore down a lot of my tires but considering I tend to drive it hard at times I most likely am to blame the most for wear and tear and the tires  If you have the money it can be worth getting but unless Ford made better quality cars  it d be sufficient to say you might be throwing money down the toilet for this car  If you want looks  the Mustang is nice  but if you want reliability stay far away from this car  In my opinion  and I m not a mechanic so I can t say for sure  pounding this car while accelerating does more damage to the transmission than anything else  From what I have heard Ford s transmissions are very weak and that is why the Cobra Mustang only has a manual transmission because the automatic isn t strong enough  And to top that off I have been told Ford makes a cr ppy transmission for the six cylinder cars anyway and its one of their worst transmissions  Again  I don t know how true this actually is so I am not saying for sure I am right  Either way  I do not recommend abusing the transmission and that goes for any car  For the most part  take it easy with the car  Don t floor it from a dead stop unless necessary  Once in a while is okay I m assuming but not constant  Again  this car is a pleasure to drive on a nice day cruising the roads and even though I partially hate this car because of all the trouble it has had  its 80 000 miles strong and each time I have to go somewhere I still look forward to getting behind the wheel  At one point I loved this car so much I gave it a pet name  My car s name is Billy  Everyone say hi to my baby  Billy  And when Billy goes one day it will be missed I ll almost feel like I ve lost a child   I m not crazy really  just a little too attached     
Neg, About a year ago I bought a Mustang GT to fulfill a dream  As many others  I always loved the mustang  Finally I was able to buy one  I was very lucky because I found one that was only driven on the weekends  The previous owner took really good care of it  Everyone thought I had bought a brand new car  I wanted to buy a stick shift vehicle but This vehicle was in such good shape that I opted to buy it even though it was an automatic  A decision I have lived to regret  More on that later  Driving this vehicle is awesome  Lots of power even for an automatic  The seats are comfortable and the layout of the inside is shaped somewhat like a mini cockpit  It handles great in dry weather and handles better than expected on rain  DO NOT DRIVE ON SNOW  Take the bus  I love the rumble sound that comes out of the dual exhaust  I love the looks you get when you drive it  I love how you can blow away most of these little Honda cars that have all kinds of work done to the engines and they still sound like lawn mowers  Don t get me wrong I love Honda cars I think they are the most reliable but not most powerful  Yes the mustang is a great muscle car  But that is it Now for the negatives  For starters the gas mileage is unreal  18 Miles to the gallon if you drive like a retired old person  If you drive like a 16 year old you are looking at about 10 miles to the gallon  The automatic transmission died and had to be rebuild for a whopping  2000  The Idle sometimes is too low and the car shuts off at stop lights  This is only a rare occurrence  The windshield wiper relay function works only on occasion  The ride is super rough  I live in NY and the potholes here are unreal  And in a Mustang they feel like the grand canyon  There is virtually no head room and no back seat room  The windshield is small and you will find yourself looking around the rearview mirror  The tires are expensive and don t last too long  so many little things I could go on forever  I do not comprehend why Ford continues to build vehicles so unreliable and with so many defects  One would think they would have improved the quality by now and maybe have some pride in building their cars  The bottom line is this is not a car but a toy which has to be taken care of greatly and can only be abused on occasion  I would recommend having a small reliable Japanese car that saves lots of gas so you can have that for everyday use and drive the mustang only on the weekends  It will last longer and save you money in the long run  I personally will never buy a ford vehicle after this experience  Even though I kind of love the Mustang and don t really what to give it up  I am looking into buying some little Honda for everyday use     
Neg, The Ford Mustang was redesigned for 1994  although it was still based on a modified Fox chassis  called Fox 2  that dated back to 1979  Hatchbacks were discontinued  but coupes and convertibles remained  Compared to the previous generation  the  94 Mustang was longer  wider  and lower  The weak four cylinder engine was also discontinued  A 145 horsepower V6 engine was standard  while the GT used a 215 horsepower V8  A Borg Warner T5 5 speed manual transmission was standard  an electronically controlled 4 speed automatic optional  Although all Mustangs for 1994 had 4 wheel disc brakes  anti lock brakes were optional  Convertibles included a power top and glass rear window  with an optional rear defogger  Mustang Cobras came with a powerful 5 0 liter 240 horsepower V8  and were sold in limited numbers  With a stiffer suspension than ordinary Mustangs  Cobras came only with a 5 speed manual and had standard ABS as well as a slightly different styling b EXTERIOR   The Mustang s pony car styling was redesigned for 1994 with a sexy  more rounded body  This years body styling is a far cry from the boxy angular Mustang that debuted in 1979  The front hood vents look nice  but serve no purpose  The Cobra s 5 spoke 17 inch alloy wheels look great  The standard GT wheels look okay  but I prefer the Cobra s b INTERIOR   My test GT made a LOT of noise  If wind noise is not intruding at speeds above 65 mph  then the rather loud exhaust engine noise is  The interior looks very old school with cheap looking hard plastic everywhere  The controls are easy to use and reach  Build quality is sub par  The front seats are comfortable enough for long drives  but for tall people like myself  there is just not enough leg room to stretch out and be REALLY comfortable  I like the GT s power lumbar support feature  optional  It makes the seats even more hospitable  The long  heavy doors are a nuisance in tight spaces and when parked sideways on hills The rear seats are very small  There is absolutely no leg room for the long legged and even people about 5 feet 5 inches will feel confined  The mere act of entering the backseat requires a gymnastic that most people will find a hassle  Just to get in  you have to duck under the low roofline  or risk bumping your head  squeeze between the seat and the doorjamb  and be prepared to have your knees digging into the driver s or front passenger s seat  if you are tall  Trunk space is insufficient for everyday living  If you plan on keeping a Mustang as your weekend sports car  then there is enough room to carry a few golf bags and other stuff b ENGINE   The standard engine is a 3 8 liter OHV pushrod V6 engine that produces 145 horsepower at 4 000 rpm  and 215 lb ft  of torque at 2 750 rpm  It is available with either a 5 speed manual or a 4 speed automatic  The V6 when paired with either transmission is adequate enough for most situations  but I did notice that when paired with the automatic  it was a little reluctant to downshift  The GT comes with a more powerful 5 0 liter OHV pushrod V8 engine  It makes 215 horsepower at 4 200 rpm and 285 lb ft  of torque at 3 300 rpm  With either transmission  the torque comes on very quickly  but has the tendency to run out of breath after about 5 000 rpm  Other than that  there is more than enough passing power and a LOTS of low end torque  The Cobra uses a modified version of the GT s V8 and produces 240 horsepower at 5 000 rpm  but the same 285 lb ft  of torque at a higher 4 000 rpm  Although the Cobra never feels weak at low rpms  its engine was tuned for more mid range torque and all but eliminates that weak top end feeling that ruins the GT model s fun  I averaged 15 7 mpg on the recommended premium fuel  but Ford says mid grade 89 octane fuel is reasonable b HANDLING   There is more than enough lateral grip in the corners  and overall is very fun to fling around corners  There is more body lean than expected in ALL models but nosedive is serious only on the base and GT models  I feel the steering wheel could be stiffer than it is on the base and GT models  but the Cobra s is nicely weighted for sporty driving  Unfortunately  all Mustangs of this model year have the tendency to have their tail ends  skip  around bumpy corners  All Mustangs have a problem when it comes to handling in wet weather  All models spin the tires when trying to come up a hill after a stop if you are not very careful with the throttle  Snow practically immobilizes the Mustang b RIDE   With a longer wheelbase and a few extra hundred pounds than the  93 model  the ride is still stiff  but not as jarring as before  The GT s suspension is poorly damped  and feels like it is crashing over large bumps  Even on apparently flat  smooth roads  you can still feel the GT jumping on occasions  picking up even the smallest road imperfection  Although the Cobra model has a stiffer suspension  it rides very much the same as the GT b RELIABILITY   Unfortunately  my test GT was plagued with problems  The owner received 4  no  that is NOT a typo  recalls during his entire ownership of the car  For more info about these recalls visit this website http www nhtsa dot gov cars problems Not to mention the trouble spots  There is a chattering noise that can be felt coming from the rear during tight turns after highway driving  I read that this is caused by a defect in the clutch packs in the Traction Lok  PosiTrac  differential  My test GT came with the automatic transmission  When I put it in OverDrive  it had the tendency to slip  and then the engine would flare to rather high rpms depending on how hard the gas pedal is pressed  According to the owner  when the Mustang had about 70 000 miles on it  the transmission did the same thing  He said that he had replaced it with a rebuilt automatic transmission that had 50 000 miles on it and within 5 000 miles  started acting up again  Make sure that if you decide to buy a Mustang GT with an automatic transmission  have a dealer check it for any problems b VALUE   All Mustangs deliver good performance at a reasonable price and should be an attractive buy for anyone at any age  The V6 model is more of a daily driver than the Cobra or GT  but is not as quick  If you shop for a V8 model  it would be wise to have another car in your garage for when the weather gets wet or you need the cargo room to haul  
Neg, I always wanted  quot The Mustang quot  And a convertible to boot  I bought this car after a divorce and I wanted something with some muscle and I wanted to go topless  These turned out to be the best parts of this machine  I liked the power it had although it needed more  and it gets a lot of looks on the freeway from the opposite sex  maybe because it was red  or topless Who cares  It is fun to drive most of the time  I have not been totally pleased with the performance of this car  The first year it seemed to have a lot more power than it does 4 years later  I understand that an engine will lose some power  but I feel a significant loss in mine  It has been serviced well by the way  so I don t feel that it is the problem  It has also been in the shop a lot for some steering problems and items that should have lasted longer than they did  I like the tightness of the car and the steering  It reminds me of the 79 Trans Am if anyone has ever driven one  This car left me longing for much more power though  and I think I would shop around more the next time I want a sports car  If you want looks and a fun car to drive  you probably can t go wrong but of you want speed and performance  then look again  Also  I do not recommend an automatic in this car  You lose a lot of power and performance as well as my transmission is going out at only 100 000 miles maybe that s why I call her  quot Christine quot     
Neg, I bought a 1994 Mustang LX coupe for a decent price  but quickly learned it was not quite a solid vehicle  After having owned 3 Mustang convertibles in the past  I was confident that the new body style wouldn t have been a compromise in quality  but from the day I brought it home  it had problems  I was told that I would have to replace the transmission to fix the shutter  but a full servicing fixed that problem for the most part  it still didn t shift quite right  but the shutter disappeared  I d had transmission problems with my  93  so I was happy that it only cost  200 to get it fixed this time   but within 3 months  I was sorry I ever purchased the car  At 136k miles  the head gasket blew  When I called the dealership to get a quote on repairs  I was told there had been a recall on this car  so I took it down there after the engine had cooled back down  Turns out  Ford won t back their cars after 100k  and I was going to be stuck with  1200    1500 bill to fix it  I traded it in  got less than 1 3 of what i paid for it  and got a 1996 Thunderbird  and it s a very solid car  My strong recommendation  if you are interested in a 1994 Mustang  is to check its history  Find out if it was recalled for the head gasket before purchasing it  because mine went FAST  Also  I was plagued with permanently squealy brakes that noone could figure out  so make sure it has a good radio to drown out that annoying noise  
Neg, UPDATE  I am writing this update after owning my 2001 Ford Focus wagon only 4 1 2 months  After taking my vehicle to the auto dealership to have them investigate why when the windows go down  especially the rear ones  an extremely loud and painful vibration occurs  When the service tech was in the car for a drive to understand the problems noted to him my husband rolled down the windows  The tech described the sound and discomfort to when his ear drum broke a few months back  As you can see the noise is painful  The tech then called the engineering department at Ford to find out how to deal with the problem  The engineer had no idea as to how to fix the problem and said he had a stack of similar complaints on his desk  Ford is selling Focus wagons knowing there is a window problem  I am now in the process of finding out how to handle this problem  How discouraging to buy a brand new car and be making payments and can t even roll down my windows  Beware when checking into purchasing this vehicle We are spending too much on gas for that van  I told my husband  With that comment I went on my search for a new vehicle I knew I needed and wanted something big enough to still haul stuff like lumber or my kids bikes  A regular car trunk just isn t deep enough for transporting lumber or long items  So  I knew if I wasn t getting another gas eating van it would have to be some sort of station wagon  Now  narrowed down to body type I went on my search of different makes and models of station wagons  My first priority was price  Being a family of 5 money is tight and I needed something affordable  but of good quality  I checked the prices of the VW Jetta wagon and the Saturn wagon  Both were quite a bit more expensive  The Ford Focus was by far the more affordable of the three  Having access to a Ford A plan was another deciding factor  Ford also at the time of my purchase was offering rebates and interests rates of 500 00 cash back 6 9  interest or 1000 00 cash back and 7 99  interest We all know you get what you pay for  and maybe thinking it is cheaper because it is lacking in features  This is far from the truth  The Focus Wagon has standard features such as  power door locks  power windows  CD player  air conditioning and cruise control  Unfortunately  ABS breaks are not a standard feature and cost around 350 400 to have the option included The ease of getting in and out of the car was another factor in my purchase  Unlike a lot of small cars the Focus Wagon seats sit higher  I really like the crank under the seat to adjust the seating height  I hate sitting in a car where my head almost touches the roof  That is not a problem in the Focus Wagon  The storage space in the back is extremely roomy and the pull over cover is an added plus  I went shopping for 2 weeks of groceries for a family of 5 and had no problems getting all the bags in comfortably  Space is definitely not a problem The gas mileage is the most important feature of this vehicle  With today s gas prices going up this is a must feature to be looking at when choosing a new car  The engine in mine is a Zetec 4 25 L  It still has pep  but doesn t need a lot of gas to achieve the goal  My first fill up  after driving about 110 highway miles and then some city driving also  I figured the Focus Wagon got around 27 mile to the gallon If you are looking for something affordable  roomy and has great gas mileage the Ford Focus Wagon is worth the money  
Neg, If you re looking for a commuter car  you ve found it  I own a 2door 94  Aspire with no options  This car is basically a lawnmower engine surrounded by sheet metal  My friends call it the Ford Expire because if you crash in it you re bound to die  I m sure that s totally exaggerated  Actually it has driver and passenger side airbags  That s about as sophisticated as the car gets  Traction is ridiculous  Those little BMX wanna be bike tires have hardly any surface area to touch the road  Therefore breaking distance is pretty bad  If you live in a cold climate forget about it  This car doesn t like snow at all  As for ice  It s like sliding an egg across a frozen lake  Power steering isn t needed  the care weighs close to nothing  A large group of friends can lift all four off the ground  I don t recommend it though  The interior is drab and cramped  Seats are uncomfortably stiff  The manual transmission won t agree with your passengers  The stick shift hits their knees in 5th gear  The back seat is enormous considering the size of the car  The back seats two adults quite comfortably for a small car  The instruments are easy to see even though they are few in number  The doors are an ugly plastic as is the rest of the interior  No carpeted doors or nice dash for this puppy  Now that I m done trashing the interior and tiny little tires  lets talk about performance  If you re really lucky  you might squeeze 60ponies out of that 4cylinder  You can floor it in just about any gear and not even feel the acceleration  Try passing someone on a highway and you re in for a shock  When you drop down to 4th gear and floor it  the only thing that happens is the engine hits a high pitched whine  and the car doesn t go any faster  Basically this car has no power  If that worries you  test drive it  You can t possibly image the lack of power in an auto until you try this one  Nothing I can say will prepare you for the feeling of helplessness you encounter on an onramp in heavy traffic  You ll be struggling to hit 50mph with cars whizzing past you at 65  Just close your eyes  cut into traffic  and pray someone slows down  It s not all bad though  This car does have one advantage  Maintenance  The engine is as reliable as they come  It can take quite a beating and keeps putting out that unheard of mileage  I average 50mpg on the highway and 40mpg in the city  Yup  that s 50mpg  With gas prices rising  that s an invaluable asset  On long highway drives I have even managed to get 55mpg  This comes at a cost though  Not only does the engine have no power as is  but in order to get these wonderful mileages  you have to sacrifice even more power and shift with the yellow light  The light is on the dash and tells you when to shift up  First gear is wound up so tight it ll blow the engine at a little over 5mph and kill your mileage on the way there  2nd can go to about 20mph or 25mph  but for gas you shift out of 2nd at about 10 or 15mph  3rd can go to about 40mph  but for gas it s 20mph  4th can go to about 60  at this speed the engine emits a high pitched whine  but for gas it s 35mph  5th gear has no power whatsoever  Notice a patern  You re in 5th gear by the time you re rolling  It takes forever to get to 55mph  and in the meantime you re only in the other gears for a few seconds  Nothing else on the car requires much maintenance  It s a noisy  unrefined egg with wheels  but it ll get you where your going  If you have a kid and are worried about him her speeding  this is their car  Believe me  The first time they try racing a friend  they ll be the laughing stock of their school  I ve been passed by a four wheeler before  The ride is bad  as is control  You ll be getting those little wheels balanced pretty often  Overall  it depends what you re looking for  If you re looking for a car  you don t want this  If you just want a means of transportation at a cheap price  this is your egg     
Neg, Okay I wrote a review a couple of months ago that I have since deleted saying that the Ford Windstar was a great buy  Unfortunately  I have had a change of heart and would not recommend it to anyone not even my worst enemy Okay at least not the 1995 version or any version with the 3 8L V6 engine  I have had a nightmare within two months time coupled with  4 000 00 repair bill  First of all the head gasket blew and I had to have that repaired to the tune of  1 600 00  About one month later my van decided that it would no longer go into reverse  Not a big deal unless you want to BACK UP  So back to the repair shop it goes this time needing a brand new transmission to the tune of  2 600 00  I have yet to get this fixed because I simply cannot afford it  So I hit the net and find out that Ford has known for a long time that this particular year Windstar has had constant trouble in this area  They did offer to refund  900 00 of the head gasket repairs but will not replace or help with the transmission which they are very aware is bad  Their response was  quot Well it is not on recall yet  When it is they will refund your money quot  Hello am I the only one who sees something wrong with this picture  Well I thought I was until I went to the consumer report page and heard some horror stories about the same vehicle  If you are looking for a used car  Go to carfax and run the VIN number and find out it s history  It is  14 00 that I wished I had done  Now I am stuck with a car loan owing more than the trade in value and a repair bill that this one income single family cannot afford  Do not dump your money into this lemon  I hope others with other years never have the same problems  So far they have not had problems with the other years Sometimes you cannot take lemons and make lemonade br br  
Neg, i bought my 1995 Ford Windstar GL brand new in 1995  i must have been drunk it was  18 000 with tax  and came with the 3 8L MPFI V 6 i have been the only owner of this Windstar and i Always take good care of all my vehicles  personally changing the oil religiously every 3000 miles  keeping them washed  engines always clean enough to eat off of  armor all the tires every week  etc  i am a car freak and enjoy taking care of my stable but within 3 years  this Ford Windstar received no less than 7 Factory Recalls some of the major ones are  Defective Head Gasket  but they wouldn t fix or replace unless there was Visible damage already  ie  white smoke  overheating  etc  the Ford dealership told me Not to bring it in for the  quot Recall Fix quot  unless it was already Broken  GRRR  Hood Separation at High Speed  the recall notice said at high speeds   the flimsy plastic hood may Separate  so they applied more glue to my hood  Side Door Reinforcement  the sliding side door needed to have a beam welded inside it  the Stupid Fat mechanic that was working on my car Cracked one of my inside door panels while performing this recall  when i informed the dealership of the damage  at first they Denied it  they said I broke it myself  after complaining to the service manager AND the dealership manager  they finally agreed to replacing the interior body panel the mechanic broke  but the part had to be Special Ordered  which took a week  and another few days for them to Install it  GRRR  Transmission Fluid Pan was Leaking like Crazy  it was leaking ATF fluid faster than i could pour it in  my van had first developed a slow tranny pan leak after about 10K miles  but the Ford dealership told me it was a  quot normal maintanance quot  problem and Not a Defect  so i had to fix it myself  grrrr  Gas Tank Reinforcement  the recall notice said the cheap plastic gas tank may Crack or Leak in high temperature conditions  so a flimsy metal strap was installed to  quot reinforce quot  it Nitpicky Complaints  the Rear Bench Seats are Very Heavy  have a friend help you remove install the rear bench seats or you ll mess up your back  the window cranks  on non electric window  are in a very Awkward location  almost all the way to the floor and toward the front  Don t try to open close your windows while driving  Seatbelts are very uncomfortable  Rearview mirrors are awkward  especially at night  the Air Intake duct sits Very Low  sucking in air at tire level from the front driver side  Don t drive thru even low flood waters or your engine will suck in water right thru the air intake duct  this happened to a friend of mine as he drove thru a small puddle and his 3 8L engine was Mangled Needless to say  i will NEVER buy a Ford EVER again  what a complete Nightmare buy a Toyota or Honda instead  they are Worth the extra money br br  
Neg, I bought this vehicle used in  97 and for the most part was satisfied but leery  The vehicle served us well  but for a couple draw backs The ride was comfortable if a little noisy inside  and seats were excellent  Configuration was OK  and we enjoyed and miss the electronic dash that came as an option  As far as draw backs go  we drove it on vacation to Myrtle Beach from Ontario Canada  and on arrival  fortunately  the head gasket blew  as per the Ford recall  they would only replace blown gaskets not fix on spec  Ford was good  I was in the States as a Canadian  and covered it  including towing  100 In the final days as owner we had numerous problems with the ignition switch and undetermined mis shifts from the transmission  The ignition switch was  replaced  twice and in the end left my wife stranded road side while I was away on business  This was the final straw and we parted ways  myself and the van  not my wife  I was leery of the transmission noises as the van is rated poorly for transmission problems and my fears in this regard contributed to our decision to go Japanese and get a 2000 Sienna  All in all I did not hate the van  but feel much as one does when a trusted friend starts to talk behind your back   betrayed br br  
Neg, I purchased a 1995 Ford Windstar in 1998 with 45 000 miles already on it  From the first day we experienced problems that were minor and later had major problems  Some problems were never fixed and were hard to trace  The car always  intermittent  indicated that one door was ajar  Usually this happened going around corners and over bumps  We took the van back twice for service but the problem was never fixed  We only gave up on fixing this problem after several major problems overshadowed the minor one  The first major problem was the battery went dead  which by itself is not major  however we tried to jump start the car which ended up burning out the on board computer  Battery cost plus tow was 100  The second time the battery went dead was within the next two days  Again a tow was in order and a bill for  300 for the onboard computer  Next the car overheated  and was localized to the water pump  Again not a significant problem by itself but later the van continued to overheat  Cost for the water pump  I don t remember but we eventually replaced the heads on the engine for  900  The overheating apparently caused the  quot service engine quot  light to appear  When diagnosed we discovered that the oxygen sensor was now faulty  Estimated cost to repair about  300  Now the O D  overdrive  light on the van began to blink and the transmission started to slip  I was told directly related to the overheating  A repaired transmission was quoted at between  1200 1500 we didn t even ask how much for the O D blinking light to be fixed The van had 110K miles on it in the end  We performed minor repairs on the Transmission that cost  150 but the transmission still slipped but only when placed in reverse  We eventually got too frustrated with the van failing and using tow trucks and finally traded it in on a Toyota RAV 4  Brand new  I ll tell you about the RAV 4 in another review br br

Neg, I bought this vehicle because of it s 5 star safety rating  as well as cargo room and passanger room  We are a family with 3 small children and needed a reliable vehicle  which was safe  roomy  and reasonably priced  Since we bought it it s spent 50  of the time in the shop  Although many things were covered buy the warranty  several were not  We bought it used in Feburary of 1999  4 weeks after we purchased it the first engine went due to head gasket problems  2 days after we bought it the engine went once again  due to poor installation  2 weeks after that the transmition went  In less than 20 000 miles we ve also replaced the air conditioning  the water pump  the temperature guage  and several gauges and sensors  Which does not include regular maintenance  car rentals due to constant shop time  time lost from work or aggrivation  Just last month the head gasket had to be replaced once again  It has an oil leak  which although has been brought to the attention of 3 different dealers  we have been told there is nothing that they will do to fix it  The transmition is leaking fluid on a quart a week basis  Quite possibly the most annoying fact is that ford is offering a  quot buy back quot  program for the windstars currently  and because they have covered most of the problems   lt although not all  and certainly not car rental gt  we are NOT eligible for these programs  NOt that I would buy another ford  Ford s customer service has been unresponsive to our problems  and dealer s continueally refuse to return calls  Not only would I not recomend this vehicle to anyone  I wouldn t recomend dealing with ford either  Before we bought it we had heard nothing but good opinions  and coincidentally  as they all reached 50 60 ooo miles  they all began having massive problems br br  
Neg, Note All of the bad things I am about to say about the Ford Windstar only affect Windstars with the 3 8 litre engine  This is the engine used in over 90  of Windstars  even the base models  but if you have one with the old underpowered 3 0 litre you should be alright My parents bought a 95 Windstar LX loaded with most options in 97  It had about 50000km on it  We really liked it  It was in perfect shape when we got it and we bought it from a dealership we had bought from before and they were really good to us  The bad part of the story doesn t start until our last year of owning the vehicle We got an extended warranty on the van because our previous vehicle that we traded in on it  a 93 Mercury Sable  had quite a few problems before the warranty ran out and we didn t want to have to pay a lot of money to keep the thing running  The extended warranty went to about 120000km I think  For the whole warranty period we didn t have one problem with the van  It ran perfect  had good power  was comfortable and we really liked it  I can t remember us having any problems with it at that time The bad news happens later on around 145000km we got a recall notice  actually an extended warranty on a defective Ford product  stating that they will cover the cost of repairs to the head gasket on Ford Windstars up to a certain mileage and date  not very far ahead of the current date at that time  We took the van in to our local dealership  not the one we bought the van at  and this was a big mistake  They say they checked it out and the headgasket was fine  About a month later  past the extended warranty date for the headgasket  at 150000km my parents were driving on the freeway and all of a sudden cold air blew through the heater  Then my dad noticed the temperature gauge was almost as high as it could go  He immediately pulled over  When he opened the hood there was antifreeze everywhere  They got it towed back to the local dumbas  dealership  They looked at it and basically said  Sorry  it s not covered anymore  It s gonna run you  1800 2000 to get fixed  Needless to say my dad was kind of ticked off  The next decision we made was a good one  We called the good old dealership we bought it at  who we had been unfaithful to by bring the van to the other dealer in the first place  They told us they would come pick up our van  from the local dealership  and tow it for free out to their dealership  There had been a lot of complaints to Ford and we were waiting to hear there decision on whether or not they would cover the cost  Meanwhile my mom has to drive to work every day  a 45 minute trip  and my dad has to drive to work at a different time in the morning and a different direction  Our only running vehicle at this time was the trusty old 1983 Pontiac Grand Prix  still running at this time  We called the dealership to see if they could do anything about this and the guy we bought the van off called Ford and seemed to really make some noise  Anyways in no time at all he got Ford to pay half the cost and he decided to chip in 1 4 of the cost  This left us to pay only 1 4 of the cost and we were pretty happy about this  A week later we got a letter from Ford saying that they were sorry but there is nothing they could do  This notice meant nothing because our dealership had already got Ford to pay half  If he hadn t done that we would have been stuck with a big repair bill  In the end the dealership replaced the headgasket and while the engine was out they replaced the spark plugs which did need replacing and they also replaced a belt that was worn  Even with all of this the total bill came out to about  1200 which we paid 1 4 of  This was much less than the estimate the a hole at the other dealership gave us The van seemed to be running fine after this and we were planning on keeping it for a while still  However about a month later with about 155000km on the van mom said something weird happened a couple times when she stopped at a redlight  When she stopped at a redlight and then started to go again she stepped on the gas but the engine just revved up like it was in neutral and then clunked into gear with a lurch  We had a trusted transmission mechanic take it for a test drive but it didn t do anything wrong when he was driving it and it didn t most of the time when we were driving it  He said he would have to take the tranny out to find out if anything was actually wrong and that s already getting into big money  We decided to trade it in as soon as possible on a smaller more economical car  We traded it in and it had seemed to be working alright until the day we were driving it in to pick up our new car  the worst possible time  it started going into neutral at stoplights a few times and when my dad pulled into the parking lot of the Dodge dealer  My dad felt terrible and was really upset by ripping off the Dodge dealer but if we hadn t traded it in we would have been broke  Ford puts cheap a  parts in their vehicles that are known to fail and the customer ends up paying for it in the end Our Windstar gave us reliable transportation most of the time we owned it  The only other problem we had was when we were in Florida the starter connections had gotten corroded and the van wouldn t start  We couldn t get it started even with a boost and had it towed to a Ford dealer  They claimed it was a dead battery so they would rip us off when it only needed a new  5 part  Ford dealerships suck  I only know of the one good one that saved us a lot of money on our blown headgasket  Our Windstar was totally reliable up until about 150000km but that s when the whole friggin drivetrain gave out  This is unacceptable especially considering how much it costs to get these parts replaced  It s also almost impossible for most people to work on these vehicles  Our 1983 Pontiac Grand Prix has never once been in a garage the whole 3 5 years we have owned it  We do all the work on it ourselves and have spent about  100 in repairs the whole time we have owned it The other day I just got off a long day of work and was driving in the grand prix with the windows up and the stereo turned up and there was a windstar on my right with a Quebec license plate and he had his left turn signal on  I figured he didn t know where he was going and was trying to get somewhere so I slowed down a bit to let him change lanes in front of me  He didn t change lanes and I soon realized his had his 4 way flasher on not his signal light and he was going about 25km h in a 50km h zone  Don t know why I thought he was turning  but anyways all of a sudden I realized I could hear an extremely loud knocking coming from the Windstar engine  Right away I thought of our old van and all the complaints about the Windstars that I had read  I passed the van and a little ways up the road I stopped in at a car lot to casually look at cars and listen to the racket from the Windstar as it passed by  I waited for it to come over the hill and I could hear it before I saw it  It was the loudest  most unhealthy knocking I ve ever heard from any engine  That engine had to be TOAST  It looked like they were just trying to make it to their destination and give up on the vehicle  If it s knocking that loud you don t keep driving it unless your not worried about fixing it anyways  It sounded like the engine was about to blow up right then literally  It s undescribable  I m a major car nut and obsessed with engines and this was kind of amusing to me to be able to listen to an engine in such bad shape    I thought it was fun but I definately wouldn t tell the owner of the van that  Anyways with the amount of 95 Windstars giving up the ghost out there  you are bound to see something like this eventually Now that I ve told you all the bad things about the 95 Ford Windstars I ll talk about the good things about it Performance  The engine had good torque and power at all speeds  The transmission shifted extremely smooth most of the time that we owned it  The gas mileage that we got was surprisingly good for a van with this big of an engine  Handling was alright for a van and the brakes worked really good  Comfort Features  The front seats were really comfortable  The back seats weren t great for long trips and were impossible to fall asleep in but our van didn t have the bucket seats in the back  it just had 2 benches  The buckets seats  actually called captains chairs I guess  are a lot more comfortable  The air conditioning worked great with the rear air  There are vents in the ceiling that work good to keep all passengers cool  You can close the vents if you want  The rear heater was awesome  I guess it was kind of a safety hazard as it could melt a plastic bag if one was left right next to the vent on the side of the floor  But it sure heated us up fast in the winter  There are plenty of lights in the van all the way to the back so you can see in the dark  There was 3 power outlets in the van which was handy  Sometimes I plugged in my Discman to the power outlet at the middle seat so I didn t waste batteries and on our trip to Florida we plugged a portable refrigerator thingy into the very back power outlet  This was really handy  The factory stereo only had a tapedeck and am fm but it was decent for a factory system  I also liked the design of the interior on this van  It was nicely done  It s hard to remember all the little features cause it was a while ago  but there were lots of them and it was nice Safety Most people know that the Windstar got rated for 5 star safety rating so I guess it s pretty good for safety in a crash  Not so safe to get stranded out in the middle of nowhere in the winter but at least your safe in a crash I guess Anyways  as you can see I have plenty of good things to say about the Ford Windstar but I don t think they re worth it unless you re rich enough to be able to afford the repairs  In that case you could probably buy something a lot nicer than the Windstar though  I have heard a lot worse  Windstar Horror Stories  than ours since we only had the 2 major problems  I bet that guy from Quebec could tell you a good story about his Windstar  The newer ones have corrected some of the problems but on www cartrackers com  forums and then go to the Ford Windstar page  its the only vehicle that gets its own forum on here  lol or go to  My Lemon  there still seems to be a lot of problems with the newer Ford Windstars  I wouldn t recommend one  
Neg, I HAVE EDITED THIS DUE TO A VERY MAJOR EXPENSE  ENGINE FAILURE  ON JANUARY 29  2000  PLEASE READ THE BOTTOM FOR NEW AND VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION From the time we picked up our 1995 Windstar  we loved the ride  But  as many new vehicles are prone to  this one was in the shop for tweaking a few times This was probably an omen of things to come  as we have had the brakes replaced at low mileage  and under warranty  because Ford claimed that they did not have the proper brakes to install in the first place when the vehicle was new  I still don t understand that one Also  the  quot Check Engine Light quot  is constantly on  We have had it checked out several times when the vehicle was under warranty and they have not been able to find any cause for it  nor could they fix it After the warranty expired  we needed to have the Windstar serviced again because of an antifreeze leak  this turned out to be a recall notice item  but still cost us plenty  The nearly  1 000 in repair bills was due to the structure of the engine which needed to be somewhat dismantled so that the mechanics could work on the problem  labor costs  Oh  they said that we could take the chance and not get the repair work done since it was so costly  but knowing that we could have major problems if we didn t fix it  what else could we do but shell out the money to Ford MY HUSBAND TOOK THE WINDSTAR IN BECAUSE OF STRANGE SOUNDS IN THE ENGINE AREA  2 WEEKS AGO  AND WAS TOLD THAT  AT 79 000 MILES  THE ENGINE NEEDED REPLACING  THIS WILL COST US  3 000  DOLLARS  THE EXTENDED 3 YEAR WARRANTY ON THIS WORK WILL COST ANOTHER  1 634 00  WHEN THE DEALER WAS CALLED YESTERDAY TO CHECK ON THE PROGRESS OF THE WORK ON THE REBUILT ENGINE  WE WERE TOLD THAT THE LIFTERS ARE BAD  TOO  THIS WILL ADD ANOTHER  200 00 TO THE COST  You bet Ford will get a letter on this one AND THEN SOME I thank goodness for the communication possibilities of the internet because I did a search on  quot Ford Windstar Recall Notice quot  and was alarmed to find that thousands of people who have purchased the 1995 Ford Windstar are having similarly costly expenses and all seem to be pretty much the same in the nature of the repair work  Although it is comforting   to know that we are among a large group of people having the same wallet draining experience  I believe that it is time for the rest of the  quot silent majority quot  to speak up  If enough of us get to the point of saying  quot I m not going to put up with the way we re treated by the Ford Motor Company quot  we should be able to force Ford to put out a recall on the engine so that they must pay for the trash we are stuck with One last note before I end this ranting  through my research of dissatisfied customers on the internet  I learned that the recall notice on the head gasket problem was apparently not received by everyone  If you have not received this important notice  be sure to contact Ford  for whatever good that will do br br  
Neg, I bought this vehicle when expecting my first child  We chose the Windstar because it had excellent safety ratings  I like the way the minivan looks and rides  I have enjoyed the car overall until the last 3 months or so  I received a Recall in  98 on a certain engine part that could cause the head gasket to blow  I took the van to my local dealer  from which I bought the vehicle  and they claimed to find no problem and therefore would not replace a part that wasn t broken  The exact thing that the recall was for happened in November  99  I was informed that the recall had expired and they could do nothing for me  I had the problem fixed by an independent mechanic Approximately two weeks later I received another recall on the fuel tank  This time stating that it could fall off the vehicle  I definitely feel that unless you are willing to deal with the recalls and repairs you should not purchase this van  I do not know of the status of the newer models  but I am not willing to take my chances and buy another Ford Windstar br br  
Neg, And I thought quality was Job 1  HA At 40 000 miles I replaced head gaskets and had the transmission rebuilt in my 95 Windstar  Ten months ago at 72 000 miles the engine was replaced  This is to say nothing of brake jobs every 25 000 miles and numerous electrical problems   I won t bore you with a long defense  but in case you re wondering  this van is not driven hard Today I learned that the head gaskets must be replaced again but that I am 4 000 miles over the 12 month 12 000 mile warranty  Ford refuses to bend the rules  Now they expect me to invest more than  1000 in head gaskets that may last  what  maybe 10 000 miles maybe 25 000  The bottom line is that they know this engine is flawed and they can t figure out how to fix it and they won t stand behind it Take my advice  if anyone offers to sell  or even give  you one of these things run away screaming  
Neg, I have 1995 Ford Windstar that now has 72000 miles on it  The van is great to drive and the interior has worn well and still looks great  But mechanically the poor Ford has had it I had to replace the head gaskets at 70000 miles  Which was a  1200 repair  This bothered me but I figured after 70000 miles it could be worse  I then found out that Ford knew this was a problem with all of their 3 8 liter V6 s that year and even had a program to replace the head gasket for free if the van had 60000 miles or less  I contacted my local Ford dealer and Ford s  quot Quality Care quot  department  both said they could be of no help because I had more then 60000 miles on the van  So I went ahead and had it fixed 3 weeks later while returning from a funeral out of town the van broke down and left me on the side of Interstate 81 in the middle of the night  I had the van towed back home only to find out that it had broken a connecting rod and I have to replace the motor  A  3500 repair My next vehicle will be an import  I also have a 1987 Toyota with 149000 miles and have never done anything to it but oil  tires  amp  brakes Maybe one day Ford will be able to build a quality product and when they let a bad motor get off the production line they should stand behind it br br  
Neg, My dad had always wanted a van  He had owned an LTD ford wagon  a white one with blue interior  It was the best vehicle we had ever had to this day  He decided to try ford again  He purchased a 1995 model  white paint and white interior It was a good vehicle for the first few thousand miles  Mind you as soon as the warranty expired  the transmission failed  It cost us over a thousand dollars to get it replaced  and to our disdain we find that the transmission was built with a plastic gear  Who in their right mind would place a plastic gear in a transmission Well  a few months later the head gasket broke  White smoke billowed out of the exhaust and the car overheated like mad  I did everything i could do to get it home  It cost us  1500 dollars to replace the head gasket  It ran fine for a few days  but a mysterious knocking and loss in power suddenly appeared  Antifreeze from the head gasket had worked its way down to the crankshaft and corroded the bearings  and because of this we had to replace to whole engine  With our horrible luck a week later we got a letter in the mail recalling our model van for the head gasket  And then  my father had to fight ford to pay us anything  Initially they offered to pay us for the head gasket itself  which was only  200  Then  he managed them to pay for the labor  the  1500  but refused to pay for the engine which had failed due to their faulty gasket  We lost  2500 because of Ford s incompetence The car ran fine for an other year until the warrantees on the engine and the transmission expired  Then  just our luck  the transmission failed again  I was driving one day and the car started jerking  Then it rode ok after i put some transmission fluid in it  but it wouldn t change out of second gear  We had it overhauled and they couldn t believe the condition of the transmission  They thought it was the original transmission and thought the van had to at least have had over 100 000 miles  but their jaws dropped when we told them the transmission was less than a year old A few days after that  the engine started overheating  It would overheat momentarily and then suddenly it would go back to normal  In the end it was the head gasket  again  This time they said  2500  My dad said forget it  We traded it in for a Pontiac Grand Am after that  which is a great car  We love it  Someone bought our van  by the way  For  2000  Didn t even get it off the lot  the engine locked up on them Ford called our house shortly after we bought our new car  They said it was time for our 85 000 mile checkup on our van  My dad just shook his head and hung up on them br br  
Neg, We purchased this van to provide adequate space for our family during travel  Boy did we get more than we expected  This Van has not only provided us with the space we needed but we also have so many options and luxuries  Beginning with the outside of the van  We bought a 95 model the paint is in immaculate condition  Looks brand new   two tone paint green and tan Love the combination Engine  Clean  runs great  sounds and drives like brand new van  Not bad for 5 years old  Looks like this one may be worth the money Interior  Excellent  Spacious  Comfy seating with adequate leg room  Not cramped  Many options inside   ie  lumbar in front seats  adjustable seat belt height  heated outside mirrors  and lots of extra storage room  The inside is my favorite part  I just cannot believe how nice this van is My overall opinion is  spend the money and purchase this van  It is well worth every cent  I love mine and when the time comes to retire it I will surly purchase another Ford Windstar br br  
Neg, Owners of the 1995 Ford Windstar should be aware that the 3 8 liter engine is VERY PRONE to early head gasket failure and FORD will not reimburse owners if the mileage exceeds 100 000 miles  FORD customer service is virtually impossible to obtain and FORD dealer service is generally below average for Windstar problem areas  High failure areas on the Windstar  in addition to the head gasket  are the electronics  sensors and rear brakes  A class action lawsuit was filed against FORD Motors on behalf of 1995 Windstar owners with defective head gaskets by a Chicago law firm on December 12  1999  If you wish to join the lawsuit  e mail your request to Lawyers mylawyers com Their website is mylawyers com Also notify the National Highway Transportation Safety Board at 800 424 9393  Please notify NHTSB because if enough pressure is brought to bear on Ford  they may  quot do the right thing quot  and reimburse owners for the defective head gaskets br br  
Neg, PLEASE DO NOT BUY A WINDSTAR There are LARGE NUMBERS of owners experiencing mechanical problems with the Ford s 3 8L head gasket engine  including Sable Taurus  etc  You are welcome to read my earlier Windstar review on June 8  2000  In addition to the computer  brakes and head gasket  the Ford Windstar transmission is being mentioned more frequently on the Net as a problem area  I bought a 1995 Windstar new and like the roominess  comfort and safety rating  HOWEVER  the Honda Odyssey Toyota Sienna is just as safe  slightly smaller  more quiet inside  and MUCH MORE RELIABLE  Please do not take my word for it  simply go to the Net and read the information yourself BEFORE buying a Windstar  Start with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administrations consumer complaints  http www nhtsa dot gov cars problems complain Others include http home att net 7Eccatanese ford Fordmanx htm and http www lemonaidcars com home htm and http home att net 7Eccatanese ford mainx htm Please read these Windstar horror stories BEFORE you purchase one  Also  I request that you spread the word to family and friends ASAP as to the location of these websites  My Ford dealer refused to provide the name or number of the District Service Rep  Next I tried the Ford Consumer Help line waste of time and totally useless since they are not empowered to offer financial assistance  only the District Service Rep can do that Welcome to Ford s Catch 22     
Neg, This van is great for families who have several kids with lots of friends  It is safe and comfortable  but it has had MANY MAJOR reliability problems over the past years  and has NOT been driven that much  Seriously investigate reliability before purchasing  The options you have to buy to make this a decent car  power windows  locks  make the price uneccisarily high  Overall  I would not purchase this vehicle without some kind of statement guarantee additional insurance from Ford  But I must say  this van has tons of cargo room and seating comfort  especially with the captain seating option  We bought this vehicle to haul seven people around town  but we have used it for schelpping ping pong tables  trampolines  and more     
Neg, When we found out about our 3rd pregnancy  we also found out that our nice Explorer had to go  Why  Because our 3rd pregnancy was resulting in our 3rd and 4th children yep  twins  We looked at several used models and finally settled on a 1995 Ford Windstar GL  It had less than 30 000 miles on it and had been a rental model for the dealership so we felt fairly confident it had been serviced properly  But alas  this was not to be  During the time we owned our Windstar  it came under various recalls  Each time we took it in  it wouldn t be properly repaired and the recalled item would have caused more damage to the engine that would not be covered  resulting in money out of our pocket  It drove fairly well more like a car than a van  But the steering ratio was horrid  Although we were told the van was the  quot largest among the minivan class quot  we soon discovered this was not interior space  As our kids grew  the van became smaller and smaller  An adult could not comfortably squeeze into the 3rd row seat at all  Door latches broke  power windows malfunctioned  cassette player stopped working  And that was in 2 years of ownership  In fact  our Windstar was traded in for our new Dodge Grand Caravan while in the shop for yet another repair  Ford says its improved the Windstar  I hope for the sake of consumers out there putting their trust in them  they have  As for me  once bitten  twice shy br br  
Neg, Dear  Reader  I regret to inform you that Ford motor company has the worst minivans in the world  I bought a 1995 Ford windstar and since 4 months after I bought it Air Conditioner problems arrive  A faulty clutch in the A C didn t allow the A C to run so my engine will keep every 2 minutes going up and down in the RPM  Not to mention my major overheating during a 2 mile trip to church  During that trip I got so mad that I went to church and drove back home with a white smoked cloud and the temp gauge in the H  At the end a head gasket problem  water pump  and a Catalytic Converter full of  Antifreeze Coolant  try to beat that one  My tires lack of pressure all the time and aligment is done every 4 000 miles  Fuel economy is actually called Fuel Waste  13Mpg in my Windstar  The bench are 150lb each and the rear vent windows don t open anymore  My plastic headlights cover turn in to a crack yellow color and the windshield washer work when it wasn t to  I am waiting to finish paying for it so I could just put it in front of a railroad track and see it blow  Probably with the 5star rating on accident I will need to put it two or tree times on the tracks  I almost forgot my sliding door don t close completely  If you look from the back you can see it slightly open  I don t even mention Ford recalls letter 17 in total  
Neg, I bought the 95 Ford Windstar due to our 2 year old daughter and our future children  My husband and I previously owned a Dodge Caravan we loved  We found the Windstar for a great price  8000  with 89 000 miles Lots of miles but looked in good condition  The van was great for the first 2 months then it got crazy  First trouble with the air which turned out to be the computer  500  Then it started overheating  We checked the thermostat no problem  On the way back from the beach we blew the head gaskets  1200  And now the transmission is acting iffy  And at this point we have so much money invested in the car we can t sell so we are stuck driving it until it dies  We had read Consumer Reports before we bought the van and it checked out  Unfortunately we didn t wait long enough because now it s coming out that it s a lemon  So buyer beware br br  
Neg, I am an extremely unhappy owner of a 95 POC Windstar w 120K miles  I am posting this so that potential Windstar owners know what to expect a few thousand miles down the road  It was a fight to get reimbursed for my blown head gaskets back at 57K miles  There is constantly something wrong with this car from electrical problems to AC problems  to electrical door lock problems   to chimes and warning lights always going off  I religiously maintain this car  following the Ford recommended maintenance to the  quot T quot  One month after my 120K maintenance in which they reportedly  quot inspect the engine cooling system quot  the POC left me stranded with a blown front cover gasket and a failed water pump  The repair shop told me the warning signs should have been visible during the  quot inspection quot  I have performed extensive research on Windstar problems and know my situation is not isolated  Both dealerships in the Charlton  SC area  Jones and Palmetto have lousy service departments and just give me the run around when I bring these issues up  So beware potential Ford Windstar Owners  Ford claims to have fixed the problem  but do you want to take the chance  Don t believe all the Ford Hype  Our 91 Honda is running like an old reliable clock at 140K with only routine maintenance  No equipment failures on the Honda and I hear the same thing from many Honda Owners br br  
Neg, Having been a FORD worshipper for many years  I have finally  quot de sourced quot  FORD as a supplier for my family cars  Dating back to to the late 1980 s  I had not purchased anything but FORD products  From a Taurus Wagon to two Escorts and two Explorers  FORD products were  in my opinion  the best quality cars suv s on the market  Lately though I have changed my mind  Yesterday I received my second recall letter in less than six months Everyone has heard of the Firestone fiasco  Today s recall concerns the suspension system  And over the years I have had a huge amount of trouble with the 4 wheel drive system  The new FORD Focus has been out for less than a year and has had 5 recalls already  What s going on  Since my company is a supplier to the automotive industry  I can only assume that FORD will be going steadily downhill  For the past 6 or so years  to boost their profits  they have demanded from all suppliers a 5  per year reduction in price  Their Q1 program is supposed to reduce costs such as waste  and inefficiencies to allow the supplier to pass along the savings  How many years in a row can you reduce your price and not cut back  Could you work for 5  a year less every year  Sooner or later you would need to cut back some critical area affecting your quality of life  Well the same is true with suppliers  you can only go so far  Some suppliers have redesigned their product so they can sell a cheaper product   Note  My company supplies a non critical item  My guess is that they are cutting corners in quality which passes the initial FORD testing but is failing in the long run  The blowouts involving Firestone were mainly on original equipment tires  not the aftermarket  I no longer trust FORD or their products  They are our worst customer I will no longer buy a FORD vehicle br br  
Neg, We own a 1994 Ford Explorer with the Eddie Bauer package  It s a great looking vehicle  all the comforts you d want  Leather seats  Lumbar  electronic everything  The most expensive component was the A C  It eventually started getting warmer and warmer and this year we took it in to be charged  Well  that model already used R 134  But Ford charges a fortune for it  Plus that had to  fix  the leak  where ever that was  A truck that s 8 years old didn t just spring a leak  They could have charged it up and it would have lasted another 8 years  But instead  they  fixed it  and the bill was  1200  Then a week later  when it finally got warm enough to use the A C  I tried it and the car died at 55 miles per hour  I had to steer up a hill and off the road  The compressor went out  AFTER THE FIRST USE  So back the the repair shop and  650 later we had A C  for two weeks  Then it quit being cold  We took it back and their new compressor had gone out  but I made them pay for repair  Another big headache was the Four Wheel Drive  I need the four wheel drive daily because I live atop a large  rocky hill  You push the button and the light comes on and you go up the hill  Well eventually it got harder and harder to climb and then you d have to romp up it in order to get home  Well  after spending  450 in tires in one year  I took it in  the Ford dealer told me they just get old and lose their power  Well I wasn t exactly convinced  I jacked it up and there was no power at all  I took it to a mechanic and he found the automatic hubs to be bad  Well  with the Explorer  you have to get them from Ford  no aftermarket available  So for  400 a tire I got my 4WD back  My last Chevy cost me  129 for a pair of hubs from Warn and I was back on the road  but it cost over  900 to get the Explorer working again  The vehicle has plenty of great featurs and it s comfortable  but the modern technology comes at a great price as it ages  
Neg, I purchased this vehicle in 1998 as it was coming off a lease  The mileage was low  and the body was in great condition  and when I drove it there were no problems  Since purchasing it though  we have had quite a few problems  Brakes went early  and of course you all have heard about the tire recalls  We also had to replace the front stabilizer bar several times  This was another recall  but as a second owner  we didn t hear about it  and had to pay for it ourselves  Finally  our transmission died with still low mileage on the vehicle  Doing some research online  I found that this problem has happened to thousands of Ford owners  and that Ford is aware of the problem  but is unwilling to help with costs  or to even address the issue  See this website for an example  http www carlounge com cgi carsbbs read php f 1 i 1722 t 1411  I decided to trade my car in  since the cost to repair or replace the transmission was estimated at  2000 3000  I didn t get a whole lot for it  certainly not blue book value  since dealers are having a hard time reselling Fords  I now have a used Infiniti Qx4 that has a 7 year  100 000 full warranty  Can t beat that  
Neg, Before I bought my  94 Escort Pony now gone  and in its place a  98 Sunfire GT  I owned a 1990 Ford Escort Pony  While not as refined as its successor  1991 models and later  the 1990 Escort did have some good features considering the price  In 1990 the Ford Escorts that were sold in America came with 2 engines  a standard 1 9 liter CFI  central fuel injection  that produced 90 horsepower at 4 600 RPM  and 106 lb ft of torque  A 1 9 110 HP  EFI  efficient fuel injection  engine is available for this year  only in the Escort GT i Driving Impressions i  My Escort Pony came equipped with the 90 HP CFI engine which gave this car  almost  adequate  performance  for hill climbing  but was shy of having enough power in high gear to make it up hills without lugging down  The 90 horsepower is reached at a fairly low RPM  so off the line acceleration is not too bad  but this car obviously was not made for burning rubber  The 4 speed is fairly low geared  I do not know the final drive ratio  however it s low enough so you can hear the 1 9 liter engine straining at highway speeds  The 4 speed manual also was not accommodating in town  as it would sometimes decide it did not want to shift into a certain gear at any certain time  Cruising on the highway  besides being noisy  is also bumpy  and aggravating  The suspension is unforgiving  and lets you know when you have hit a small bump  or even when passing over reflectors on the road  a hard jolt can be felt  Handling is inadequate  Significant roll can be felt  and without power steering in the  pony  models  you better have some muscular arms   Note b  Many options are available on other models  This review is based on a 1990 Escort Pony  The 1990 Ford Escort rides on a small 94 2  wheelbase  and has an overall length of 169 2  The  Suspension  consists of Macpherson struts up front with coil springs  and the same treatment in the rear i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  of the Pony is plain  and as basic as it gets  The dashboard is downright dated  and so is the rest of the interior  My Pony came with no options whatsoever  not even a stereo  Manual windows  and doors were a way of life  Arm rests on the drivers doors were of cheap plastic  but had fallen off after a few years of ownership  The drivers seat was not comfortable  and offered minimum support  the same can be said for the rest of the seats in this car  There is adequate room up front for small adults  but even the front is cramped  the rear was apparently made for children only  My Escort Pony was a 2 door coupe  so getting people in and out of this small car was a real pain  especially since the passenger seats would not fold forward all the way  Vision is limited  With the claustrophobic feeling cabin  and limited visibility  driving this car was no picnic   Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior  matches the interior perfectly  they are both plain  boxy  and offer a dated design  This car isn t going to turn any heads  except those who have joined the Ford Escort following cult  The Escort  which was given a face lift in 1988 does look a tad more sophisticated than its predecessor  but still lacks modern styling  Even back in 1990 this car was looked at as a dated design  In late 1990  as a  91 model  the Escort got a major face lift and interior engine changes which made its successor much more desirable   NOTE b  The 1990 Escort is offered in either a 2 door hatchback or 4 door hatchback   Price   Reliability  An Escort Pony in 1990 with no options would run you around 6 000 dollars  and 9 000 dollars for models like the LX  Today with poor resale  almost all models of the 1990 Ford Escort can be had for less than  2 000  I have seen them in papers for as low as  500 00 with claims like   runs great  As for reliability  My Pony was a real nightmare  Problems included  worn Cv joints   torn boots  Tears in the  pleather  trimmed doors  shifting problems  a multitude of interior Leaks  oil leaks  hatch struts went out  faulty gauges  overheating  drivers window would not roll up all the way  and rust was found in the fuel lines  All this  by the way  happened in less than 2 years of ownership  The car had less than 110 000 miles on it i Final Thoughts i A cheap car at a cheap price  The Pony is only recommended as a last resort and if you can get a extremely good deal on one  if not the 1990 Escort should be avoided Happy Car Shopping 
Neg,  A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME FIRST b  I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic  interior  power  warranty  options  etc  points of view  I believe an important  but always neglected area  though is from a steering and suspension system point of view  and let me tell you  most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed in this area  You can find some very well engineered and built suspensions these days  but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my experience  and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision  After reading my reviews  read some on other aspects of the car you re looking for from the experts here at epinions  and make your choice b NOW ON TO THE ESCORT b  This is about the older Ford Escort  the whole car including the steering and suspension system got a total re design for the 1991 model year  It was then that the car was based on the Mazda 323 when Ford and Mazda had somewhat of a merger  so this opinion is for the pre 1991 models  Having the constitution of the United States on my side is a very good thing  because there is not one redeeming quality about the suspension of the Escort  and if they could the Ford Motor Company and it s engineers would sue me for writing this  First off nothing is greasable on the Escort  and the tie rods  both inner and outer wear out at a rapid rate  as do the lower ball joints  The design of the suspension is such that there is quite an angle from where the inner tie rods screw onto the steering rack  down to the steering knuckle  and this angle dictates that there will be a small contact area where the ball on the rack end of the inner tie rod contacts the bearing surface  The smaller the area the faster it will wear  that s just basic physics  And that is exactly what happens  If the engineers designed it where the inner tie rods were more horizontally mounted  there would be more surface area contacted and it would not wear as rapidly  But now it s too late  they are committed to mass production  Even when you replace the factory unit with an after market part  the name s still the same  rapid wear  The lower ball joints are another sore spot  Not greasable and prone to rapid wear  The ball joints on this car are integrated into the complete control arm  so when the ball joint portion wears you have to replace the complete lower control arm  This includes both the bushing on the strut rod  and the inner pivot bushing  This could really be a good thing though  because you will get new bushings when you replace the ball joint  but if you don t need bushings you have no choice  and at over 125 00 each retail  it is an expensive repair to replace both sides  There are many problems with other portions of the suspension on the Escort too  like strut mounts and bearings  but suffice it to say I am not at all recommending any of you to consider a used older Escort  it just isn t worth it  Even if you got one really cheap  and got all of the front end parts replaced with lifetime warranty after market parts  they will wear out due to extreme angles of operation  And even though the parts would be covered with proof of purchase  and receipt from the garage you got it done at  the labor would have to be covered by you and the hassle of another trip to the garage and being without your vehicle is enough to shy you away from one The newer style Escort s are a completely different story  They are basically  like mentioned above Mazda 323 s  and are miles apart from the older models in quality  The only real problem with the re designed Escorts are the outer tie rod ends like the older ones are not greasable  and will wear out rapidly  If you are considering an Escort from 1991 and newer  it is a much wiser and acceptable decision  and you should be pleased with this model br br  
Neg, Thankfully I do not own this car  because if I did I would curse myself everyday for making such a terrible decision much as my boyfriend does  He bought this car nearly two years ago  I told him then not to buy it  and I still tell him now what a terrible deal it really was  I have had the misfortune  perhaps fortune since I will never have to deal with such an experience from this particular car  of being present and experiencing every single one of this cars downfalls since the day he bought it  Sometimes I even have to drive it myself when I am nice enough to let him borrow my wonderful Honda Civic For starters this car looks horrible form the outside  I have never been able to get over where the side view mirrors are placed  it looks absolutely ridiculous  to have them sticking out right in the middle of the front door rather than at the front like most cars  It is also very boxy in shape and is very high off the ground  The inside is not much better  there is hardly any interior room  and as unimportant as it is the controls are tacky and poorly placed This car has cost my boyfriend almost as much as he paid for it in repairs  and there is seriously always something wrong with it  things he can t afford to fix  He has to replace the transmission  the struts are crap and he severely needs new ones  it is so bad that you get a headache from all the bumps and vibrations  There were serious problems with the steering when he first got it that needed to be fixed immediately  it had alternator problems  and the list goes on  there have been so many repairs it s hard to keep track  Many repairs can be expected with a used car but this is ridiculous  However  the biggest problem with the car is not all the maintenance it needed and still needs  although that certainly doesn t help  it is how terribly this car handles  The shifting is terrible and even though this car needs a new transmission we were told that is always will shift poorly  It accelerates slowly and seemingly has no power  Perhaps the only good thing about this car is the fact that it is reasonable on gas  not great   but not horrible either I definitely would not recommend this car  it is known as a lemon among most people  If however  you do decide to purchase an escort I would seriously recommend getting it looked at by a mechanic to assess the cost of repairs before you buy it  So far you re probably thinking I m unreasonable in my assessment  but consider this  the car only had 46000 miles on it when he bought it  
Neg, Well  I don t exactly own this car  but I have driven in it plenty of times over the last few years  It is my neighbor s car and we used to go many places in it until I got my Corsica  This review is on a 90 Escort LX 2 door HB  THINGS THAT WENT WRONG This vehicle has only 98 000 miles on it but yet is breaks like it has 198 000 miles on it  This car needs one significant repair at least once every two months  Sometimes more  From what I can remember  these things went wrong Both door armrests and handles  inside  have fallen off The ignition system needed replaced radio died A C died the headlights broke  electrical  and cost well over  200 to fix washer fluid pump oil leaked and needed fixed water pump died map lights stayed on and would not turn off which drained the battery clock won t work right engine had some problems auto trans is going to go bye bye soon brakes wear out fast and there have been many more problems that I don t want to bore you with Now  back to the review Interior exterior The exterior is nothing special  however  the back end is quite nice looking  The wheel caps are nice too  The front end looks big and old with the large   80 s volvo like headlights  The interior is small and very cramped  The back seat cushion is tilted funny which makes it uncomfy  There is little leg room in all four seats The rear two seats have a lap belt with a separate shoulder harness  They each have their own buckle  There are coin holders below the shift lever and in the locking glove box  They add a nice touch  You have to be small to drive this car  Tilt wheel  What tilt wheel  This car doesn t have one  To me  a tilt wheel is a MUST  The seats are high off the floor and the lower cushions are thick  The sun visors are very nice and have a covered mirror with lights  This is a plus  Under the hood Under the hood of the LX  you will find a weak 1 9L four Cyl  engine  The brake oil washer fluid  and coolant fluids are easy to fill and find  The transmission and the power steering dipsticks are NOT EVEN LABELED  She had to go to Sears and ask a worker which was which  There is a light under there so you can see at night Please be sure to be VERY careful when buying this car  If you aren t rich  then DON T buy it           FYI  My neighbor bought a brand new 1994 Escort and sold it within a year because it was ALWAYS in the shop                       John9740a s own ratings  1 low  2 3 4 5 high Power 2 front seats 3 back seat 1 trunk 2 brakes 2 reliability 1 room space 2 overall 2 5 but due to reliability  I have to give it only   sad stars  
Neg,  The Product The 1990 Escort LX  the sporty version  is a four door with hatchback model that I have owned for the last year 1 2  I have driven approximately 2000 miles on it  This is due solely to the fact that there are parts missing from the transmission  I believe this is due to somewhat poor maintenance on the part of the previous owners and second due to that the transaxle on this model  down to the LX  is considered crap  Try auctioning for a 90 escort on ebay  If they list the cars faults  it ll be  busted transaxle  on there for sure The Experience I may be the only person alive that was excited to get an escort  I paid for it all by myself  cash  We were aware it had a  slow shift  but had no idea how long it was going to be before the car was a goner I ll tell you the exact expiration date  June 25th  2000  I was driving along on Kingston Pike in Knoxville  TN when I heard a fire engine  I glanced in my rearview mirror  and the guy in front of me  who I left  well  over two car lengths between  STOPS with SUCH SPEED  must be nice to have anti lock brakes a feature my escort didn t have  that I SLAM on my brakes and my brakes lock and I smash into him We patched up the car  We named her doo wop  as she had never bebopped in her entire 10year career as an automobile The car started having more trouble after we patched her up  The transmission fluid tube that runs from the resevior to the transaxle came off on the interstate and I had to exit with my lurching car to the nearest service station  The muffler fell off I bet it would have worked better if it were younger  
Neg, This was the worst car I have ever owned  Literally as the odometer rolled past 80 000  The fuel pump  tranmission  distributor cap  spark plug wires  CV axles  both  all went out  Sure you are thinking this idiot never even changed the oil  WRONG I know the importance of routine maintenance  This car couldn t hold up to regualr weart and tear  this must be why the Odometer has only 5 dgits on it it won t make it to six  I know the car was never intended to be built like a tank that s why it costs as little as it does  however everything is made of cheap plastic  lacking any quality and value to the owner  Also if you are even near 6 feet tall you will not fit in this car  front or back seat  
Neg, I bought this 1991 Ford Van to fit my family of 6 into  I loved it at first  Then things began to go wrong  I have owned it for 6 months and in that time  the starter  the wiper motor  and heater have gone out  I am also experiencing some larger engine troubles but I realize that mine was probably the product of someone before me not taking very great care of it  Besides the obvious mechanical problems nearly every screw has backed out and everything wiggles and giggles and rattles  You tighten it  it loosens  There is also a stationary seatbelt in the middle seat which has injured several people getting into the van  When I replaced the wiper motor I noticed the one I took out was a refurbed one which meant this was the third possible wiper motor on this car  Otherwise it has been great  it totes the whole lot of us around safely  It does magnificent in the snow  Is very roomy  The back seat is a little awkward to get into  It is very easy to drive and seems to be pretty powerful  Gets decent mileage around 22 miles a gallon It has never left me on the side of the road  And it has tons of space to take everything that everyone wants to bring  
Neg, I own a Ford Ranger  It is a love hate relationship  This truck has never failed to start  On the other hand  I have had myriad mechanical difficulties with it  Small things  like wires  fuses  and that damn check engine light that comes on at 50 000 miles even if theres nothing wrong  Also  it gets pretty awful gas mileage  But it wasn t overly expensive  for a truck  and it s great being able to haul any kind of stuff  Overall  I would say that I do not regret buying and owning it  but it has provided me with a few headaches  Just remember if you get one  that if your check engine light comes on at 50 000 miles  you may not need to pay for pricy repairs br br  
Neg, Why do I dislike the Ford Ranger  I purchased a 1998 Ford Ranger Super Cab  Things were great until I reached 37800 miles  2800 miles over the warranty  My Master Air Flow Valve went  My Driver side seat started falling apart  My Door Ajar light stays on  My Air Bag light on the dash board stays on  Well the Master air flow valve cost me  495 00  I am still fighting about the rest  When I asked the dealership about the Air flow problem they told me that this should not have gone  When I contacted Ford s Customer service all I received was 10 promises that either the dealerships manager would call or the Regional Ford Sales manager would call  Well that was in November of 99 and still no call  Trust me DO NOT PURCHASE A FORD  In my eyes they are not worth the problems  I am looking for a manufacture who stands behind there product  Perhaps a Toyota  Again please use extreme caution when buying from Ford  Quality is not JOB 1 at ford Sincerely     
Neg, This car is great the first couple of times you drive it but then the buyers remorse kicks in  I have owned this car for over 1 year First the good things  This car is fast and has good power throughout the power band  I really like the nine inch wide tires and supercharger and the car drives great on the highway Now the bad things  Too many to list  but I will try Really cheap carpeting  no floor mats either Aweful interior  Very cheap 1980s look and build quality Leather quality is poor Post antenna is an eyesore Engine is very noisy  Very audible engine ticking and clanking Transmission gear noise  Thumping sounds when shifting Shifter is rubbery  and hard to find 3rd gear A good seating position relative to the shifter and steering is impossible to find Body panels do not line up at all Seating is below aceptable Lots of body roll  When you drive it  it feels like it is going to tip over  but it does manage turns good regardless Traction control doesn t work well  stalls out the car and causes wheel hop Very antiquated headlamp technology Have to bolt a license plate frame onto front  since bumper doesn t have it built in Exhaust note does not sound aggressive enough Rubber instead of polyurethane in much of the suspension Manual hood prop Plus  the premium SVT service you are supposed to get when you buy a Cobra is nonsense  I don t get any better service than someone who bought a Taurus  Ford still has not issued a recall on the ticking engines even though they know about the defect My first and last Ford  
Neg, My husband purchased a 1992 Ford Probe used in 1997  It already had 100 000 miles on it  Unfortunately  my husband was blinded by the sporty car that he could actually afford  He was just starting his career at that time  There were problems from the start of his even considering this car On the lot  there was a newer model Ford Probe with less miles  Obviously it cost more  Well  my husband really liked this car  The salesman got him really interested in that car and offered for him to drive it off the lot on Saturday night and come back Monday to work out specifics  Thankfully  my husband did not take up that offer  I should also mention my husband was in a hurry to get a car because his car had been stolen When he returned to the dealership the following Monday  the same salesman told him that he couldn t afford the newer Probe and had no memory of even offering it  Since my husband had gotten his heart set on this car  he settled for the older Probe  He got a pretty decent loan from Ford Credit Company and was paying about  200 month  He paid the blue book value for the car  Within 2 months  things were going wrong  Within 5 months  it became obvious that the previous owner had  quot worked quot  on the car  creating several problems  Besides the regular payment  the Probe was costing about  1000 in repairs every 3 months  That s a lot of money  Even though the car was sold qualifying under the lemon law  by the time there was enough problems to take action  the dealership was under new management and they supposedly could not do anything  Ford was contacted  but by the time they responded  the dealership had dissolved The final straw came when the drivers side window broke  It wouldn t roll up all the way  The estimated cost to repair it was over  500  Immediately  we started looking for another car  We pawned it off on an unsuspecting Saturn dealership in Tucson  who over valued the car  They told us they would auction it off for parts  so we didn t feel so bad  We were never happier to get rid of a car  We cannot recommend a Ford Probe to anybody  especially because the Probe model has been discontinued and you can only purchase it used at this time  Our treatment from Ford was also very poor  We won t be buying any Ford cars in the future  Please see my response to the  quot excuses quot  of why the problems of this car should have been expected in the comments section br br  
Neg, Well where to begin  I purchased the 95 Ford Aspire in 1999  It was a great deal I paid 4000 bucks for it and it only had 24 000 miles on it  It was my first car so of course I was in love with it That changed as the years went by First of all  the Ford Aspire is one of the Ugliest cars you will ever see  It got to the point that I was embarrassed driving it  Don t even try to put a spoiler on it that makes it worse  Also my car was red when I bought it and orange 4 years later even with a fresh wax job it still looked orange  That s the outside of the car  The inside isn t much better  The fabric they used to make the seats was ripping when I purchased it if that tells you anything  WOW  and it was so ugly  So if you like getting teased for the appearance of your car this is the car for you  My dad thought it would work well for either a go cart or a golf cart  and one time when the aspire was broken down  my father thought he could just go pick it up and put it in his trunk instead of spending the money to have it towed Another downfall was the fact that the car didn t come equipped with ANYTHING well  except wheels  The 95 Aspire does not have Power Steering  This is horrible especially if you are used to having it  I eventually got sort of used to it as my arm muscle started getting stronger  Parking is almost impossible in tight spots unless you are HEE MAN  The 95 Aspire also does not have rear defrost this is nasty especially if you live in Minnesota like I did  I felt like I was scrapping the inside of my windows more than the outside  Some other features that the 95 aspire does NOT have are cd tape player  cruise  and air conditioning As my car started getting older I felt like there was always something wrong with it  I think I had oil leaks about 50 times  the brakes had to be fixed often  and the saddest of all was the time I hit a pot hole and the front wheel axle literally broke in half  I put more money into the car than I paid for it originally So needless to say  when I got in an accident with it 7 months ago  I was relieved to see it totaled  How embarrassing to get in an accident and have little orange pieces of plastic scattered around not to mention the styrofoam that was revealed underneath  R I P  Ford Aspire  
Neg, I currently own an Aspire and there are some good things about it and some bad things about it  One of the great things about this car is the mileage  I can fill it up and it will go forever  However this car really does not handle well  One gust of wind  and I am blown all over the road  I recently had a blow out going about 55 mph on the highway  The driving conditions were ideal  but I my car was thrown into the side railing of a bridge and the damage accrued from this simple blow out is going to be about  2000 dollars  This estimate is the average from 3 body shops  When the blow out of my tire occurred I really did not realize how much damage the little bang had done until I tried to change the damaged tire  These cars are not made well  I would not call them safe cars because of the amount of damage I sustained from such a seemingly simple fender bender     
Neg, Ford Motor Company makes many vehicles in all sorts of sizes to accommodate the needs of its customers  Some are large and heavy and drain the gasoline faster than a reservoir following a dam burst  Others are more economical and can really help stretch your fuel dollars to the fullest  One vehicle that fits into the latter category is the  2003 Ford Focus   a smaller vehicle designed with economy in mind   Features Options b Ford Focus comes in several different body styles  Hatchback  Sedan  and wagon  This review will center on the sedan style  With the sedan  you can choose among three different trim levels  LX  SE  and ZTS  These three trim levels are arranged in order of price and overall luxury  with the LX being the most basic  the ZTS the most luxurious  and the SE falling somewhere in the middle of the two  Each of these three trim levels seats five and comes with a standard option package that includes most of the usual bells and whistles that one expects nowadays  tilt steering wheel  automatic transmission  manual is an option  front air bags  power windows and locks  3 year  36 000 mile warranty  CD player  etc  There are also a few unique options that are standard with the Focus  like child safety locks  along with optional features like leather  heated seats  heated mirrors  and Audiophile Sound System  Fuel economy is very good with this model from Ford  The LX and SE models both have mileage ratings of 27 36  The ZTS rates slightly lower  with 26 34  This is due to the somewhat larger  more powerful engine in the ZTS  a 2 0 liter Zetec engine with 130 horsepower  The other two models have an SPI engine with only 110 horsepower  All three models are available only with 4 cylinder engines b Price b Ford Focus will appeal to many people for one simple reason  the low price  The invoice price on the three models is approx   12 400 for the LX   13 900 for the SE  and  14 700 for the ZTS  Adding options will  of course  increase the price by a couple thousand or more  But the overall cost is still low when compared to the average vehicle   Final Thoughts b  The 2003 Ford Focus Sedan is a simple vehicle with a few nice features combined with some real annoyances  Let s talk first about the good points  Besides the low price  this vehicle does offer a reliable  responsive steering system that makes turning a breeze  Braking is quick and reliable and there is very little vibration or noise  even at high speeds  The price is low  too  and the smaller engine equates to greater fuel efficiency Cargo space is also very good with the Ford Focus  The trunk contains about 13 8 cubic feet of usable storage area  and this can be increased with the fold  down rear seats  The large trunk was one of the first things that caught my attention when I first examined this vehicle  I m always looking for additional storage space  and a large trunk is an important consideration when I m judging the merits of a car  Now  let s talk about the negative aspects of the 2003 Ford Focus Sedan  First of all  I got really annoyed with the seat belt beeper  This is a safety reminder that is becoming more and more common in newer models of cars  It beeps at you until the driver gives in and fastens the seat belt  Seat belts are a good idea  of course  but it gets really irritating listening to that beep  Another annoying sound is the turn signals  They make this awful tic  toc sound  similar to what you hear with a wind  up clock  I didn t think the comfort was all that good in this vehicle either  From the driver s seat  I felt a little bit tight  even after adjusting the seat backward  I felt like I was too close to the wheel  This vehicle cannot be recommended for very tall people  I can t imagine how an individual over  say  6 6  could fit themselves comfortably into this small space  Probably the greatest strike against Ford Focus however is the weak acceleration  The 110 horsepower engine in the LX and SE trim levels operates with a single overhead cam and two valves per cylinder  This provides enough power for easy driving in the city  but once it comes time to accelerate quickly  the Focus has a difficult time gaining ground  This is especially true when the air conditioner is running  I often found that  to pick up sufficient speed when entering the ramp of an interstate highway  I was forced to temporarily turn the a c off  I m afraid that 110 horsepower just doesn t cut it when it comes to quick get up and go  The ZTS trim has a little more power  130 horsepower  but not by much  I didn t drive the ZTS  but I doubt that the additional power of 20 horses would make a significant difference  Of the three sedan trim levels  the ZTS is a little more sporty and it offers the most options  But the Focus overall is not a very fun vehicle  I have read many reviews of the Ford Focus that try to hype it up and make it sound like a enjoyable car for young people  but I fail to see their point  It might free up some cash flow  because the price is so low  to spend on other things  but the fun  with Ford Focus  ends right there  My bottom line on this vehicle is that it s a very basic  simple  practical car for money  conscious consumers  With an invoice price range from  12 400 to  14 700  14 500 to  18 750 retail  the 2003 Ford Focus Sedan will likely remain a popular choice for millions of Americans who are sick and tired of flushing so many dollars down the drain to make a car payment and to pay for fuel  For myself  I will stick with the more enjoyable vehicles that cost a little more and guzzle a little more gas  They might cause a greater feeling of lightness in my wallet but they are also more in tune with what I want in a vehicle and what I am willing to pay for  The 2003 Ford Focus Sedan is inexpensive  but it fails to excite or even to satisfy  Unless your funds are tight  I recommend focusing on something a little more enjoyable  
Neg, I recently had to rent a car to carry a bit more stuff than I could get on the back of my bike  Harper Rental  in Hilo  Hawai i  assigned me a 2003 Ford Focus sedan with 8 365 miles on it  When I rode over to pick it up  and first saw the car  I thought   Gee  That s kinda pretty  I won t mind driving that around  Well  it was nice in the PARKING LOT  I was very grateful for the nice water tight windows  and the heater air con  But once I had loaded my amp a Fender Accoustisonic Jr  not terribly big or heavy  a couple of small drums  other percussion  and my costumes  I had to pretty much floor the gutless wonder to make the speed limit going up the Volcano Highway  This made me think it would probably be a lousy family car  unless you just tool around town and use it for grocery runs so it doesn t have to work very hard  Mashing the accelerator to stay with traffic sucked the gas down  so I lost any fuel savings associated with such a lightweight car  Acceleration was sluggish  so I was unable to pass any of the heavy equipment or horse trailers  which were averaging about 50 mph  This made me really wonder what it would have been like with four adults sitting in it  No idea what kind of engine was in it  but whatever it was  the exercise wheel could have used an extra mouse  or even an upgrade to a mouse or a gerbil  Perhaps adding a rubber band auxiliary engine would have helped  Hmmmmmm      Guess I wasn t at all impressed with the powerplant  Handling was pretty decent  though  On the return home  making the downhill run  the car had no problems staying with traffic  and handled quite well  Nice and tight steering  excellent cornering capability  comfy seating  At 5 3  tall  when I stand up reeeeeaaaaalllly straight  I found the leg and head room to be fine  I did bump my head once when I was squirming around trying to adjust the seat  so my 6  Sweetheart may not have been as comfy  While the trunk CAPACITY was excellent  I found the high lip on the trunk painfully inconvenient  Lifting all of my gear that high was very hard on my back and shoulders  I almost couldn t get the heavier stuff into the trunk  and getting it back out was worse  I did like how far forward the load can sit  so the tail doesn t overload and lighten the front end  
Neg, MY EXPERIENCE I test drove a 2003 Focus LX sedan at a local dealership  My test drive lasted about half an hour  and consisted of winding secondary roads and the freeway  PERFORMANCE The Focus has many strengths  but straight line stomping is not among them  The engine in the LX model that I drove was among the weakest in the budget sedan brigade  putting out just 110 horsepower  Although acceleration felt adequate around town  the Focus felt decidedly flat footed on freeway on ramps  even when I wasn t pushing it  When I floored the throttle for maximum acceleration  the sensation was akin to driving through deep sand and the engine wasn t very quiet about it  either  Most car magazines have quoted the LX s 0 60 times around 11 seconds  which isn t awful  but places it among the slowest brand new cars  To be fair  this relative lethargy is less pronounced in other Focus trims that aren t all that much more expensive  For example  the SE gets a 130 horsepower engine  along with a CD player and other useful niceties  for a little over  1 500 more  That trims the 0 60 time down to a more reasonable 9 5 seconds or so  and although I haven t driven a Focus with this engine  it s likely to add a measure of confidence in freeway merging that the LX model was short on  TRANSMISSION CLUTCH The Focus  transmission shifted well enough  but lacked a precise  mechanical feel that would have made it fun  The shifter finds the gears accurately I never missed a shift but it has long throws  and its action feels mushy  Similarly  the clutch engaged very smoothly  making it nearly impossible to jerk the car during gearchanges  but it had a long throw and engaged way up at the top of the pedal travel  which made for lots of left leg aerobics when driving around town  STEERING HANDLING The Focus fares much better in this area  Its road manners have a distinctly European feel to them which comes as no surprise when you consider that the Focus was designed in part by Ford of England  with the European market in mind  Its steering was firmly weighted and responded quickly  with a solid  decisive feel that inspired great confidence on twisting roads  There was also an unusual amount of road feel coursing through the wheelrim  an unusual quality in a low priced car  and one that allowed me to intuitively judge how much grip was left when I was driving hard on a twisty road  The steering feels just a touch squirmy on center  but is otherwise second only to the Mazda3 s for feel and precision  The Focus s soft suspension allowed quite a lot of body lean in hard turns  which was unsettling at first  but once I learned to trust the Focus s chassis  I found it a capable handler with plenty of grip in reserve on winding roads  Two thumbs up for European driving priorities  and their positive effect on the Focus s excellent dynamic qualities  RIDE Another impressive quality of the Focus is how well it rides  Usually  agile handling cars make some noticeable sacrifice in ride comfort due to their stiff suspensions  but not the Focus  Its ride is quite soft and absorbent  soaking up bumps and ruts quietly and without harshness  Damping is a bit on the soft side  meaning that the car bobbles over dips and humps in the road  but most of the time it simply swallows the bumps without disturbing passengers  As mentioned before  the engine isn t all that quiet  but road and wind noise are pleasantly muted  INTERIOR The Focus s interior isn t perfect  but it competes very well with the best in class  There was a surprising amount of room inside  both front and rear  and space was especially generous overhead it felt like I could have worn a ten gallon hat while seated  if I was for some reason possessed to do so  All the Focus s controls were easy to see and use  and while they didn t operate with the well oiled silkiness of the Corolla s or Civic s controls  they were easily superior to the crackly switchgear in other domestic alternatives like the Chevy Cavalier and Dodge Neon  There has been a good deal of griping about the Focus s front seats in the automotive press  but I found them plenty comfortable during my test drive  And while the high  upright driving position wasn t to my liking  I can imagine many buyers would love the commanding  minivan like view of the road it provides  There were only two notable caveats in the Focus s cabin  One was the materials  which were predominantly cheap  hard plastic  detracting from the sense of quality  The other was the distracting styling of the dashboard  where numerous slashing curves and unusual angles competed with the road for my attention during my test drive  PRACTICALITY I ve already mentioned the expansive interior  but it s worth mentioning again as it adds a considerable measure of practicality to the Focus from the inside  it feels like a much bigger car  The trunk is also quite spacious for a small car  and a standard split folding rear seat makes it all the more flexible  For further utility  buyers can choose from a five door hatchback style  the ZX5  or a conventional station wagon  While I haven t driven either of these models  their behavior should be identical to that of the sedans  while adding a measure of cargo hauling ability and uniqueness  RELIABILITY Ah  here s the rub  The Focus is quite a good little car  but according to Consumer Reports  its reliability is Much Worse Than Average a fairly scathing criticism  And while this is purely anecdotal evidence and far from conclusive  one of my friends who bought a Focus recently would certainly agree with CR s findings his water pump broke twice in one week  stranding him out of town for days  OVERALL So frustrating I really liked this car in nearly every respect  and yet I can t give it my recommendation  Although it s a fresh  modern design  and its road manners are fun and engaging  its very poor repair record was more than enough to temper my enthusiasm  and I simply can t give the Focus the nod with a clear conscience  As good as this car is  there are others  like the Civic and Corolla  that drive just as nicely and aren t nearly as likely to give you problems  A new car should give its driver total peace of mind  and that s something the Focus may not be able to deliver  
Neg, I own a 2000 Eddie Bauer Explorer  The car is nice  has all the whistles and bells that someone could want  and it rides decently  But within the first year of ownership  I have had numerous little problems  that have turned out to be major inconveniences  The rear windshield wiper would not work properly  The door locks didn t work  Warning lights come on for no reason and the dealer has  to this day  been unable to find the cause  What s worse is dealing with Ford and their dealers  Oh  they do an absolutely great job with customer service  always promising that they will do whatever they can  apologizing for all the frustration  etc  In fact  I would say they have the best trained customer service departments I have seen anywhere  However  its one thing to be nice and say all the right things on the phone  but its another thing to be able to actually resolve the problem  Their cars have so many little things that go wrong  and its surprising how ineffective they are in fixing them I would estimate that in the first year of ownership  I have actually only had the car 10 months  It has been in the shop for at least 2 months of ownership  Little stuff  big stuff  it doesn t matter  This car has the problems  
Neg, 1995 E 150 Econoline  conversion by d Elegant  300 I 6  E4OD  3 55 1  aftermarket interior and exterior  7000  GVWR  aftermarket rear heat and a c Background I have owned and driven Ford vans since I was 16 years old  I started out with a 1970 E 200 with 240 cid I 6  I have owned Ford vans with almost every engine available in them  I have used Ford vans for solo commuting  recreation  hauling band members and band equipment  hauling merchandise for distribution  hauling freight in the  quot Just In Time quot  expedited freight business  hauling students  and now pulling my 25  travel trailer Currently I own a  94 E 350 Clubwagon Chateau  460 V 8  E4OD  4 09 1 differential Formerly the topic of this review  I owned a  95 E 150 Econoline conversion van  conversion by d Elegant  The front suspension on this van was bad from the day I bought it with 43 000 miles  It was back at the selling Ford dealer about 5 times within the first month  and then other Ford dealers and alignment shops thereafter  The last alignment that I had done was at a reputable truck spring shop  They told me that the front coil springs were almost worn out  Because of the aged springs  they had to change the bushings on the ball joints to the maximum angle to align the van  They stated the condition of the springs and bushings on their invoice and stated that the next time it is aligned  it will need to have the front coil springs replaced before they will align it  I know that this shop is reliable and trustworthy  but what about the selling Ford dealer  I had the salesman write in the sales agreement that the van would be properly aligned BEFORE I took possession of it  Well  I found out that it was never on an alignment rack before I took possession of it  After the sale  the service department at McCandless Ford in Mercer PA gave me nothing but lip service about aligning it  They even sent me out on the road with the technician so that I could approve the work  Well it felt good on the 2 lane road that we drove it on  but it pulled when I drove it home on the interstate  That is when I made the appointment at the spring shop to take a look at it  I think that Ford had a problem with the E 150 chassis in  95 and nobody told me about it The 300 I 6 engine was very economical  I normally got 18 20 mpg hwy  but it dropped drastically to 10 mpg pulling the trailer  A quiet engine  good torque  but no power to pull our 25  travel trailer up hills and keep up our speed  There was no room for acceleration when pulling the trailer The E4OD transmission didn t do to much hunting  However  I stopped the hunting by locking out OD when it would downshift the first time  I would then ride out the hill in 3rd or 2nd The 3 55 1 differential gave me no problems The conversion company is d Elegant  The short comings that I found with the d Elegant conversion is the bay windows by Creation  seating by Dygert  sub of Flexsteel now  and the aftermarket rear heat and A C  I experienced the wind whistling in one of my bay windows  I found the rear chairs to have seats as hard as rocks  and I found the after market air to be really weak as far as the blower and the freon  There is more to a vehicle than a pretty looking interior and exterior paint job This E 150 had a tow rating of 5000  and I bought a travel trailer with a 4900 GVWR  The 300 I 6 in stock condition would pull the trailer well if my speed was under highway speed  However on the highway  I could not ever maintain the speed limit if I were pulling any degree of upward grade  In fact  I was often locked out of OD to pull grades and even sometimes in 2nd gear to pull big hills  While the E 150 was good for economy  it was not a good camper toter I would recommend the drive train to anyone wanting a dependable truck engine  who is going to use it at lower speeds  I would not recommend it to anybody who is doing alot of highway travelling  I would not recommend any conversion van to anybody because the parts that the converters use I replaced this  95 E 150 with a  94 E 350  In the deal I got OEM quad seats  6 way power driver s seat with lumbar support  OEM rear heat and air  OEM windows  heavier front coil springs  heavier tires  heavier rear suspension  I am very pleased with my trade br br  
Neg, The Ford Econoline van was not only a mechanics worst nightmare but also the owners  This van had numerous problems including severe break problems and an overall rough ride from light suspension  The brakes had to be replaced at least every four months and the suspension seamed to always  quot bottom out quot  and not provide enough suspension for even the regular trip around town  Sure this van was nice for carrying people and cargo but mechanical problems put this van on the bottom of my list  So if your looking for a van out there I believe that you should shop around some more and definatly not look in to the Ford Econoline van unless your up for a rough ride and spending money on brakes every four months  I really do not recommend this van to anyone  The ride was horrible  it got about ten miles to the gallon on gas  and used up your money in many other ways br br  
Neg, My 1996 Probe SE was a gift to me  and the buyer got a great deal on it  at least that s what I thought at first   Appearance  The Probe is a great looking car  Some say it looks like an artificial sports car  but with the sleek styling and flip up headlights  it s got a very sporty look  It even had a small rear spoiler  which added to the sportiness  The shape of the Probe makes its length a little longer than I tend to like  It s difficult to park the car a lot of the time  The strangest thing about the Probe are the windows  There is no frame around the windows  and the doors are sealed with a rubber molding around the door frame  The problem with this is that it makes it noisy  outside wind is easily heard  and easy to break into  All it takes is prying the window slightly and then using a wire hanger to unlock the door  My car was broken into and  cleaned out  much to my dismay The interior looks great  and the seats are similar to the bucket seats you see in many sports cars  The material and workmanship of the interior seems top notch  The rear seats are not roomy  and passengers in the back seat will often bump their heads on the rear window b Features  My Probe SE had some great features  including excellent A C  great pick up and handling  and a decent sound system  It is versatile for a sports car  since it is a hatchback  It allows you to fit a lot of things inside  although the sporty styling means less vertical space for transport   Ride  The car is a front wheel drive  and handles very well in the winter  It accelerates quickly  and handles very responsively  At times the ride can be a little rough  especially when going over bumps and potholes  but overall it handles like a dream  The automatic transmission makes for quick starts  and the shifting has a sporty feel  The RPMs will run high  then quickly shift to give the quickest acceleration  Despite the fast acceleration  it gets great gas mileage  I usually got 30 or more miles per gallon on the highway My chief complaint about the ride is the noise  As mentioned before  the windows are sealed with rubber molding but no frame  This means that wind noise can be heard through the window and rain can easily leak in  Sometimes  in fact  the window would roll down on its own  The engine also rattles and squeaks a lot b Reliability  Here is the Probe s weakest point  reliability  About two days after I got the Probe  the engine stalled while I was in Chicago traffic  It started again  but then after I stopped for gas I couldn t get it started  After having it towed I found out it was a bad connection between the battery and the engine  and cost  30 to fix  Little did I know that repairs were going to be much  much more expensive later on During the two years I owned the car  I had to replace the oxygen sensors twice  700 each time this happened  I had to replace the catalytic converter  800 with installation  and have minor work on the transmission  about  350  After I had given up a few limbs to pay for repairs and had complete preventative maintenance done on it  I figured it would run for a while with no problems  In 4 months the  check engine  light went on for the 3rd time  I was told that the car needed a new catalytic converter  just replaced a year before  new oxygen sensors  just replaced 4 months before  and electrical work  all which would add up to  1800  In the end  I decided to donate the car to charity  and bought myself another car  The gift would have cost me almost as much as the original amount paid  This car is great for people that don t mind frequent repairs  or those who are car enthusiasts who can do their own repair work  It looks cool  and it s so much fun to drive  Even the automatic has power galore  
Neg, I purchased a 1996 Ford Probe in May of 1997  It was brand new with only 15 miles on it when we got it  Very clean  very sporty  It was my first new car purchase ever  I thought I had the perfect car  WRONG  After only a month the A C went out  And in Texas summers an A C is a given  We took it in and discovered that our dealer wouldn t give us a loaner  even though it was only a month old  Eventually I got one anyway  The fixed the problem and we were on our way  A month went by and the same thing happened again  Again we got it fixed  This continued to happen at least 4 times over the next year or so  On top of the A C problems the brakes wore out after 25 000 miles  The tires were shot around 30 000 miles  The seats tore up  And the gas mileage was so so  When you drive down the rode it seems as if you are in a wind tunnel or something  And when it rained outside it usually rained in on us  Needless to say  after about 60 000 miles we traded it in just as the transmission was fixing to go out on it  By the way  to get a transmission fixed you have to fork out about 2500 bucks  And that will be a normal cost for about every 30 000 miles after that  Stay away from this and any other Ford if you can br br  
Neg, The Ford Excursion is the largest sport utility vehicle on the market  I would only recommend this vehicle if you REALLY need to tow 11 000 pounds b EXTERIOR   Like some SUV s on the market  the Excursion is based on a pickup truck  In this case it s the Ford F 250  As far as styling goes  I would call it  functional  but nothing more b INTERIOR   The wide seats are very accommodating  Power adjustable pedals are a nice feature  but I m a rather tall driver and thus have no use for them  There is a lot of head and leg room all throughout the front and 2nd row seats  even for me  Although the Excursion is not very aerodynamic  I feel it does a good job of keeping wind noise down to a minimum  not like a Lexus though  My test car has the diesel engine  It idles pretty loudly  The optional Reverse Sensing System helps a lot because  usually  the bigger the car  err  SUV  the bigger the blind spots  To me  an SUV of this size should only be used for towing or hauling  However  luxury options such as leather upholstery  an entertainment system  a CD changer  and even automatic climate control is either standard or optional depending on the model b ENGINE   There are gasoline engines available  but gas mileage with those engines are horrible  The diesel engine is a little more thriftier  The 7 3 liter POWERSTROKE turbocharged V8 diesel engine produces 250 horsepower at 2 600 rpm  and a substantial 505 lb ft  of torque at an extremely low 1 600 rpm  This may sound like a lot of power  but in my opinion  the 7 250 pound SUV NEEDS that kind torque just get moving  This engine serves only 2 purposes  Towing  and fuel economy  The diesel is more expensive to buy than the gasoline engines so take it for a test drive before you decide to buy one  All engines use the same 4 speed automatic transmission  I averaged 17 7 mpg in a mix of city and highway driving b HANDLING   This is the Excursion s weakest point due to its size  It s very ponderous on twisty roads  and has a huge turning circle  Getting in and out of parking spaces is like a chore to me  I m surprised there is even a limo version of the Excursion  The brakes feel strong  but it takes a bit longer to stop from speed than other  lighter   I m talking 5 000 pounds  sport utility vehicles b RIDE   Small bumps are easily absorbed due to the 137 inch long wheelbase  Hitting larger bumps  to me  can get annoying at times  Despite being so large  the Excursion feels very stable in a straight line b RELIABILITY   Although nothing too serious has happened  for a while I was hearing a popping noise coming from under the floorboard  I have yet to figure out what it is  but I will update this review as soon as possible b VALUE   Despite its drawbacks  the Excursion is a fairly good value  assuming you need the towing capacity  or room for 9  
Neg, My wife and I lease a 1997 FORD RANGER XLT  She absolutely LOVES it  but I wish I could drive it off a cliff When we purchased the truck in February 1997  it was a very sturdy truck  with power and comfort all together  However  after only 50 000 miles  it feels like it s falling apart at the seams  In Ohio  the highways and biways are constantly cracking and getting potholes in them  The bumps on the roadways are enough to make an airsick person want to fly to get around  What has happened over the past few years with this truck  is that the suspension is not shot  the steering is over sensitive  it seems lighter around corners  and all in all it makes me very uncomfortable driving it around Any vehicle that fish tails when it hits a little bump in the road while going around a gentle curve IS NOT SAFE  My wife gets studs put on the rear tires for winter driving  but we have to put 8 10 bags of sand in the bed of the truck for the studs to make any difference whatsoever  We did not get an extended cab  so needless to say  the seats aren t as comfortable as possible  However  FORD puts the seats so high up in the cab  that the roof seems too short  I am only 5 9  and I feel like I have to slouch to keep from hitting the ceiling The blind side is HUGE  This is because the rear window does not extend far enough to the side of the truck  to increase the peripheral vision The electrical system shorted out after only 1 year of driving it  For instance  if I want to turn the wipers on  I turn the knob  but have to wait for about 3 4 minutes for them to kick in  Then  after I turn them off  I ll be driving down the road a little way  and the HIGH SPEED wipers will just start going  AND I CAN T STOP THEM  I wasn t going to mention the fact that the WASHER FLUID dispensers don t work either  You may ask  Why didn t you take it to the shop to get it fixed  My answer  I did twice  They work for a couple weeks  or even a month  Then  it starts happening again Well  my wife loves it  That s why we still have it in the driveway  Next February  when the lease has expired  it s Bye Bye Ranger  
Neg, I bought my 97 Ranger in 2000 and must say that overall it has been a good vehicle  My two major gripes are the cabspace and lack of acceleration  On a short trip  10 Min  the Truck is fine  after that you ll start squirming and trying to stretch your legs if 6  tall or more Want to try and merge onto the freeway  DON T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT COWBOY  Unless you ve got a good 150 yard headstart  The gears are very tall  One minor gripe is the 2 spark plugs per cylinder  twice as expensive for tune ups due to double plugs and wires  Another gripe are the electrical problems  Ford is infamous for it s  Check Engine Light  Mine came on twice since I owned the truck Only one time did it cost me  Highlights are  Price  affordable  Utility  move stuff fridges  kegs  sofas  Durability  fairly low maintenance  
Neg, I bought a 1997 Ford Ranger to make a 6 500 mile trip from Alaska to the East Coast  I had made the same trip two years before with an 1987 Chevy S10  I got much worse gas mileage on a the Ford  which was 10 years newer  Also  the Ford would not handle the same mountains that my S10 had no problems conquering  I have not enjoyed my Ranger  because my Chevy ran and handled much better  and was 10 years older  I will never buy a Ford again  I recommend Chevy S10 for peace of mind on a long hard journey br br  
Neg, For the first four years of ownership  I loved my Ranger  Unfortunately  I held onto it for about 2 months too long So you ask what was the problem I had with mine  Here s the short list 1  Both O2 sensors burned out 2  The emissions computer crapped out 3  Multiple oil leaks 4  The transmission started to slip 5  Major crack in the intake manifold So you are probably saying that I beat my Ranger to death  right  Well  you would be wrong  I had a 4 liter  Supercab that I took meticulous care of  It was driven less than 15 000 miles  mostly highway  Aesthetically  it was in near mint condition  I regularly had it serviced  even had the transmission fluid changed a couple times  I was burned several years ago with a transmission that needed to be replaced prematurely  and swore that I would never let another one go due to the slightest hint of neglect When I was getting rid of my Ranger  I traded it in for a 2002 Toyota 4Runner  I couldn t bring myself to try to sell that crap can to an unsuspecting private party  my mechanic told me how several years ago Ford replaced the former metal intake manifold with a plastic one  no doubt to save  5 to  10 in the assembly plant So in the end  I can only warn people to beware of your Ranger when it hits that 60 000 mile threshold  You may be sorry They don t call the company F   ix O   r R   epair D   aily for nothing Sophiedog 
Neg, I had this car given to me as a rental from Enterprise  I had for one day because that was as long as I could deal with having it  I m used to cars that have a little up and go  So when I drove this car I was fairly upset with it  I went and a trip to another city which was about 90 miles away and it was the worst trip I had ever made  A diesel drove past me and I almost got sucked into it  It was awkward to drive and man was it ugly  The only good thing about this car was that it did have air conditioning and a tape player  It also got excellent gas mileage  But  man  what an ugly car br br  
Neg, I looked at all the other SUV s and chose a 1997 Ford Explorer XTL for the roomy and comfortable interior  Until approximately 24 000 miles my only trips to the shop were for oil changes  but problems have steadily come sice then  First came a problem with the accelerator sticking the dealer said that nothing was wrong  but 6 months later  Ford had a recall At 37 500 miles  just after the warranty expired the switch on the automatic seat broke and a week later the metal lever that controls the back of the seat literally broke in two  Next  I noticed a shaking sensation when braking replaced the brakes  but the problem remains  The check engine light came on which caused me to replace multiple sensors  It continued to glow then one day  it began flashing then went off  Also  the CD changer  installed in the console  only works sporadically  When I took it to the dealer while the warranty was still in  they stated there was nothing wrong  A clicking sound on the right side started somewhere around 38 000 miles  Later I noticed that my engine wasn t running smoothly  my Explorer was hard to crank  and it frequently chokes down  I have taken it to several mechanics to attempt repairs  but all of them have concluded that there is a crack in the intake manifold  a major repair that has to be done by the dealer  It has become unreliable  and I have been advised by 3 repairmen to trade it soon br br  
Neg, We purchased a used 96  Ford Aspire  It looked great  For a small car  it s even roomy  We got the two door  What a mistake  It s family unfriendly if you have small children in car seats  Getting small children in and out of the back is a pure nightmare in the making  You have to actually climb into the back seat to get them out  It s even tough to fit the carseat through the room you have between pushing the seat all the way up  You obviously can t put them in the front because of the air bags  This car is great on mileage  It s about the only plus to it  It s got no get up and go  My 86  Ford Tempo  which is ten years older  has more pick up and go than the Aspire  You can put your foot to the floor on the gas but you ll find yourself saying a prayer when you try to merge on a Freeway that you don t get hit because it takes you forever to reach traffic speed  There are only four seat belts in this car  Unlike most cars  there are only two seat belts in the back  instead of three  Why they didn t put one where there is obvious space for one  is a mystery  I get a work out just driving the car  Power steering my foot  You have to put a little muscle into turning the wheel  The brakes make up for that  They are super touchy  If you aren t very light on the foot  you will get to meet the dash in a sudden fashion  I notice they tend to lock easily  My husband drives this car the most and my older  beat up car is my preference compared  The Aspire might have air conditioning and a better stereo than my old Tempo but having to drive the Aspire just isn t worth the luxury of air and better speakers  This car would be great for a grandmother or your average  run of the mill  Sunday driver  It s slow  Obviously you need to not have small children with this car  It sure isn t child friendly for parents  I thought the hatchback would be nice with children  That was until I tried to fit a standard sized folded playpen into the back  That was difficult  very difficult  but finally accomplished  There is plenty of foot and leg room for such a small car but they sure didn t make the back storage area roomy  The seats do fold down in the back to make more room  That s wonderful unless you have children  In other words  if you need more room in the car to fit something in the back  I suppose you could strap the kids to the top of the car in their car seats  LOL  Although it is a funny image  of course that s not safe or legal  What was Ford thinking when they made this car  Obviously they weren t thinking about families  children  or their needs  I have dubbed the Aspire the new and improved version of the Pinto  I now know why there are so many used Aspires for sale  The original owners got smart and bought something else br br  
Neg, Ok  So my title is sort of a rip off from a funny movie but when I think about the Ford Aspire I had  that title is stuck in my head  I bought a 1996 Ford Aspire  I still can t tell you the exact color of it  It was a purple blue  It depended on the light outside or lack of  I should have been warned right there that maybe this car wasn t one to buy  Even the dealership couldn t name that color  The price was affordable  It matched my budget on payments  I thought it was kind of small but since I drive a lot  I didn t mind because I knew I d save a lot on gas money Reason one to hate this car is that it is small  While the seats in the back fold down to make more room if you want to carry something large  there really isn t that much space in the back  When the seats are up so you can have passengers in the back  the area in the back  this is a hatch back  no trunk  is very small  I discovered this after I tried to fit a few things in it after I bought it  There wasn t room  I couldn t fit a golf bag in it without it stick up  My wife couldn t fit the playpen  folded  in it  The large stroller we own for our child wouldn t fit  We usually had to put some of our groceries on the floor of the car because all of it wouldn t fit in the small back space  Also  we had problems shutting the hatch back  Sometimes it didn t want to shut  Sometimes when I hit a dip in the road  the thing actually popped open  I was less than pleased Reason number two to hate this car is the lack of power it has  While test driving it on surface streets you won t notice it  It handles surface streets great  It s when you get on a highway or freeway that you notice  You can put your foot to the floor trying to merge with traffic going over fifty miles and hour and still not reach that speed at a decent pace  I ve almost been in accidents because of this  The car just has no get up and go  Reason number three to hate this car is the wheel is hard to turn when you are doing U turns yet the brakes are super touchy  You can barely put some weight on the brakes and they tend to almost lock up  This you can adjust to  which I did  but I wasn t real happy about it  The steering I also got used to but my wife refused to drive my car after a few times  She felt it was too hard to steer  While some might think the wife not wanting to drive their car is a reason to buy it  remember reason one and two Reason number four to hate this car is that when you travel any distance in it  the car seems to shrink on you  While you might frown about this because we all know cars don t really shrink  I know that  it feels like it is  After an hour or so on the road you realize just how much of a compact car this is  The seats aren t real comfortable after an hour behind the wheel either  It doesn t bother you at first but after an hour  you start to feel it in your back and behind side  Reason number five to hate this car is while traveling you really notice the flaws about this car  While driving in the mountains you are going to experience power loss on the way up  Traffic will start passing you by even though you have your foot to the floor  There just isn t any power in this baby  While driving in the desert I noticed that the car doesn t do well in extreme heat either  You buy newer cars so you don t have to worry about them breaking down  I was worried in this car  Reason number six to hate this car is that since I bought it I ve had to take it into the shop four times  I had to take it in the first time because the brakes needed work and they were new when I bought it  They lasted less than a year  I was told that they see Aspires in often for this  The second reason I had to take it in was it was overheating  The third time I had to take it in was because while driving on the freeway I could hear a bad noise coming from the wheel well on the passenger side  I had to replace the front axal  It was cheaper than paying for a new joint and boot  which was the problem  The fourth time I had to take it in was because there was something wrong with the transmission  I could feel it slipping  Reason number seven to hate this car was paying the huge bill that came with all four of those repair bills Reason number seven to hate this car  and I blame this one one the dealership I bought it from  was the alarm that came with it  It was a cheap alarm system  It was the kind that locks the ignition so no one can drive away with it if they break into it  The alarm was a real piece of junk  Someone could smash a window  steal everything in the car  and it wouldn t set the alarm off  One day my battery for my remote died and I could get into the car but I couldn t get it started  The alarm didn t even go off when I tried to start it  The system worked fine that way  The car wouldn t start  I had to call AAA thinking I d just have it towed home  borrow the wife s alarm remote  and go replace the battery in mine  When AAA showed up the guy just shook his head at me  popped open a panel under the dash  and pushed a button  The alarm shut off so the car started again  All anyone ever had to do was break a window  pop that panel to push a little button  rip out the ignition  and take off with my car in less than a minute  I was a bit furious over this fact Reason number eight to hate this car is that it only comes with two seat belts in the back seat  There is room for a third one but Ford must have really wanted to cut corners when they made it  There is about fourteen inches of space in the middle of the backseat that is totally a waste of space in that regard  Would it have killed them to put in a middle seat belt  I guess so  They sure didn t do it  Reason number nine is the total lack of comfort the car has and functions  Mine was one of the better models made  I had air conditioning  It didn t work very well  The ashtray fell out or jammed up when I tried to use it for a change tray  The glove box is an actual glove box  That s about all that you can fit into the tiny thing  A pair of gloves  I wanted to upgrade the stereo system but realized that again they had really made this car compact  I had a hard time finding a unit that would fit in the very small space provided  When I did try to buy one and have it installed  the people just shook their heads at me and explained that they would have to do a lot of work to remove the factory installed unit and get a new system in  This adds to your normal bill  They assured me that the wiring was a nightmare as well  Reason number ten is looking back at the other nine reasons and knowing that I paid too much money for this car  regretting buying it in the first place  and having to go out to find another car  I no longer have the Aspire  I couldn t wait to be rid of it after having it for just over a year  I also want to mention that the trade in value of the car is painful  It sure hurt me realizing exactly how much having that piece of junk for a year had cost me after they deducted what I d paid on it to that point  deducting the trade in value  and adding that remaining balance to my replacement car  It was a costly mistake that I made buying it  I don t recommend this car to anyone unless you feel like buying a car for someone you don t like who you feel needs one headache after another and a sore backside after a long road trip  Maybe I should have given it to my Mother In Law  LOL  Just kidding  I can t think of anyone that I don t like enough to wish that car on  I have always loved Fords  I bought another Ford  It s just that Ford made a mistake in producing the Aspire  It s the Pinto of the 90 s     
Neg, Although my 1996 automatic Aspire runs well  has decent pickup for a smaller car  and gets great gas mileage  I have been unfortunate to have had to replace the transmission 2 times and the transmission just went out again  so will be a 3rd time  The first time  at 32k  Ford honored the warranty  but the second time  even though it only had 22k on the transmission  there was 54k on the engine  so would not honor the original rebuilt or the extended warranty purchased with the car  As the transmission was rebuilt by a third party this last time  they are going to honor their work and cover the transmission  but if left up to Ford  I would have to pay again  so this economy car is costing more than that 
Neg, I had purchased a 1997 contour sport new from a Dealership expecting it to be a good trouble free family car  The day after I bought it  I had found the spare wheel and jack missing  The Dealership had taken one out of another contour  A few months later  when the rain started coming down  I found that I had two inches of rain in the trunk  I took to the dealership and a week later in the shop they had fixed the leaks  About a month later the brakes started squeaking when backing up  it was loud  They had told me the parking brake cables were sticking and had worn out the rear break pads  So they had replaced the cables  replaced the brake pads and machined the rotors due to wear  The noise had stopped and the car ran good until the check engine light came on  I took it back to the dealership and they hooked it up to the diagnostic and found all kinds of problems with it  So they put me in a rental car until they can get the parts they needed to fix it  The car was under warranty so nothing came out of my pocket and the people were nice  About twenty miles over my warranty my coolant light came on  I checked the coolant and it was at its normal level  I called the dealership and told them the problem and they said it was probably a faulty switch and the warranty had expired  I told them all the troubles I had with it  but they didn t seem to care  A week later my brakes did the same thing when I had bought it new  I called the dealership and told them the problem had not been fixed since this was the same thing that happened the first time  All they could tell me is its out of warranty and your going to have to pay for the parts and labor  That s when I blew up and told them all the problems I had with this NEW car  they didn t seem to care so I hung up and went to the dealership and wasted my time arguing about it  I left with the problem still needing attention  About a month later I had another problem with the car  The car wouldn t come out of park until you messed with it for about ten minutes  I called the dealership and asked for the service manager and told him what I was experiencing now  I didn t get anywhere with him  I finally had it and put the car up for sale and will NEVER buy another ford br br  
Neg, Last year  my wife needed a newer car than the  85 Buick she was driving  I had read reviews and information about the Contour touting it as a pretty good all around car  I was worried about crash worthiness though  If I remember correctly  the Contour doesn t usually score well in all areas of crash protection  When I factored in all the considerations I decided to stick with the Contour nonetheless  I do still  quot like quot  the car  The biggest reasons are the comfort of the car in general  the mid range size of the car that wasn t easy to find in other models  the seats  the fuel economy  and the way it looks  If only  quot looks quot  were everything  The worst of the bad news about this car is that although it is only going on 4 years old it feels like it s going on 10 years old  It hasn t quite gone over 80 000 miles yet but you d think it had gone way past  Further  we have just started experimenting with putting a car seat in the back for our baby and it doesn t look like it s going to be a good fit  Also  if you need the rear seatback to fold down  at least on this non sport model  you can t  I agree with any of the professional consumer mags out there that say body integrity is poor  Also  mechanically for the most part  we don t have much confidence  If you own one of these and you haven t had trouble with the brakes yet you are very lucky  Ours needs 4 new rotors because it vibrates or shimmies when it comes to a stop most of the time  The car has been driven on the highway most of it s life and it already feels like it could use a whole new suspension under some circumstances  The engine is noisy in most situations other than cruising at a steady speed and the car could use a little more power  The car often stalls out after it s first started  Thank goodness I can t think of much to say about the transmission although it s nothing to rave about  Looking back on it  although we certainly could have done worse than we did  we wish we hadn t been so patriotic  If we had bought a Honda  Subaru  Toyota  or Nissan even if it would have had a few more miles on it  I would probably be writing a more positive review now     
Neg, I originally bought my 1997 with 25 000 miles Contour because it looked real nice  and it was very comfortable  About a year or so later I started getting noises from the dash  center console and some near the rear window  I have always loved Ford and have always bought exclusively from them but  this car has irritated me with it s creaks and clicks  After having it for over a year I am trying to trade it in  but the lots are starting to get an inventory of the  97 and earlier  Driving the car  I must admit is very fun  the handling is superb and with only a 4 cylinder engine it is pretty quick  Everything is real responsive  I am not sure about the later models but this one is a curse to all who hate noises as they drive  But if you can get a quite one then you will love to drive this car everywhere     
Neg, Bought a 1997 Contour Sport V6 5 speed with 58 000 miles on the odometer in 2000  Thought I got a good deal  I was wrong This car came completely loaded   power everything  leather interior  fog lights  etc  Unfortunately  this car proved to be about as reliable as your average Yugo  I had this car for all of 25 000 miles  yet I had to replace the water pump twice  the fuel pump  the rear main seal on the engine  a  1 000 repair  and I sold it when it needed an  1800 emissions system repair  This car only had 83 000 miles on it when I got rid of it  yet the resale value was terrible  and just about everything on the car had failed  My opinion of this car is that it is a complete piece of junk  Avoid at all costs   spend some extra money and buy a Honda or Toyota  The Contour V6 is fun to drive when it runs properly  but is it not nearly as quick as advertised  the 170 hp V6 seems pretty weak The manual transmission is very slow  and the low end torque is minimal  This car may seem like a bargain when you first look at it  but look a little deeper  Mine needed  1800 in emissions system repairs when I traded it in   and this was at 83 000 miles  Do you think a Honda or Toyota would require repairs like this at 83 000 miles  Found On Road Dead is not such a bad acronym  
Neg, This is probably a dangerous time to write a review since my check engine light just came on again  but I have finally been provoked to dole out some public disdain for the current sedan offerings from Ford  especially after a recent spike in expensive repairs on my Torridor Red Ford Contour GL  As with many people  I found the contour to be a good handling  fun to drive car  and it came at a price too good to pass up  about  12 800 with everything a college student could use  Power mirrors  door locks  A C  an interesting but chintzy cup holder  all for the aforementioned low price  I purchased the Contour to complement the 1967 Mustang that I had inherited from my father thinking that it would reliably serve my needs as I commuted to College and began working after graduation  Little did I anticipate that my 67  Mustang would be of so much use to me over the next five years as my only working car not scheduled for maintenance  I have about 102 000 miles on my Contour  and only keep it because I have finally set up the suspension and wheels tires just right to out corner unsuspecting BMW drivers on the 110 freeway in Los Angeles  There is no cheaper car on the road that can handle corners better than my Contour  and that helps keep my wallet open and me under the car or visiting my dealer  But sometimes love just isn t enough  especially when it is so confined to the cornering ability of my modified car  The brakes are disc drum and fade at the hint of being used for spirited driving  which isn t too much of a concern unless going down hill  because they usually cool off by the time the under powered engine can get the car to the next corner that requires braking  I am out accelerated by everything  The four cylinder engine needs a lighter car to pull around than it s assigned  mid sized  Contour chassis  The SVT would have better suited me  but it was too much money for my budget and still carried over the same cheap looking interior  In search of some performance  I have tried an open element air filter and Flowmaster exhaust  which did help a little  but were too loud for me as I reached my mid twenties  Searching for a quieter upgrade  I use tires that are a little bit smaller than stock to keep the revs slightly higher  I contest that the real nightmare for Contour owners is not the interior plastics quality that is more of an annoyance and embarrassment  or the adherence to the standard Ford recipe for another overweight under powered car to add to their lineup of tubby cars and RV like SUV 146s  but the real threat is the consistent lighting of the check engine light along with other various failures that I didn t expect before 100 000 miles  The light is annoying in its frequency of attack  and it has been reset two dozen times already as technicians have tried to fix re occurring problems by replacing one part at a time  To make matters worse  it comes on and then goes out leaving me wondering if it just burned out from over use  Technicians cannot use the computer to pinpoint the problem when the light is out because it was told to me that the error code stored in the computer goes away unless the light has been on very recently  The short list of unscheduled maintenance and expensive repairs is as follows  Manual transmission failed and was replaced with the clutch  catalytic converter failed and blocked exhaust  oxygen sensor wire became loose and prompted hundreds of dollars in unnecessary repair before it was found  rear window rain seal has been replaced five times and keeps coming off  both front wheel bearings have been worn out and replaced  windshield cracked when car was washed in the sun  Other annoyances include the many recalls on this vehicle  the creaks and vibrations in the dash and rear side door  lack of rear legroom in such a large car  This is the last Ford that I will buy because I have read too many stories reporting that these problems are not isolated to the Contour line and because I dislike the feeling that I have put too much money into performance products for a car that will just fall apart in the next few years  I think that most of my problems occurred just after the 60 000 mile warranty had expired  just as Ford marketing had planned the Contour to be removed from the US  The Contour will never be a proper sports sedan as the ad campaign had suggested it would be  and I only wished that I had realized this many years ago and sold it while it was worth  5000  I hope that pesky check engine light won t cost too much to get fixed this time  
Neg, How many recalls can a car possibly have in 3 years time  We purchased a 97 Contour for use as a family car  liking the fact that is was a fairly affordable buy  However  from the very start we ve had problems with our vehicle  Upon taking it off of the lot  we had the check engine light on  the salesman informed us that it was a common occurrence if the gas cap isn t put on tightly and that it needed to go into the shop to have the switch reset  In 3 years time  we ve had at least 5 recalls sent to us from Ford  The excitement of having a new car wore off quickly when we noticed imperfections in the design and quality of the vehicle  Almost immediately our clock light burned out  The cupholder  a single one  mind you  was broken after pulling a purse off of the passenger seat  The carpeting on the floor was fitted poorly and hangs out from the plastic molding on the edges  There is no excitement whatsoever to driving this car  It looks like a clone to many other models out there that have no major design features to make it stand out in the crowd  Save your money and shop around for a better buy  you ll be thankful you did br br  
Neg, What I said then  I have always liked the looks of the Ford Contour  but I never seriously considered buying one When my wife and I decided to cut expenses  it was clear that the easiest way to do that would be to unload my beloved Ford Focus ZX3  check out my Focus reviews  After much wailing and gnashing of teeth  I set about looking at used sedans in the  8000 and under range I drove them all  Corsicas  Neons  Cavaliers  even an ancient Camry  Then I ran across a black   97 Contour GL with 67 000 miles at the local ford dealer s used lot  It had the best ride and  except for the 3 1L Corsicas  the most get up and go  The Contour is also the least boring to look at of any car on the list I had the car in the dealer s service department the first three days I owned it  Minor glitches that the dealer took care of at no charge for me  They replaced the rear suspension links  which were making a horrible thunking noise over bumps  the belt and idler pulley  and adjusted the driver s door to eliminate a bit of leakage around the seal  Since then  the car has been smooth running and trouble free Some of the interior bits are a little loose  but no more than I expect in a pre Focus Ford car  All of the options and gadgets work perfectly  The highway ride is glassy smooth and quiet  and power is typical of the Zetec engine If you keep it spinning in the mid range  3000 4500 rpm  the Contour is capable of surprisingly urgent acceleration On the downside  my Contour has a good deal of play in the drivetrain which makes smooth corner exits difficult  and standing starts take a bit of concentration to avoid chattering the too grabby clutch  I don t know if this is a typical Contour problem My biggest gripe with the interior is the retractable cupholder in the center console  It s flimsy and too small for anything but a soda can  Also  it s too close to the shifter and parking brake  I tugged the brake handle up with the cupholder open and lost some skin off of my knuckles In spite of my disappointment over giving up my Focus  the Contour has become an agreeable driving companion and I believe it will keep me happy until our finances stabilize and Ford brings the Focus ZX5 to the States Update January 2002  What I say now  The Contour started giving me trouble last August and hasn t stopped  Out of the blue  the engine began to die at random intervals while driving  No warning of any kind  it simply shut off  The dealer had the car for the better part of a month and couldn t figure it out  After a while  they just gave up and I have had to live with it Then the airbag light started flashing intermittently  So I traded the thing in on a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer  I m much happier now Review on the Lancer coming soon  
Neg, I bought this car because it was Saturday and I needed to get to work on Monday  My other car died and I was in a jam  My wife and I knew this car salesman  so we told him to keep an eye out for us  We couldn t afford anything over  5000 at the time  so when my buddy called about the 91 Thunderbird  I jumped at the offer  We ended up paying about  4000  and the shirts off our backs Let me start by stating that I purchased this car with 97 000 miles on it and it currently has 145 000 miles  I will reveal how this car has held up after 9 years and 1145 000 miles  and what I have done to it within my first 50 000 miles This car is fun to drive  There is something about owning a T Bird with the 5 0 V8 engine  This car has everything power windows  locks  mirrors  driver s seat  rear defrost  keyless entry and alloy wheels  This car is fast too  I m sure there are some 4 cylinders that can beat it off the line  but let s see who s first to 100 mph  turbos need not apply The handling is a joke  This car likes to roll into turns no matter how slow you go  It sort of wobbles when I turn  It s not visible wobble  but it feels like it moves from side to side while turning  This got better after I purchased new tires for it  but it s starting to happen again with only about 30 000 miles on the new tires  Apparently  this car only likes brand new tires  Make no mistake  this car is not a sports car  Sure  it has a 205 hp V8  but the car is just to heavy and long  It bounces over bumps  and you ll feel every one  The steering wheel likes to shimmy too  Again  this may fix itself when I replace the tires At first  the car s finish has held up very well  There is little rust to speak of  The only visible rust is due to a bent corner on the driver s door  I m not sure how the guy before me bent that  There is also some rust along the bottom of the doors  This is only visible if the doors are open and you actually look at the underside of the doors  There are a few specks of peeling paint on the black trim on the front bumper  The trunk lines don t seem to fit together evenly  but I suspect the guy before me was in a slight accident  Now  the clearcoat is beginning to peel on the roof  After 150 000 miles though  you can t be too surprised The interior has held up very well too except the front seats  There are no cracks or blemishes in the entire dash board and there is no fading either  The only part of the interior that shows any sign of wear are the seats  which are very worn and uncomfortable  The rear arm rests are bulging out of their notches too  and the release levers on the front seats are busted  You can move the seats forward without using the levers  That s not a big deal though Speaking of broken  the rear defrost took that path around 100 000 miles  The fluid monitoring system is gone too  I think the transmission missed the rear defrost  because it went around the same time  It took with it 3 02 sensors  some belts and hoses  the water pump  the power steering assembly  a turn signal assembly and some fuel lines  The mechanic actually said there had been a fume fire on my gas tank  I think I might have bent over on that one  but who knows  I think my tires are getting lonely  I will have to replace them in a few weeks  The passenger automatic seat belt is possessed  I just try not to upset it I have spent about  6000 in repairs from August 1999  to May of 2003  It has been trouble free for the past few months  knock  knock  At least the dealership where I bought it from agreed to pay for half of my new transmission  which I had repaired elsewhere  That s a Toyota dealership for you The speedometer only goes to 85 mph  That s pretty wimpy for a V8  I ve had the thing burried way past 85  The radio rots  I m not sure if it s just old  or if radios weren t that good 10 years ago  There is an absolute lack of bass  My voice can go lower than these 6x9s  I just put in a Kenwood CD player and some Polk speakers  Even these entry level items are a vast improvement I may be crazy  but I love my T Bird  Despite it s shortcomings  there s just something about driving a V8 T Bird  I will definitely miss this car when it s time to trade it in for a familymobile I would recommend this car as a first car for people in high school because it is a cheap car to buy  the resale value is horrible  but the V8 would get them into trouble and the V6 is laughable  It would make a good car for a single person or a couple who isn t ready  smart enough  to purchase a Camry UPDATE  07 31 00 The new tires solved the wobbly turns and the shimmying steering wheel  This car handles much better now  so forget those negative comments I made about the handling  This car does handle more like a sports car now than it did  It is still a little off balanced as far as weight distribution  but the handling has improved  Check out my review of the Firestone Firehawk tires UPDATE  09 09 00 Well  the starter went out so I had to replace that  116 000 mile isn t too bad for something like that  That brings the grand total for the repair bill to about  4500 since I bought this car in August of 99  I m not liking this car so much UPDATE  01 03 00 Well  some clamp came loose on the radiator which caused some antifreeze to spill out  Not too bad  only  30 UPDATE  06 03 01 The airconditioner needed to be recharged  Figures  Another  80 down the drain   120 000 miles UPDATE  01 30 02 The O2 sensors needed to be replaced again  This is the third time in 30 000 miles UPDATE  06 11 02 I put in another 2 grand into this thing  I replaced the shocks  oil pan  and a bunch of brake junk  I had to recharge the A C again  which is becoming an annual event  The Check Engine light comes on for no reason I must say  the car rides so much better now that I have replaced the shocks  I also had to replace the tire rods and a buch of crap related to that  The car s more quiet now and rides much stiffer  It s nice  Still  make sure you don t buy one of these things with 100k miles on it UPDATE  05 12 03 I have edited some of the content  
Neg, An American legend After rented a 4 door Mazda for one week  I was ready for something more powerful to drive around rough highways in the Los Angeles area during my business trip  What did I rent  A 2 door 2001 Ford Mustang which came with standard options such as dual airbags  cruise control  power windows  CD player and A C  In addition to those standard items  the car had a traction control  This I was impressed to find the traction control  which definitely helps to reduce the chance of losing control of the vehicle under bad weather conditions Performance Basically  there are two different models for 2001 Mustang  The normal Mustang comes with a 3 8 liter V 6 engine with 196hp  The GT models come with a 4 6 liter V 6 engine with 260 hp  Because I only drove a non GT  I am sure that GT performs totally different from my review  As soon as I stepped on the pedal  I knew that I chose the right vehicle to drive around the highways of the LA area  I could not compare the way the car accelerated with a 4 cylinder sedan  Despite the fact that the car accelerated very fast  the noise from the engine was not annoying at all  I no longer felt scared when I was merging onto a freeway   People were flying on a merging lane  As a trade off to the fast acceleration  the fuel efficiency of the car was not so good  Based on my rough estimate  the car drove about 25 miles per gallon  However  this is not so bad for a V 6 with 196hp  Comfort The driver s side seat was quite comfortable  However  the suspension system of the car seemed to be not working as nicely as a regular sedan  like a Toyota Camry  Basically  the suspension system does not absorb shocks very well  However  this seems to be a quite common symptom for a sports car  The inside space of the car as well as the trunk space seem to be larger than earlier models  This is definitely a big improvement from 80 s Mustangs  Design Compared to Mustang s long time competitors like Camaros and Firebirds  Mustang definitely made a great improvement of its design and image  While keeping its identity as a traditional American sports car  the current Mustang body was designed based on the first generation Mustang  this car looks classier than ever  I guess I am not a big fan of those bad boy looking cars like Firebirds and Camaros   Believe it or not  Marketers for those cars target those people who are attracted to a bad boys image Overall  I really enjoyed driving this car on the highways in the Los Angeles area  With this powerful 3 6 liter V 6 196 hp engine  this car definitely drives very well on those rough highways br br  
Neg, I recently got to test drive a 2001 Ford Mustang with my friend who is going to buy it  The particular car we drove was a V6 manual transmission convertible  I ll say it right now   the car looks really cool  I felt like a millionaire driving it  Bright yellow with a black convertible top  and a black leather interior  It s definitely a fun car  but only on the outside On the inside  you re treated to horribly uncomfortable font bucket seats  and an even worse rear seat  Even though everything was covered in soft leather  the seats were hard and unforgiving  I can stay put in my 1991 CRX for 6 hours without a single problem  but my back hurt after half an hour of driving this beast  Not only that  but the legroom was awful  I can completely stretch my legs out in my CRX  I m 6 1  but in the Mustang my knees hit the dash with the seat scooted all the way back  What gives  I realise it s a sports car  but how hard would it have been to give you a couple extra inches of legroom  I won t even talk about the rear seat  it s more of a storage space for your stuff that won t fit in the tiny trunk than a place for people to sit Next up  performance  For a car that looks so pretty  you d expect it to have the innards to back up it s racey look  Not so my friend  I actually street raced someone  I know  not smart  who was driving a Miata  I could see they had a five speed too  but here s the thing  Miatas are rated at I believe 135hp   they re also a 4 cylinder  while the V6 Mustang is rated at 160hp  The Miata won  and I was disappointed by the lack of performance in this beautiful car I was driving  It was like driving my mom s Civic  except extremely uncomfortable  and with poor handling That reminds me  the handling  I m used to my little CRX  which can stop on a dime  and with the right tires make 90 degree turns are 30mph  The Mustang seemed to hesitate when making evasive maneuvers  The car is pretty heavy too  which made it feel more like a truck than a sporty coupe Needless to say  I can not recommend this car  It s too unrefined for my tastes  and lacks the amount of power you d expect from a legend  My friend bought it anyway  and that s great for him  But I ll stick with my CRX  thank you very much  
Neg,  S ince late 1985 when the Ford Taurus first was shown at autoshows around the world  it was almost an instant hit  people loved this aerodynamic  concept looking  car with no front grille  Finally  in 1986 the Ford Taurus went on sale  along with its sister car  the  Mercury Sable i Driving Impressions i  My tester  1990 Ford Taurus   unlike the 1987 models came with a more powerful 3 8 liter V6 as an option  Actual horsepower specs are the same between the 3 0 OHV Vulcan and the OHV Essex V6  but unlike the Vulcan it reaches its 140 horsepower at a much lower RPM  and instead of 160 lb ft of torque it has a more impressive 215 lb ft  The 3 8 is fuled by multi port fuel injection and is a pushrod design  This engine is found in a multitude of Ford  Mercury  and Lincoln automobiles  first seen in the Ford Thunderbird as a base engine  The 1990 Ford Taurus still has the same AXOD 4 speed automatic transmission  but since 1989 it has larger fluid lines so ATF can lubricate vital parts more efficiently  You will notice that the 3 8 compared to the OHV 3 0 models that acceleration from the light is much quicker  hills are a snap  and cruising is hushed  At 70 MPH the 1990 Ford Taurus 3 8 is cruising at an aprrox 2 100 RPM  With the 3 0 it was a higher 2 800 RPM  For 1990  4 engines are available   the base engine is a 2 5 liter that produces 90 horsepower  This may not seem like a lot  in fact it s not  but it does not do too bad of a job moving this car around  the 2 5 4 cylinder was dropped in 1992  There is the Vulcan V6 3 0 liter which produced 140 horsepower  found in all models  and the 3 8 which is found in the GL and LX models  There is also  since 1989  a new engine by Yamaha  which is a 3 0 liter DOHC V6 engine that produces an impressive 220 horsepower and 200 lb ft of torque  this engine unfortunately can only be found in the expensive SHO  super high output  models i Interior Innovation i  The  interior  of the 1990 Ford Taurus is almost all new for this year  The dash is totally changed from its predecessor  and is much easier on the eyes than it once was  Ergonomics are very simple and easy to use  The LX model I drove had power everything  including leather power seats  with power lumbar support  6 speaker premium Ford sound system which sounded excellent for a stock system of this time period  and manual keyless entry  One of my major gripes with the 1990 Ford Taurus s interior is the lack of bucket seats  Instead Ford uses a split bench front which aids in more seating  however results in lower levels of support vs a bucket seat design   Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior  looks almost exactly like it did back in 1986  very little exterior changes have occurred since introduction  The paint has improved over the 4 years  and the rear tail lights look more modern  Back in 1990 this car was still ahead of its time  GM still had its boxy Buick Century  and other boxy family cars  but they were starting to get the hint that Ford had something going with this whole aerodynamic theme  In fact this style was so adored  in 1990 the Ford Taurus was the best selling car in America i Pricing Reliability i  These cars go for very cheap today  the Ford Taurus has terrible resale value  But for those who need a car  but don t have a lot of money  this is good news  This car can be found for around  2 000  The only problem is  is that the 1990 Ford Taurus has a reputation for being a lemon  I personally have never owned a 1990 ford Taurus  but I did own a Mercury Sable for over a year with the same powertrain  and it had loads of problems  including  transmission bands breaking   lots of money to fix  starter problems  alternator  fuel pump  power steering pump   lines  new struts  wheel bearings  and a few other things  The headliners on these cars are awful  Since this is almost 2003 most of these headliners are already ripped  you most likely will be hard pressed finding a  90 Taurus with a mint condition interior i Final Thoughts i I do not recommend the 1990 Ford Taurus  however if this car is a  must  on your car shopping list  I can t stress enough how important it is that you take it to a professional mechanic  These cars have been known to cause their owners a great deal of misery   Other Cars To Consider i 1  Honda Accord b 2  Chevy Lumina  a href content 63653777028 http www epinions com content 63653777028 a   My Review b 3  Toyota Camry 4  Buick Le Sabre 5  Dodge Dynasty 6  Plymouth Acclaim 7  Chevy Corsica 8  Chevy Beretta 9  Nissan Maxima 10  Nissan Stanza Happy Car Shopping  
Neg, My parents bought the 1990 Taurus L brand new in August 1990  I thought it was only the second car they ever bought that wasn t dorky looking  the other being a 1981 Monte Carlo  It was white with a black interior  which proved to be very hot in the summer time  They gave me the car as a college graduation present in May 1996 with 42 000 miles on it  I drove it to 148 000 miles somehow  I ll start by saying what I liked  Styling  The taurus was a great looking car  about the right size to carry 4 5 people  comfortable seats  very legible gauges  good acceleration with the 3 0 V6  great handling  good cargo room in the trunk  I also liked the air conditioner which was much stronger than other Fords I ve driven when it worked  I liked the fake wood strip on the dashboard it looked like wood not plastic  The stereo speakers sounded good until I put a 50 watt per channel JVC in there and it blew them up in a few days  I also liked the big mirrors on the Taurus  Now for the bad  And there was a lot of bad  The car went through two transmissions  each costing  1800  The ignition module failed 4 or 5 times  The fuel injection had to be replaced at 69 000 miles  I went through so many power steering pumps I forgot to keep track  i m guessing five or more  The five Alternators lasted maybe 30 000 miles  water pumps lasted 40 000  went through 4 of those too  I got really darned good at replacing things under the hood  THe factory radiator was plastic and it cracked through at 70 000 miles  The transmission s  always shifted hard and abrupt with a lot of gear whine  The CV boots were always disentigrating  The Ford brake pads were good for maybe 25 000 miles a set  front rotors lasted twice that  rear drums went only 70 000 miles and this was with nothing but highway driving  The seats were threadbare before 100 000 miles  The windows  doors  and windshields leaked so badly that I eventually had to rip out the carpeting and padding and throw it all away due to mold  That revealed serious disfiguring rust in the unibody and floorboards  The trunk had a basketball sized hole in it from rust  The windshield would drip on my feet it rusted the brake pedal  Electrical problem that was never solved began around 90k entire electrical system would go dead except the battery  which was fully charged  It would sit for days and then BAM  It would decide to start    The ignition switch wore out every 40 000 miles  Eventually the locking mechanism kept jamming so I took a crowbar and just broke the darned thing and started the car by just pulling up on the little rod inside the steering column  Everyone thought it was a stolen car because of that no  just poor Ford quality   The turn signal stalk broke off and the one I got at the junkyard broke off too  The cruise control worked sometimes  The PRNDL gear indicator was way off so it looked like it was in reverse when it was really in drive  The headliner fell out  the door panels fell off  the struts on the hood gave out so I had to prop it open with a 2x4 to work on it  The suspension was forever out of alignment The dealer service WHAT dealer service  The Ford dealers in Louisville  KY are these giant conglomerate corporations that care about money not customer service  I learned to just go buy the parts and do the work myself as they either didn t have mechanics who were competent or they just rolled their eyes when yet  another  problem Taurus came in for repairs  By the time I scraped together the cash to buy a new vehicle  the engine was just about shot and the cylinder compression was gone in two cylinders  plus the oil pump was gone and the valvetrain was tapping badly  sounded like an old Chrysler Slant Six if ya know what I mean   The Taurus left me stranded so many times I almost got fired from my job for being late or no show so much  The boss just couldn t believe there was a car this unreliable but it was true   So finally in April 1998 I bought a new GMC Sonoma  That s a total POS too read my review on that lemon here on Epinions  I got  1000 for the Taurus on a trade in  and still owed  3800 on it for repairs  It took me 2 years to pay off on a car I didn t even own anymore  NO MORE American made junk for me  My next car will come from Germany or Japan  end of comment  
Neg, My mom had a 1986 Ford Taurus  I belive it was the first year of of cars  We were lucky to get the worst car ever  a 4 cyl  taurus  So depressing  My mom bought this car in 1994 after her last car was stolen  Ohhh i remember going with her to pick it up  It looked nice in the garage it was in  really it did  My mom started it and we were on our way  It felt like we were riding in an enclosed lawnmower  That is what it felt and sounded like  The way it sounded was the very least that was wrong with the car  In time the drivers side window became a problem  It was fine to open  but when it came time to close  the window went out instead of up  real nice for protection huh  The car wasnt very mechanically well built either  I was lucky enough to be driving the car when its transmission droppd dead  Thats right folks  pouring rain  up a hill  in the worst area of NYC and lots of traffic  I wasnt too happy  and niether was the 20 cars behind me  Someone did help me push the car though  So after the transmission was fixed it worked  sort of  A few monthes later the car went on fire  now that i think about it   it was taken to the mechanic at least once a week because the engine was smoking  severly overheating  Did i metion we kept water in the car incase the car went on fire  Oh yea  another thing  the hood couldnt stay up by itself  he held it open with a hockey stick  oh yea and another thing about opening the hood  well the thing u pulled back on to make the hood release broke off  so we had to pull the wires with a vice grip  The windsheild washer pump never worked  and winshield wipers didnt work either  OK OK  and the rear bumber was falling off since the day we got the car  Needless to say the tranmission died again  and my mom gave to car away  All these things happned within 7500miles of eachother when we got the car it had 49 000 miles  piece of junk no br br  
Neg, I had a 90 Ford Taurus wagon which I just got rid of  The reason  it cost more to repair the car than it was actually worth  So  we donated it to a local school  and the car s problems will be fixed  and it will be washed and waxed and hopefully whoever gets the car will be very grateful  After all  it was one of those  quot low mileage cream puffs quot  It only had 28 500  The first seven years were totally trouble free  but in late 96 early 97 it began to develop problems  The digital speedometer  always a mistake  and automatic climate control began to fail  There was some leak in the line to the speedometer  causing it to suddenly register  quot 0 quot  while driving down a highway  And the climate control system would blow either too little or too much air it was basically as uncooperative as possible  That Spring  the transmission began to have problems  It was mainly having problems going from first and second gear  but it got so that we had to manually shift the car from first to second  So  we took it into the shop  and they claimed to fix the transmission  but of course  it was a Ford dealership  and they basically lied to us  They temporarily fixed the climate control  but it broke again  Things were OK until December of 98  when the drivers side power seat simply failed  I was never too confident in the design  especially considering how much stuff is hanging down below that seat  it just doesn t look as well designed as other power seat systems I ve seen  And  finally in May of 1999  a head gasket blew  and a belt snapped  Its been parked on the street every since  while we debated and procrastinated deciding its fate The night it was towed away  I still remember that the interior smelled fresh  the car glistened in the moonlight  and the tow driver was truly amazed we wanted him to tow this  quot new car quot  away  And  on the whole  it was a very good car  The 3 8L V 6 was very peppy  handling was secure for a wagon  and the climate control and trip computer were all somewhat ahead of their time  a bit too much  so it would appear  We also miss the cargo space tremendously  It was a good car  but it simply was not reliable br br  
Neg, My parents bought this car when i was elementary school and I loved it  For a family car  this had enough room to keep my parents from constantly telling my sister and me to stop arguing about space issues in the back seat  But things began to take a turn for the worst about two years after the purchase of the car used  it then being around 2 or 3 years old  About 5 years ago  my family was riding home in it and the air conditioning just went out like that  No warning  just stopped  My family did not have a lot of money to just dish out around 1500 dollars for another air conditioner  and I found out later that this is a problem with many Ford vehicles until the mid 1990 s  So if you do purchase a Ford vehicle before 1994  make sure that the air conditioner is working or is new  because if it isn t new  9 times out of 10  isn t operational  I began driving the car two years ago as a junior in high school  Living in Texas and not having air conditioning is a scary situation and led me to almost pass out on one ride home  But there are other problems with the car I would just like to emphasize My sister has the car now and the last time I talked with my father he said that the transmission is about to go and for a 1990 model  it only has 100 000 miles on it  During the time I drove it  it broke down on me three times  Two of the times it was the water pump busting  The third time it broke down on me  it had something to do with my air conditioner  indirectly  Apparently when your compressor goes  that is what happened to the air conditioning  it is directly linked to the starter in a Ford vehicle  So if you try using something that requires using the compressor  it will stop you car  I did not know this at the time  so during a downpour  I needed to use my defrost because I couldn t see outside of my window  Upon doing this  my car stopped in a busy intersection and I was forced to push my car to the gas station that luckily was right near where my car broke down  I have no idea if this car just hates me  or if it is honestly a bad car  my suggestion  Please avoid 1990 Taurus like a plague  I knew two other people that had a car similar to this one and the air conditioner in their cars broke as well  If you live up north where the high does not reach 110 that frequently  then by all means  this car is probably the car for you  But if you live in a hot area  take your chances on something else br br  
Neg, My Ford Taurus experience began in October of 1999 when I purchased the car for around  2000  I was attending Stonehill College in Easton  MA at the time and needed a vehicle to drive to Quincy  MA where I live  At first the car was reliable and drove fine  but after a few months the problems started Here is a chronological list of the problems I have had over the last 2 and a half years b Jan  2000   regulator broken  The car will not start I have this fixed b Apr  2000   car rattles  Mechanic thinks it is the struts  but I do not need to replace them b June 2000   AC broken  Just in time for the summer  I have this fixed b Feb  2001   Alternator broken  I have this one fixed b Aug  2001   Problems shifting into reverse  The car takes a few seconds to shift into reverse  I m told there is a problem with my brakes  but it is not too critical b Aug Feb  2002   Reversing problem gets worse  Mechanic tells me that my brakes are the problem  New brakes are supposed to fix the problem b Aug  2002    280 brake work  Car still has problem shifting into reverse  Mechanic now tells me that it is my transmission  Estimated price for repair is  1500 That value of my car is only  1000 at best  so repairing it is pointless  I continue to drive the car as of June 13th  2002  but the transmission gets worse every day  Currently the car is at 125 000 miles The thing that was surprising to me about the Taurus is that two of my friends Taurus  died when the transmissions went  One died at around 75 000 miles and the other at 125 000 miles I am no expert when it comes to cars  but from my own personal experiences with the Ford Taurus and that of my friends  I would highly recommend seeking another type of automobile  From my current understanding  the Ford Taurus is not built to last and if you have one  expect the transmission to die Good luck  
Neg, I bought a 1987 Ford Taurus station wagon in 1994 to obtain comfort  and space at a reasonable price  I have now owned it for five years  It looked great on the used car lot  had less than 100 000 and passed the inspection of professional mechanic On the positive side  this car is smooth and comfortable  The seats are nicely padded and wear well  The controls help the driver and passenger determine the positioning and angle of each seat  It gets about 20 MPG  The paint has been durable The problem is the engine  There are weaknesses in the transmission  heating cooling system and power steering  These require thousands of dollars to repair  Most every owner I have spoken to have reported the same weaknesses  Count on rebuilding the transmission at about 100 000 miles  The heater and air conditioner are hard to get to and may cost about  1 500 to repair  The power steering begins to leak at about 125 000 miles  requiring the mechanism and hoses to be replaced  I gave my car regular preventative care  however  these repairs cost me more than I paid for the car  Ouch In summary  buy this model if you can afford the repairs br br  
Neg, The 1990 Ford Taurus offered a comfortable ride for the two years I had it  But its list of problems are long and serious  Starting with the outside  the pain has a terrible habit of rusting at the edges of the doors  While you can sand it off easily and coat it again in paint  the rust simply keeps on coming back  The engine is louder and a poor performer for being a V6  Gas mileage is average at roughly 30  The interior has problems involving squeaky door panels and power locks which break  Idle can turn rough on a cold start  its very apparent when sitting at a stop light  the engine will rev up and down once per second causing the car to rock   a new O2 sensor did not solve this problem  By far the biggest problem with this car is the transmission  When it works  its sloppy  has a late  or no  downshift  and slips  When it doesn t work  you look at a  2100 transmission rebuilding estimate  The transmission shop confirmed that this car has major transmission troubles  My Taurus started losing fluid to the point where pouring fluid back was not sufficient  it leaked out the front seal the second the transmission was set in motion  While the car did its job  moving to and from school once per day  its not dependable  
Neg, I don t like Fords as a matter of practice  You see   I ve had two really crummy experiences with them  My first was a 1997 Taurus  Problems started with that vehicle the first day I drove it home from the dealer and it needed a tow that afternoon  That was one of thirteen tows that vehicle needed in the 55 000 miles I put on the vehicle  and they never found the problem  The second problem is my current vehicle  the 1999 Taurus  which is in the shop as we speak due to a recall and several electrical problems that are being fixed under warranty I know  I know   I m supposed to be talking about a 2000 Ford Windstar  and that s exactly what this review is about  I m renting one  and have had one for the last week A Ford Windstar is a minivan  I must also state that I dislike minivans very much  I think  without being insulting  that they look dorky and they re made for exactly who I m not   a soccer mom The trimline on this Windstar is the SE package  It is your basic package  not a whole lot of bells and whistles are included  but it does have some nice creature comforts  The one thing I have never been able to complain about with Ford products is that they do make a rather comfortable vehicle This vehicle comes with a six cylinder 3 8 liter engine that produces 200 horsepower at 4900 rpm and 240 foot pounds of torque at 3600 rpm  It will climb hills  especially when you shut off the overdrive  By hills  I mean the Rocky Mountains of Colorado  which is where I live  It is advertised to get 18mpg in the city and 22mpg on the highway  Because I do a lot of mountain driving  I got far less gas mileage than what was advertised The transmission shifts gears smoothly  without any real jarring  In fact  I would say the transmission is as smooth as my Taurus  It is a comfortable shift of gears that is barely noticeable unless you floor the accelerator  This leads to a very smooth ride inside the van There is no flashy trim with this vehicle that would distinguish itself from any other minivan  although it does have a factory roof rack and molded bumpers  That s the extent of the fanciness outside Inside  it comes with two benches in the rear that not only fold down  but slide out of the vehicle totally  turning it from a passenger van into a cargo van  It does have an 1800 pound payload capacity  and you can fit furniture inside the cargo area with the seats removed It also has front and rear climate controls  which was a neat idea  The front passengers can control the temperature for the front of the vehicle  and the rear passengers can control the temperature back there  This is neat for children who sometimes complain that they are too hot or too cold This vehicle is also equipped with an AM FM cassette stereo  While the controls are simple to figure out  the sound is rather poor  I m not sure if that s something unique to the Ford Windstar or if that s something that s common in minivans  Either way  even hearing talk radio clearly means some heavy manipulation with the bass and treble controls Another funny thing with the stereo was that when I turn off the engine  the stereo keeps running  I can pull the key out  open the driver s door and close it and the radio still runs  This vehicle is equipped with an accessory delay  which allows you to manipulate the stereo and the windows after you ve already shut off the vehicle As an insurance adjustor  I ve never been a fan of this feature on cars  There are far too many things that can accidentally be done where a car owner can be sorry about later  Windows can inadvertently be opened and I don t trust electrical components   especially Ford electrical components   to work as advertised  Ford has a lousy history with me and their electronics The seats provide  plenty  of room inside  I certainly cannot complain about my six foot frame being cramped  I would say that a seven foot tall driver would run into a headroom problem  but legroom and headroom for me was not an issue On the other hand  the seats aren t comfortable  They are very stiff and thin for bucket seats  There is a plastic armrest that can be lifted and lowered  but it is at an unnatural position when in the lowered position  My arm feels like it is sitting far too high for comfort  I have chosen to keep the armrest up I noticed that the two passengers I took   both women   got in the passenger seat and immediately raised the armrest out of the way  so it isn t just me If you don t wear a seatbelt  the seatbelt indicator will stay lit  One thing I did notice as I was sitting at a drive through window at a McDonalds without my seatbelt on was after about twenty seconds  there is an annoying alarm that comes on telling you to buckle up  As far as I can tell  there s no way to shut up the alarm aside from buckling the seatbelt  This is a good feature for people like my dad  who for some reason refuses to buckle up The passenger bench seats are as comfortable as bench seats can be  They provide little support for the lumbar or the thighs  but then again I ve never been in a vehicle that does  While they do come out of the vehicle  they don t feel rickety and have a rather secure feeling Part of that secure feeling may come from a pain in the backside  literally  to take the seats out  It s supposed to be a simple process   you fold the seat down  tug on a hook on the floor  and the seat is supposed to slide right out  I don t claim to be the most mechanical person in the world  but it took some engineering thoughts on my end before I was successful in removing the seat from the floor The vehicle does come with power windows and power locks  The power windows are rather neat  The front windows go up and down just like in any other car  However  the back windows  pop  in and out  like van windows did  they just do it automatically  As far as I can tell  there is no way to raise or lower the rear panel window in the liftgate The liftgate does open straight up and is a single door in this model  While this is a tall vehicle  people of shorter stature  is that the politically correct term these days  should have little trouble reaching the liftgate in its open position  I have to give Ford credit for this feature There are two sliding passenger doors on this vehicle which makes for a very nice option  While I wasn t hauling around cargo or kids  I could see where this feature was a blessing  especially for cargo  It meant that with the rear seats out  you could slide the doors open and have someone pull from either direction to help load the vehicle  With the sliding doors  you can also park in very tight spaces and still gain access to the vehicle The doors do lead me to one major complaint  When I was growing up  my mother taught me that chivalry was not dead and that you open and close car doors for your women passengers  As I stated before  I had two different female passengers in this van The problem arises from the fact that some idiot at Ford chose to put the only outside key entry to this vehicle in the passenger door  While many vehicles these days have keyless entry  this particular van didn t  This meant I had two choices   I could leave the vehicle unlocked  which I am not a fan of  even if it isn t my car  or I could run over to the driver s side  unlock the door  open it to unlock all the doors and then run back to the other side of the van to open the passenger door Well  here s a newsflash  Ford  That s a lousy idea  You lose major points with me on that  even if most people would find that complaint silly Other features include power mirrors  a SecureLock anti theft system and dual air bags So  what are my recommendations  Well  I d say if you want a comfortable ride in a minivan  then the Ford Windstar is for you  If you want a comfortable minivan  you may want to look elsewhere  I m pretty annoyed with the idea that there s no passenger door entry lock  I don t like the accessory delay feature  and I don t like the strangely placed armrests for the front seats I m going to be generous and give the Windstar three stars out of a possible five  For me  that s a good rating on a Ford  For a vehicle in general  that s a mediocre rating overall br br  
Neg, I rented a vehicle for vacation last week and unfortunately they didn t have much of a selection  so I ended up with a new Ford Windstar  My first impression was  quot what a piece of junk quot  The fit and finish is absolutely horrible  the quality of the materials makes this van basically like a large economy car  Maybe the  30 000  version comes with better material  The stereo was decent  but its radio reception on a scale of 1 to 10 was a negative 40  There s no antenna in sight anywhere  so I m guessing it s just a wire hidden under the windshield or something Believe it or not  my opinion changed when I first drove it  It s a real blast to drive  it has pretty good acceleration and braking  although the unrefined drivetrain feels too much like my large E150 full size van  Since it s built on a car platform  it rides nicely  very low to the ground  and it doesn t feel like you re going to tip over like in most other vans  Fun to drive or not  the materials still kept their cheap quality  and although the steering wheel was kind of nice  when I reversed out of a driveway and tried to shift it into drive  the position of the steering wheel never let me view the dashboard to see what gear I was going into The seats were pretty comfortable  especially for this type of vehicle  The power driver s seat is the best  the passenger s is okay  and the 2 bench seats in the back only hold a total of 4 very small children comfortably  Family van  I guess  but definitely not a van to hold more than two adults Overall  it s an okay van  good for those on a budget  and who don t mind admitting it by buying one of these  The styling is kind of nice  although it s apparent that Ford took a Chevy Venture and added some NewEdge  think Cougar  details  If you re observant  you can easily tell how much the owner paid for each Windstar by the regular or elaborate front grille  The driver side sliding door is 99  useless  and it s even hard to get in by the one on the other side because a large and very annoying seat belt makes rear passengers feel caged in  The only other thing I have to say about it is  Why is this van so radically popular when it is A  Pretty shoddy  and B  A total spinoff of GM s vans  br br  
Neg, Our family recently purchased a new 2000 Ford Windstar SEL and so far I have been very pleased with the purchase  which when you read on you ll understand that this is saying a lot We are a family of 4 with two boys 10 and 6  The wife an I both work outside the home and I drove a 1992 Ford Explorer and the wife drove a 1991 4 door Honda Accord  We love to go camping and we pull a medium size Colemann Pop Up camper when we are able to go  I was starting to have serious problems with the Ford Explorer  and we decided it was time to buy a new tow vehicle  After looking at other manly vehicles  Tahoe  Lincoln Navigators  Suburbans  etc  I just couldn t justify their cost and fuel mileage  Besides the wife typically takes the boys  and their friends  to recreational activities  so she would be driving it as often as I did  After some discussion  and believe me I was not an easy sell  we decided to look into mini vans as an option to replace the Explorer Needless to say  I swallowed my manly pride and we are now owners of a mini van  After looking into many different models we decided on Ford because they were offering 60 months  9  financing at the time on the Windstar and they came packaged with the best options for the price  We purchased an SEL model with leather  CD Cassette  dual A C  back up sensors  and power sliding doors  driver   passenger side  etc After owning this vehicle for 3 months now  we could be happier  yes me too  Gas mileage in town is been running 17 18 MPG  and 23 25 on the highway  It has plenty of power to pull the camper and plenty of room for kids and related sporting equipment  I am very picky about vehicles and this van has impressed me as being very solid and free from defects  I do hear quick and slight drive train grind when initially driving off after the van has been parked for a while  but it only lasts a split second and doesn t re occur until the van is stopped and restarted  The other annomily that I ve heard is the occasional sound of water from the A C dripping on the exhaust when going down the highway Finally  I thought that the power sliding doors was a bit too much when we first purchased the van  but after owning it for a couple weeks I realized just how conveinent that option was  No hands door opening  keeps kids from scratching the doors  ensures that they can get in even on hill sides  and makes it nice for putting groceries in when your hands are full  Oh yea  I now drive a 4 dr Honda Accord to work each day  quite a step from a SUV UPDATE  We had just returned home from a 11 hour road trip only to have the transmission completely fail while trying to take off from a stop light  It gave me no warning of any kind  just a large crunch when trying to accelerate away from a stop light  Get this  The warranty expired less than 60 days earlier and after the road trip the van now has 37K miles on it  Ford has agreed to pick up part of the cost but I m stuck with a  950 repair   Oh  yea a rebuilt transmission could cost anywhere from  2 200 to  2 800  The main problem is that Ford uses the Ford Taurse transmission in these mini vans  These transmissions are alread plagued with problems and when you add the extra 800 lbs of a mini van  it s just asking for trouble  If your debating the different mini vans  look beyond Ford and go with Toyota or better yet Honda  I ll likely trade mine in as soon as it gets back from the dealer  My advise  stay away from Ford products with FWD automatic transmissions  
Neg, I am a soccer mom  And I got this car at a discount  but if I were to do it over again  and I WON this car in a raffle  I d throw the keys away First let me say I ve driven this car for 18 months  so what I write  I write from experience  Some people may find the following complaints nit picky  But  I live in my car  I drive the kids to school  I pick them up  I go grocery shopping  shoe shopping  and clothing shopping   and except for food  none of it s my own  I shop online for clothes because there are simply not enough hours in the day to shop for me  And  yes  I go to and from soccer games and soccer practices for 2 of my 4 children  I spend a LOT of time in this car  If I could afford it  I would trade this in for almost anything else  but alas  the loan is still worth more than the car Now you know I hate it  This is why  cup holders  automatic door tracks  storage  keypad entry  3rd seat  gas mileage  snow  noise  and did I say cup holders Cup holders sounds like a trivial thing  but it s a big issue  There are two up front  They pop out with the ashtray  If you put in a heavy drink  whether a full water bottle or a coffee thermos  and you don t close the pinchers  the drink ends up on your foot  If it s heavy enough  it ll end up on your foot anyway the first time you make a turn  Also  I should note that if you want to recharge your cell phone of you have a passenger charging his laptop  he ll have to hold his drink  There is an additional port by the passenger  but it s so close to the floor that no cell phone could be used if plugged in and few laptop cords I own an SEL  It comes with a front console between the bucket seats  It has no additional cup holders in it  This is significant  SUVs often have a place for drinks on the console  Not the Windstar  There is no alternative place for cupholders for me  and no place to hold a drink for a kid who can t reach his her own cupholder  The SEL comes with 2nd row captain s chairs  The cup holders are near the floor of the chairs and flip down  Kids in carseats can t reach them at all  Younger children not in carseats still have trouble reaching them  Adults sitting in those seats have to grab the drink from the top  If it s a soda  or worse  coffee  from fast food  the top can and does pop off  The rear bench thankfully has decent cupholders  but they are the only ones  The Toyota Sierra has cup holders that fold into the sliding doors  Almost everyone else does NOT have the pinchers  With as much time as we spend in the car  it is unrealistic not to have the kids or me drink something at some part of the day  We get drinks spilled alot  Then the car starts to smell  It s amazing how fast and how bad a little orange soda or the smallest drop of a vanilla shake can smell  Don t discount this  Lack of useable cupholders is a big issue to anyone who drives   but especially those of us with children Automatic closing doors  The SEL has one on each side  The smallest piece of crayon  A stray nickel can keep it from closing  Sometimes these things get stuck in the track to the point where the door doesn t quite close  but can t then open easily either Storage  If you aren t using the third bench  the Windstar probably has plenty of room  I wouldn t know  I have 4 young children  Which means my options are either a minivan  with the 2nd and 3rd row intact or an extra large SUV  Anyone who owns an extra large SUV  and we do  knows that they are not the car that you take to zip in and out of busy parking lots  You may be able to park it  but you might have to choose which side of the car gets to exit  The doors are large and swing open wide  So  the third bench is stuck there  more on that later  That means there is less than 20 cu  ft of storage space behind it  That is peanuts folks  If I put an umbrella stroller back there  and that is the smallest version of stroller out there  I am hard put to fit a weeks worth of groceries in the back  If I put the stroller in the passenger compartment  then the kids trip on their way in and out  Even weekend trips tax our abilities to travel comfortably  You leave the umbrella stroller home  Add a portacrib  Give everyone a small duffle and that s it  You are out of room  Half the Windstars around here have luggage carriers permanently strapped to the roof with good reason Let s talk 3rd bench  It is big  It doesn t split in half  and it is heavy as hell  My oldest daughter lost her retainer in the car  I had to take out the third bench and both captain s chairs before I found it in the well of where one the chairs hooks in  I did it myself  I am a small but strong person  but I can tell you I hope I never have to do it again  Even with two people  getting the third seat out is unwieldy at best  And getting it back in is even worse  The manual sucks and the levers stick  And hope you never have to do it if you own one  Everything disgusting and vile congregates in those wells Keypad entry  All of Ford s SUVs have this feature  The SEL is the top of the line  It does not  If anyone is going to get locked out of their car  it s going to be a parent  Because their kid is going to close the door on them before they have removed the keys  Gas Mileage  If I m lucky I get 16 city and 17 5 highway  Not close to the 18 22 I live in a place that gets a lot of snow  It s an urban area and we have pretty good snow removal  The Windstar s version of ALLTrac isn t bad  However it s ground clearance is terrible  I have gotten stuck in parking lots and driveways where snow has built up by an exit or in the center of a lane  However  I think the ground clearance thing would be true of almost any Minivan Most of our relatives live a couple hours away  Once this car gets on the highway  it is LOUD  No joke  I don t hear as well out of my left ear  driver s window side  and with all the driving I do  I can t tell if it s from the car or the baby  who I usually carry on my left hip As I said  I have four small children  as in they would be crushed by airbags if they sat up front  I don t have a lot of choices in cars  And until I ve paid a little more off on my loan  I have no choices  Don t make the same mistake  The Grand Caravan has tons of room behind the third seat  I think almost twice as much as the Windstar  But if I was to get another Minivan  I think the Honda would be my car  That way  if I wanted to go to BJs  I could easily make the 3rd seat disappear  But  once this lemon is paid down  I m giving serious look at the Buick Rendevous  With the snow around here  Central Mass  I need something that can fit 4 kids easily  and please  NOT with a 2nd row seat that you have to pop up to get to the back bench  with more ground clearance that is still easy to park at the Soccer Field or the local Shop n Stop  
Neg, That is what I was told by a a Ford Motor Company engineer who I met with to discuss a vibration in the gas pedal at 2 250 RPM  since that time the vibration has gotten much worse  and at times the transmission hesitates shifting to the next highest gear  He also told me that his bosses 2000 Windstar had the same vibration  He stated to me that it was a  normal operating condition  to me it was not anything normal and I would not have purchased a 2000 Windstar if I would have noticed it during our test drive  The first time I noticed it was when we were driving 3 hours and I noticed it at highway speeds and my foot started falling to sleep  I questioned the engineer at the time if this was  normal  then why did Ford fix the problem in the 2001 models  He did not answer me  I did not have this vibration in my 1995 Windstar  why was it added in 2000 and removed in 2001  My concern is what does it mean  Could it be mismatched parts  incorrect tolerances  something wearing in the transmission    and will I have a problem after 36 000 miles are on the vehicle  Consumer Reports even suggests to stay away from several of the model year Windstars  including the 2000 model  additional note I talked to an ex engineer at Ford and he was not surprised what I was experiencing  because his parents complained about the same vibration in their 2000 Windstar  The questions to ask yourself is what did Ford change in newer models and why if in their words the issue in the 2000 model is a  normal operating condition  
Neg, I am a former Ford salesman  Yea  I sold a couple of Windstars  but practicaly had to give them away  Before I go in to this I want to say that it did receive a five star safety rating  which is the highest a vehicle can receive  Very safe  well from the impact of another vehicle  I was particulary excited to show couples the windstars at the dealership because there were always high bonuses on them  I sold a windstar that was a new 1999 model still leftover from a year ago at  6 000 00 under MSRP  And I made close to a thousand dollars of commission off that one van  The dealership took a big hit  but they were losing 3  a month for just having it on the lot  That happens after the vehicle sits on the lot for over 90 days but over 120 days it gets ridiculous for the dealership to hold on to  So if you have to have a Windstar make sure you Don t pay for it  Thats just the point of view of a salesman  not a high demand now that SUV s are popular  Think about an Expedition instead Low rating because of lack of popularity br br  
Neg, We had owned a Dodge caravan but swore off them when the transmission failed at 70k miles  The Windstar styling appealed to my wife and the safety features  side airbags  back up sensor  were not available on other vans of that year  The van is used primarily to carry the kids to school  swimming  etc  Gas mileage is not great 15 in town 19 highway  The first problem we had was excessive oil consumption  The dealer fixed it under warranty  The problem was never fully explained but we also had to have an update to the computer  fuel injector cleaning and an oil change  Cost  350 Next the automatic side doors started sticking open  These were adjusted by the dealer under warranty  We passed on the  had to have  cooling system flush  tire rotation and oil change  Saved  300 At 34k miles I wanted the transmission checked as it appeared to take too long to engage when shifting from P or N to D  Ford said there was nothing wrong with it and specifications allowed up to a 7 second delay  We had to have another computer update  a transmission service and an oil change  Cost  350 At 38k the front brakes had to be serviced  Pads and rotors were worn beyond acceptable  We didn t use the Ford dealer for this  Saved  300 At 44k miles the lower tie rod ends had to be replaced  Cost  279 plus the  had to have  fuel injector cleaning  cooling system service and battery test  Total cost  500 but after complaining to Ford we got  170 refunded against the tie rods At 48k the mass air flow sensor and the master cylinder pressure  speed  switch failed  Plus another update to the computer  Cost  450 And finally at 50k the transmission had to be rebuilt  Cost  1800 Additionally there is always some little thing going wrong  the electric seat  the radio speakers  the rear wiper  etc I like the looks of the van but I will never buy another Ford  
Neg, A friend of mine just paid more than  20 000 to try to get the comfort I have in a van almost ten years older and  13 000 cheaper  We have a 1990 model Ford Aero Star  This van is awesome and most comfortable  The Windstar has much less head room than the Aero Star  It is much easier to get in and out of the older van than the new one  Even with the so called upgrades Ford has established in their newer vans it is apparent they cut too many corners in developing the Windstar  Our Aero Star was modified by Qualico with more plush seats  and interior courtesy lights for each passenger  Even so  the Aero Star vans that I have traveled in that are just off the production line are hands down better than the Windstar  Aero Star were available with four wheel drive  This is not an option with the Windstar  If you only have town driving to contend with and real comfort isn t an issue buy yourself a Windstar  If you are looking for comfort and a more road compatible vehicle buy yourself a used Aero Star br br  
Neg, If you get this car  I would suggest getting a cell phone because it is going to leave you stranded  We bought a 92 Aerostar and as you can guess  It literally fell apart  We had to replace the engine  transmission  brake stuff  and many other vital parts  It left us stranded on I 17 200 miles from home with a 4 wheel drive  This means that you need a flatbed tow truck so that the gears didn t get screwed up  Also  The electronics fail all of the time  This means that the windows  radio  ignition  lights  air etc don t work  The car currently has multiple undetectable flaws that leave us wondering if we bought the wrong car  Now  We know  DO NOT BUY THIS CAR  The only thing good about it is the space  Any car company can do that though     
Neg, In  97 I bought a used  95 Windstar  Like another complaint listed  I also had continual problems with the door ding going off  I oiled  sprayed and slammed  but the ding and light keep going off and have learned to just keep the radio loud enough to ignor it  I replace the brakes 4 times in 3 years  transmission filter 3 times and Engine and ABS lights kept going on and off  When the van hit 100K miles  it self destructed  Suddenly gas started pouring out of the tailpipe  Replaced sparkplugs and wires thinking they may be worn out  Gas kept pouring out  I was informed by my mechanic it was the fuel injectors  at a cost of  129 each  6  plus labor  Gas kept pouring out  It came down to the computer which is neatly hidden in a 3 hour labor cost to just remove  Computer cost  260 plus labor of  900  After  3000 the van ran for two weeks when the whole brake line broke Here is where the van becomes extremely dangerous  When towed to a mechanic who specializes in racing cars began working on the brake line we made a shocking discovery  My mechanic tried to purchase another line from Ford  but they no longer MAKE it  While checking the path of why the brake line just blew out  my mechanic realized that the brake line is right next to the catalytic converter  The converter gets extremely hot  heating the line up and causing extreme pressure to the lines  Which eventually causes the line to break at a connection or melt down and explode  My mechanic claims this should cause a total design recall on the part of Ford  These vans could explode and you would not only lose your brakes  but perhaps your life I am happy to be alive  however someone else may not be so lucky br br  
Neg, We were rear ended while in our 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan  which I love to pieces  and had to have it repaired  Needing a mini van  we ended up with a 2000 Ford Windstar  Granted it was the lowest possible model that the rental agency purchases  but this van was terrible  It had the get up and go of a snail  and the blind spots  Boy  if you ever wanted to purchase a vehicle with really bad blind spots  this would have to be the one  You can turn  twist  and do all the maneuvering you want and you still can not see out of those rear windows  The vehicle felt too light for being the size it was  but then I am used to driving a 5500 lb Caravan  It did stop quite smoothly though  You did not have to mash on the brakes and throw everyone to the front of the van  The seats were a bit uncomfortable  and even in the basic model  for being the price they are  seemed to be missing quite a few features that you would expect to see  like something besides a plastic steering wheel  The road noise was also quite terrible  I felt like I was yelling to the passenger so they could hear me  Over all  I would not purchase one these  But please remember that this was a rental vehicle that we only had for a week  I would stick with my Caravan any day br br  
Neg, Make it simple Strengths  Huge cargo area with the rear bench seats removed   great when we moved Cruise control has been great on long trips   gas mileage hovers around 18 mpg highway  Weaknesses  Transmission has been the biggest problem so far   I m not pleased at the way the resale value is plummeting just 18 months after purchase  Book value is half of what I paid for it just 18 months ago   with 83 000 miles it may be time to cut my losses and go for a Suburban  Also  I don t like the fact that there are no headrests on the rear bench seats  SInce my kids are small  I didn t pay attention to it until some adult friends came along for the ride  and now I m paranoid of serious whiplash injuries if we ever get rear ended  Overall  I m getting my money s worth out of this car  but it could have been worse  I bought it used with 45 000 miles on it and the dealer put in a new transmission less than a week after I drove it off the lot  Fortunately this dealer offers a three month warranty on any used car so it did not cost me  However  the new transmission failed within a month so they replaced two sensors and put in another transmission  again at no cost  So far so good a year and a half later  The only major repair after another 35 000 miles is the steering arm on the front passenger side  otherwise just routine maintenance  After reading other reviews I guess I can t complain yet  The dealer has made all the difference so far   they have treated me great  I was in a loaner car for several days while the transmission was being fixed   great service and great attitude from the service team so far  and it s been the only reason I have continued to own Ford products  I had an Escort station wagon and a Ranger 4x4 before this  but nothing compares to my  95 Mazda 626  which gave me a quarter million miles of virtually maintenance free service before giving up the ghost  
Neg, First thing is  I did not purchase a Windstar  I rented the Windstar for 3 days  After the 1st 2 min  of driving this vehicle I instantly did not like it at all  This was a fairly loaded Windstar  the seats were horribly uncomfortable  It had powered seats  but no matter where I positioned them  my top of my back and up had no cushion  I can imagine what kind of whipplash I could expect if I was in a accident  Next I notice that  good ole  Ford continues to make cars without a choice of Circulated and Re Circulated ventilation  I think all the other car makers do  The ventilation system was very weak  The fan only had 4 speeds and the 2 lowest fluctuated dramatically  The buttons and temp  slide adjustment was very loose  I also noticed that the pedals where too close to the drivers seat  so the peddals where close the steering wheel was far  This vehicle had only 2400 miles on it  I m average size man  5 10 quot  When you get out of the van  to open the back door it s  quot locked quot  very annoying  The stereo had very small buttons  example was the am fm button  Ride was like a boat  a lot of swaying from side to side  engine noise was abundant and  quot throaty quot  Acceleration was uneven  sudden jumps when applying the accelerator  Braking was the worst  Very mushy and very hard to stop  I would not recommend this vehicle at all  Go purchase a Chrysler Minivan br br  
Neg, I bought this vehicle used in 1995 because I was expecting our first child and the sports car just would not do any longer  This was not my first choice for a sports utility but at the time the price was right  we paid  12 000 00 and it only had 40 000 miles on it  It was driven by an older gentlemen who had kept it in excellent condition and had only used the 4 wheel drive in snow  It has the Eddie Bauer package  power windows and doors  rear window defrost  cruise control  and a tow package  I loved it at first  but then after only a year  I started having problems with it  The check engine light would come on but whenever I stopped it would go off again  It spent 3 weeks in the shop with no problems found  On my way home from the shop  wouldn t you know it  the light came on  only this time it never went off  The shop at our Ford dealer said it was just a sensor gave me the bill for  856 84 and left me there almost in tears  Two weeks later  we started the same process with the rear anti lock brake light  Three years later I am still driving with this light on as no one can figure out how to fix it  To make a long story short  we have  in 6 years  replaced the oil pump 5 times  the brakes I couldn t tell you how many times  and other items relating to the engine so many times that we finally had it rebuilt in 1999 and I am still having problems with it stalling all the time  It now has 152 000 miles on it  I love to drive this type of vehicle when it is running correctly  I can see where I am going  even in the pouring rain  I live out in the boondocks so I really need this type of vehicle to get in my driveway at times  I would recommend a sport utility in a heartbeat  just not this particular one  It has cost me almost twice what I paid for it in mechanical bills  There are parts on this vehicle oil pump  battery  water pump  fuel pump  that you can count on breaking within a certain number of miles  So whenever it gets close to the mileage on these parts  I just stay close to home  The wrecker service in this area is on speed dial on my cell phone br br  
Neg, I bought my 1990 Ford Bronco 2 years ago  It has a 350 5 8L V8 4X4  I bought it for  5000 00 and have spent that much plus more getting it fixed  It had one owner before me  When I got it it ran really great  at first  The windshield leaks  the front of the roof leaks so everytime it rains the inside of my truck gets wet  It also leaks wear the pedals are  It is currently in the shop getting the back brakes replaced plus all of the seals the axle that the brakes destroyed  My engine has  800 00 worth of work to be done  I have replaced my left window motor twice and the left door lock motor once  The air conditioner is also being worked on  I have replaced the exhaust system  The 4X4 has also had to be replaced  I know I m forgetting other things  I only get 12 mpg and with gas prices the way they are it costs me around  200 00 a month  Right now I have 175 000 plus miles and a very big headache  I am a little person and feel very safe in this big truck but that is about the only good thing about it  DO NOT buy this vehicle Any one who has a Bronco I wish them the best of luck  I think its time I get something else     
Neg, We searched for and decided on this truck after the little Isuzu we had conked out  We bought this truck with 13000 miles on it  This is my husbands truck which I don t like to drive but have to sometimes  What is there about the truck that I don t like  I will try to be fair The truck is just a plain pickup truck nothing fancy  It is an XLT 2 door regular cab  and has a 4 cylinder engine and automatic transmission b Features   Automatic Steering  The steering handles well and responds to the touch Antilock Brakes  They work  Air Conditioning Cools off quickly  Heat takes a little longer to kick in  Power Windows  This has a neat feature that I wish my van had  When the ignition is switched off the button that operates the power windows can be used if the door hasn t been opened  I always end up having to put the key back in my van and switching it on to operate the windows Stereo with cassette and CD player Shutoff switch for airbag on passenger side  Can only switch on or off with the key  This is a great safety feature if you have a small child riding in the passenger seat or a toddler car seat There is a third window in the truck that is in the back windshield  This window slides back and forth like a sliding glass door b Comfort   The Seat Belts are adjustable for comfort The Seat has a lumbar support that helps ease the strain riding or driving There is not much leg room between the dash board and the seat  The seat slides back and forth and is adjustable  There is only room for two people in this truck  there is a third seat belt but it would have to be a small child to ride comfortably The instrument panel is convenient and easy to reach for the driver and passenger b What I like  I like the way the steering responds  I like the safety switch for the airbag b  What I don t like  I do not like the way it handles on a wet road  The truck is light and feels as if it slides when it is raining  If there is a strong wind the truck sways  The power of this truck is okay to drive on the freeway without getting run over  The Ranger drives okay in regular traffic and driving on regular roads  Going up a hill or steep bridge it feels like it is straining to keep up speed  Times like this is when I wish I had a straight shift  The bed of the truck is big enough to hold a good size load we have used it to move a daughters furniture  It drives more stable to me when it has a load  I would not use this truck to pull a boat and trailer There has been a problem with the light that tells you a door is open  It comes on when all the doors are closed and locked  I think my husband finally got it fixed The noise level of this truck is high to me  My husband says it is normal but it still sounds awfully noisy I would not buy another one  For driving back and forth to work and hauling groceries it is fine  I would not take a trip in it to the mountains  
Neg, Okay  I m not totally anti Ford Explorer  They re decent cars  And I think the Firestone tire thing is not a major concern  But the 2000 and 2001 Explorer doesn t handle as well as other cars in its class  namely the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Nissan Pathfinder  It s just no comparison  Maybe it s the  quot one body quot  thing  Explorer is put together from different parts rather than molded from one piece of steel  All I know is  my 2000 Explorer  which I sold after 3 months  can t touch my new 2001 Pathfinder  nor my 1998 Jeep  which I leased before the Explorer And there were other problems  For instance  there was a lot of rattling  Whenever I got out of the car after driving  I could here all sorts of  quot pings quot  and other noises  But the car was  supposedly  in excellent shape  And it drove okay  but I constantly felt like I was driving a big truck  and would flip on quick turns   not so on the Pathfinder  or the new Jeeps  or more expensive SUVs  except the Mercedes Explorers have some major positives  Keyless entry is great  And the headlights are incredibly bright  which is a nice thing if you live in a rural area  But the Jeep s computer and the Pathfinder s better stereo and related features  see my Pathfinder review  more than make up for those loses If you have a good deal on a used or new Explorer  I am not saying to definitely pass it up  I would just check out the Pathfinder and Jeep   and drive them all  a lot  around curves  on the interstate  before you pick one  On SUVs  handling is the most important thing  i e  does it feel like a car or a truck  and I think Explorers finish last in their class br br  
Neg, That 2001 Ford Explorer you may be considering is not as new as you think  Sure  it smells new  it s shiny  and it looks modern  but the mechanicals underneath are anything but new The explorer started out life in 1990  It was at the time  a break through  It handled nicely for a truck  had lots of room for people  pets  and cargo  and did everything well  The public reacted by making it the best selling sport utility vehicle in the country  and ever since  it has held that title  I can see the practical reasons why Americans hold this SUV so dear after a number of hours behind the wheel of my company s jet black 2001 Explorer 4x4 4 door XLS The explorer does everything well for 90  of American drivers  The afformentioned room  reliability  towing ability  and resale value have made it a hit here But I am one of those 10  of Americans who would find the Explorer lacking  Compared to new SUV s  the explorer feels every bit of 10 years old  Don t get me wrong  I owned a 1991 explorer for 5 years when it was new  and I liked it  But compared to newer SUV s  the Jeep Grand Cherokee for one  the steering feels dead and it handles like a much bigger vehicle  The stock ford stereo is among the worst sound systems I have heard in a modern car  It is a stereo cassette unit with very bad accoustics  and to get normal driving volume  the stereo needs to be half way cranked up Spend a little more and go for the all new from the ground up 2002 model  It handles much better  is roomier  and can finally truly compete with the modern crop of SUV s  
Neg, I used to have this car  Note the  used to  part  It was sold for a much nicer Honda Accord  The first thing you notice while test driving the  97 Explorer is how bumpy the ride is  The shocks are a little too hard  even for an SUV  Going over speedbumps at 5mph feels like driving over a boulder in any other car After about 3 days of normal driving  you ll have to fill up the gas tank  And probably by that time you ll need an oxygen mask while you drive  The pollution from this thing is tremendous  typical of any wonderful Ford  It s barely within our State s legal limits  even brand new  The gas mileage is advertised to be between 15 16 for a V8  but it doesn t achieve even that  I found that under normal driving conditions  I could get maybe 12 miles to a gallon  if I was lucky  Normally I got 10 or 11 on the average  Pretty terrible  yes The suspension on this Explorer was horrendous  Every time you brake  the suspension creaks and groans under the stress  I tried to have it fixed while under warranty  but nothing could be done  Even replacing the entire suspension system did no help  Plus  the driver s side seatbel 
Neg, I am a Mother of 3 small children who decided the time had come to purchase a minivan  After reading as many car magazines as I could get my hands on I narrowed the search to the Ford Windstar SEL  and the Honda Odyssey EX  Both of these models were new for 1999 and they were the only ones who offered automatic doors  a seemingly great feature for a mother with small kids  At the time the Windstar had a 5 star safety rating  the Odyssey was not rated  The Windstar was readily available  the Odyssey had a 6 week wait  The Windstar was a nicer looking vehicle  I purchased the Windstar It did not take long for me to realize that I had made a terrible mistake  When we picked up the vehicle  we noticed the door did not close flush to the vehicle  The service department repaired it  One month later  the car battery died while picking up carpool  back to the service department  Since that time I have been to the service department for a rear view mirror falling off  the gas gauge not being accurate  the door molding falling off  and a clicking noise from the steering column  These however  are only the problems that they repaired  To this day  the vehicle at times exhibits a  quot surging quot  sensation when going from drive to reverse or vice versa that they can not fix  In addition  the automatic doors are a HUGE safety concern  The Ford dealers will tell you that the automatic doors retract automatically if there is something in the way  What they don t tell you is that you need to exhibit force against the door for it to do this  For an adult this can be done  although I have been bruised before  however a small child can easily be injured  In addition  the buttons for the automated doors are located within reach of a child  This makes for a fun toy for the child and a nightmare for the parent  You may think I was unfortunate to get a lemon  However  I have searched the internet and have found a high number of other Windstar owners who are experiencing the same problems that I have encountered  I have also read of other owners having the front wheel fall off  many electrical problems  and I read of a child who s foot was badly injured from the doors  If you are considering purchasing this vehicle I suggest you visit www cartrackers com and www edmunds com  Look through the forums and town halls and you will be amazed at the number of unhappy Windstar owners I should also mention that Ford Motor Company has one of the worst customer service departments that I have ever come across  If you want to speak to a supervisor you have to wait for them to call you  and if you are not home you are just out of luck   case closed The Windstar may be nice looking inside and out  but remember  looks aren t everything br br  
Neg, I will be upfront with you from the beginning and tell you that I am not a Ford fan  But that has nothing to do with the opinion I am about to write  My family of 5 traveled to Hawaii for a vacation  We had reserved a mini van on the Big Island  Of course we didn t know what we d get  we were willing to take whatever they gave us at the rental agency  Ford  GM  Toyota  whatever  Well  they gave us a Ford Windstar  which was fine  When we walked to the van  it was a nice looking van and we thought this would be a nice experience to get over some of our dislike for past Ford products we ve had bad experiences with First problem was   we couldn t even fit all of our luggage into the  hatchback  area  some of it had to go into the back seat with one person sitting there  Yes  I know we could pack lighter  but believe me  we were within reasonable limits  Had no trouble getting it on the planes  in fact we didn t max out our limits there   Next problem was the first time the driver opened the drivers door he wacked himself on the head because the door kind of curves down and in  making it so you have to pay attention every time you open the door  No stitches were involved but he did have a nasty looking cut for the duration of our trip Next problem is that the middle seat in the back doesn t go all the way to the  edge  of the vehicle  like the Astro or Safari s do  so the adults who were riding in the middle seat had difficulty getting in and out comfortably  and when you are sightseeing  there is a lot of getting in and out And my last complaint has nothing to do with Ford  but we had to laugh when we left the rental agency in Kona  flew to Honolulu to rent another van for a week and got another Windstar  We asked for something different but they didn t have anything available  Since we d already paid for it before our vacation  we didn t have the heart to walk away and try a different rental agency I do know that in the future I won t rent  or buy  a Ford Windstar There were some good points about it  Like I said at the beginning  it is a nice looking vehicle  it does drive nice and I particularly liked the rear controlled air conditioning br br  
Neg, We originally leased a 1998 Ford Windstar and LOVED it  We then turned it in at the end of the lease and bought a 1999 Windstar anticipating we d enjoy it also  HATED IT  First of all  it doesn t look as sleek as the 98  Secondly  it sometimes rides like a truck  not a car  After the wonderful experience of the 98  I don t understand what happened with the 99  It doesn t have as much room as the 98 either  The good thing is that it does have rear doors on both sides now  The bad thing is that you can only enter the second rear seat from one side it would be very helpful to enter from both sides  Also  there s no longer a door lock for the automatic lock at the rear door  The sound system is good though  You should buy this vehicle if you have never had a mini van before  you will love it because you won t have any comparison  Also  it does ride well after the 1st 5000 miles and it s great for long highway trips  And for the money  it s probably one of the best values you can get  Even though I don t love the car  I will say it s not a totally awful car  If I had never purchased the 98  I would probably think it s great  It has done great in safety tests br br  
Neg, We bought our 1999 Windstar SE in August 1999  We looked at the Windstar  the Honda Odyssey  the Nissan Quest  and the Dodge Caravan  We decided on the Windstar even though we would have preferred the Odyssey  We didn t want to wait 3 months or pay over invoice  We ended up with a completely loaded woodland green SE model because at the end of the 1999 model year  the only SEL we could find was gold  The only option we didn t add was the backing up sensors  the beeping thing  This is basically an SEL without the two tone paint What we like We like the controls  They are very logically placed and if you have a large drink in the drink holder  it doesn t block the radio or other controls  the Quest was the worst for this We like the looks  It is a very nice looking van  in our opinion We love the dual remote controlled sliding doors  My two year old loves to play with the buttons  so for now  we have it turned off on the main control and I only use the remote for it right now  I m concerned too about safety  I stuck the large plastic key holder box at the dealership in the door as it closed and it dented it  I have VERY small hands and no way would I test it with my hand  Not worth the risk  The salesman did it though and the door opened back up It is very easy to get my 2 kids in and out of  10 months old and 2 1 2 years old It has a very nice  albeit noisy  ride  It drives a lot like my 1998 Honda Accord did  I replaced the Accord with the Windstar What we don t like The windshield washer button is on the end of the blinker control  I can t tell you how many times I ve washed the windshield while turning the corner  LOL  This might seem petty  but it is driving me crazy It is noisy  Not in terms of squeaks and rattles  but general road noise  poor insulation  My older son likes to sit in the  quot way back quot  and I can barely hear him talking  It is quieter than the Caravan though I slammed the middle two fingers of my right hand in the passenger sliding door the first time I closed it from the inside  The handle placement is VERY POORLY DESIGNED  If you don t completely wrap your fingers around the handle  WATCH OUT when you close the door from the inside  I m afraid to close it now I ve never gotten more than 15 miles per gallon and I drive 80  highway  The manufacturer claims 17 city 23 highway  The dealer said there is nothing wrong with it  It s not my driving though  because I get 15 mpg in my husband s Tahoe which has a huge V 8 engine and weighs twice as much While this is not necessarily a bad minivan  I would not buy this car again  I m already wishing for a new one We have not had this car in for repairs yet  we ve had it 6 months  but I have heard some weird transmission noises when putting in reverse  It also shifts from reverse to drive with a clunk and sometimes a lurch UPDATE 1 11 04 We ve had this car for 3 5 years now  It has about 38 000 miles on it  Most of our complaints repairs have been nuisances  However  last summer  we had to replace the entire steering system at a cost of about  1 400  The cruise control  from the beginning  has only worked when it wants to work  not necessarily when we want it to work  They can t fix it because it always seems to work when we take it to the shop  The rear air stopped working  and luckily that turned out to be a fuse  The automatic doors occasionally don t work  We had the transmission reprogrammed  and it doesn t clunk anymore We are in the process of trying to sell this car as we have replaced it with a 2004 Honda Pilot  which we absolutely LOVE  
Neg, Fortunately I did not pay for this minivan  I took delivery of it in April 1999 as my company vehicle  I ve driven company vehicles since 1973 and have looked after them as if they were my own  I have always purchased them afterwards but this Windstar will probably be the first exception in 28 years When I drove it home from the dealer and parked in my driveway  the hood looked like had condensation on it  Unfortunately this was such a poor paint job it looked like someone had used an aerosol paint can to do it  I immediately took it back to the dealer where I was met with complete indifference and was told to  take it round the back to the collision centre  They wouldn t replace the hood and would only repaint it  Three days later I arrived home with the new Windstar  a paint job and 12 miles on the odometer Once the weather warmed up the engine began to ping premature detonation of fuel mixture  at 1800 RPM  I heard all sorts of reasons from  it s your ashtray  to  you must have had the van gassed up while playing the radio  this corrupts its processor  I had it in 7 times for this pinging until in September 2000 the engine rattled so bad that it clunked to a standstill  totally seized at 25 000 miles  It took over a week to have a replacement recycled  engine installed and the Ford dealer would NOT provide a loaner Once the weather warmed up in 2001 the pinging started again with the second engine  This time I went to another Ford dealer in the next town  This dealer was excellent and within two visits have almost eliminated the ping by recalibrating the processor and installing a new style valve cover which has an additional baffle to prevent oil vapors from being burnt Other poor points Radio cuts out when a passenger gets into van  This is annoying when listening the news in a parking lot Radio sometimes stays on when driver removes key and leaves van  When this happens  the power windows are still  live  this appears to have drained the battery several times  Now I always check before exiting The horn is difficult to use  You must first find the seam on the large airbag cover as it s the only part that will sound the horn quite dangerous Windshield appears to have a badly shaped area right in front of the driver which won t clean properly in icy weather Seats are rather thin and small  I was in Europe recently and my small econobox car over there had proper seats that actually were wide and comfortable  The Windstar has lots of wasted space either side of the seats The roof on Windstars has a strange seam on either side which appears to be filled with a hard putty  The paint soon cracks on this material Rear speakers are intermittent because of poorly designed spring loaded contacts on sliding doors  I often clean them to get the rear speakers to work In damp weather the plastic panels squeak Rear licence plate shield   light holders broke off Huge turning circle makes these vans cumberson to park in tight locations Good points Good safety rating Heating and air conditioning works well Nice safe orange rear turn signals instead of confusing red ones Engine is quite powerful but harsh if working hard Fuel economy is actually not bad on long highway runs  
Neg, I purchased a 1999 Windstar in November 1998  Initially  the car operated perfectly  However at 10 200 miles  the car locked up while in drive and nothing I could do would get it to move  After about 25 seconds  the car surged forward very fast and I had to slam on the brakes to keep from hitting a car crossing in front When the light turned green the car operated normally The dealer in Tampa replaced several computer  transmission parts and assured me that everything was ok  Three weeks later it did it again  The dealer could find nothing wrong with the car Upon moving to Alabama in July  the car repeated the lock up  I explained to the dealer that it was a safety issue and that I could be killed if I accelerated from a stop sign and the car refused to move for 20 seconds and then surged into traffic  Again  they could find nothing wrong and there were no tech bulletins from Ford addressing such a problem  In January 2000  we were left sitting in a busy intersection when the car refused to go and then in 15 20 seconds  surged into traffic  The Ford dealer contacted the regional rep and they promised me a new transmission in one week  Three and one half weeks later  the transmission arrived and seemed to be ok  The second week  I noted that the transmission abruptly downshifted at about 42 miles per hour and slowed very quickly even though I was accelerating  It was as though I had downshifted to  quot 1 quot  The dealer gained access to a tech bulletin and adjusted the transmission  Today I drove and found that the transmission does not downshift at 42 MPH  it downshifts at 53 miles per hour  So much for Ford tech bulletins  so much for  quot Reliability is job one quot  I have written complaints to and called the NHTSB and they have done nothing  I have called Ford several times without success  Has anyone else had similar problems  If so  did you avail yourself of the Lemon Law  Did Ford offer a financial incentive to purchase another Ford product br br  
Neg,  updated Jan 03 Hello all  an update to my windstar review is required  For those of you that do not tend to keep your vehicles for long periods  you may not care  for those of you that plan to keep your vehicle for 3 years or more  please read my update at bottom I never thought we would buy a mini van  I never liked the shapes  some of them look like bugs  Then I saw someone driving the 1999 Ford Windstar and I fell in love  I sent my husband to look at them  and he fell in love  Why First off  let me explain that we have 2 children  one in a booster seat and one in an infant seat  Plus  my husband is 6 feet 6 inches  We had to upgrade our car to a bigger car  a SUV or a Mini Van  The car seats and my husband could not fit in our car anymore  We tried numerous SUV s but none of them in our price range  around 25k  could fit my husband with the seat all the way back and the infant carrier  Until we got to the Windstar  We all fit very comfortably in it  My husband can finally drive a car without his knee s being in his chest  The only place he cannot fit is BEHIND the 2nd bench row  But  even when he is sitting in the second row  he is very comfortable  We purchased the LX model with 2 doors  one of which is an automatic door  For the additional money we spent on it  I was leary of it  However  its fantastic  How many times do the kids run to the car to wait for you to open the doors  not anymore  just press the button and they can get in and start getting buckled in  I have found that my mini van is getting excellent mileage  I can go about 260 miles with a full tank before i HAVE TO get gas  The car is user friendly and I love the overhead compartments that comes with the back seat headphone jacks so the kids can listen to their music and I dont have to The main thing that I do not like about it is that I keep the 3rd row seats in because I never know when I am going to need it  however  then I don t have a lot of room for my groceries Also  they sell a cargo net  but really they should include it for safety so that bag of canned goods wont fall on our feet One tip  no matter what car you are purchasing  I almost could not afford the monthly payments for this car  Until we went online and found a dealership near us  not the one we were using  that specialized in online selling  We drove to them  about 10 miles from us  and we got about  3 000 in savings because we used the internet to locate them  so keep your eyes open Jan 05  04  Update  We have now owned our mini van for 4 years and 6 months  I have put somewhat more then average miles on it  i now have 62 000 miles on it  I have to say that i am looking to sell my car asap and will not get another ford windstar again  Since my car was 1 year old  i have had MAJOR mechanical problems  of course these problems  big and small  were completly covered under the warrenty  I have had 2 new transmissions  a new axel  8 tires  and i do service regularly including rotation  fuel pump problems  many recalls  automatic door problems  new brakes added  humm  what else  i have had to have the lines flushed  air conditioner fixed  cd player replaced  had to have the entire power sliding door mechanism replaced  new front and rear break pads and rotors can i think of anything else  well i m sure there is more it will come to me  Unfortunatly  i have also had major problems since my warrently expired that i have had to pay out of pocket for  Since my warrently expired in july  2002  I have spent about  4500 on car parts service not including normal servicing  I am shocked that i have had these problems  but when we take our car into the dealer  we find that others have these problems too  It also seems that the dealers have trouble correcting our problems the first time because we somehow always seem to have to go back to get the same problem fixed 2 or 3 times before it actually gets corrected  yet  the service people never fail to remind me that the most important thing to them is getting an  excellent  rating on any survey card i receive afterwords  yeah  like thats gonna happen  Inside  everything is ok  i still like the look  the space  the price  etc but i will never get a ford windstar again due to the mechanical problems that i should not have with a car with only 49 000 miles and a provable service record  
Neg, The vehicle that I am reviewing is a 1999 Ford Windstar mini van  This is a company leased vehicle that is presently assigned to me while my new Crown Vic is on order  This van is as underpowered as the three Aerostar vans that preceded it  This van has the ability to SOUND like it is picking up speed  but it is only an illusion  The engine revs up and it sounds powerful  but alas you can not see the speedometer climb faster  Other than this being underpowered the roominess and creature comforts are average  The average gas mileage is 15 MPG with most of the miles on the freeway  This vehicle would be an OK choice if it s primary chore was toting junior to soccer or mom to the supermarket  If this van is to be used in a commercial operation the Chevy ASTRO would be a better choice br br  
Neg, When I went on vacation with my girlfriend and her family to Washington DC  from Milwaukee  they rented a Ford Winstar to drive there  Well  that was a huge mistake First of all  the minivan is really crampt  There were five of us and we were all squished together  There is no leg room and the trunk area is pretty small  There is a ton of wasted space up by the dash board and the seats are smaller so they could put in drink holders  Once we got on the road  we found out how loud the van was  I sat in the back of the van and I could not even talk to the person in the front because the car was so loud  There were two main sources of noise  the road and the vents  The vents are on the ceiling and let out this loud hissing noise whenever they are on  Also  we couldn t listen to the radio because there no speakers in the back and we couldn t hear the front speakers over all of the other noise The engine  I think it was a V 6  was underpowered and took a lot to accelerate  The van drove like a tank and did not have many extra features  Also  for a new van  the air conditioning barely worked  Overall  I was really disappointed in the car  but I have come to expect that from Ford  I will never rent a Ford car or van again br br  
Neg, I loved it the moment my mom drove up in her new Windstar  I said  my next van would be just like it  but in white  So when it was time to trade in the old van  I jumped at the chance to get my 1999 Windstar  It had low miles  just under 36 000  and still had a bit of warranty left on it  Sad to say  it just wasn t enough time to find out what was truly wrong with my newly acquired vehicle The first week we had it  the lights began to flicker inside  We assumed that a door was ajar  but the warning light was not illuminating  We found out it was one of the many sensors inside the door  That  luckily was replaced free under the warranty Within a few weeks came a new problem  The back windshield wiper  would work only if you slammed the back hatch door  Another sensor is what I was told  and that bill was on me  We replaced the sensor  yet a few weeks later  it was on the blink again  This time  it was  as we were informed  a faulty switch  and would cost us to repair it  Needless to say  we don t have a back wiper at the moment Soon after this  I noticed that my rear view mirrors were vibrating while we were driving down the road  Figuring it was in need of balancing  I had the tires and alignment done  This did not help at all  and the vibration was just getting worse Just when I thought nothing else could go wrong  I found out that it could  The service engine light continually comes on and no amount of times that we have it on the  expensive  computer to test it they can find no valid reason for the problem As my transmission was shifting rather hard  I asked the dealer what it could be  I was then informed that the 1999 Windstar is notorious for having transmission troubles  This rebuild job is to cost me over  1600 00 No I will not be repairing anything else on the van  It is going to be a trade in  just as soon as possible I have heard from others who have this year Windstar  that there are two types of 1999 Windstars  The first being the one that never has a problem  and has grateful owners  And the second being the 1999 Windstars that got all the problems they could pack into one vehicle  Guess which one we bought  
Neg, First of all  I would like everyone to know that this is my first time in epinions because i want everyone to know what problems we ve been having wih our 99sel We bought the van last jan 99 my mom was suppose to get an odyssey minivan but we had to wait for about 3 to 6 months which we should have done It is actually my mom s van she s been really taking good care of it  15 months only 8000 miles It s been to the dealer a lot of times with different problems  first one we noticed blemishes on left rear behind the sliding door  no quality control noticed a big blemish like that which was impossible to miss The dealer where we got the van had it brought to a bodyshop no problem with dealership they were nice  amp  helpful it took about 2 days then we got it back that was fixed then the electronic display on the van was reporting that there s a charging problem so we goback to the dealer it was the alternator  so now they have to replace the alternator so this was solved  And now the biggest problem THE AUTOMATIC SLIDING DOOR one day it just wont shut tight it closes but it opens up a little bit on both doors so another visit to the dealer they adjusted it so it was ok for a while Then it started doing it again so back to the dealer they adjusted it again now it got worse you could hear it scratching something inside the railing so now were up to the point of getting tired of this problem  Now they are gonna change the two sliding doors if it  s still not fixed then I think it is a lemon Because I think this vans were the first batch to come out that s why it has all this problems  onna have to call ford soon br br  
Neg, I bought the vehicle when it was 1 year old and had 32000 miles  It looked terrific I bought an extended warranty In that year and a half I had to do the following Replace the rear window motor Replace the Tires Replace the Brakes  700 00 4 Safety related recalls Replace the front windshield wiper motor Replace a heater vent damper  300 00  mostly labor  or I wouldn t have heat Check engine light came on  they replaced the valve cover with a  revised design Two weeks later  the Check Engine Light came on again  this time they replaced the Intake manifold gasket with a  revised design  plus a bunch of other emission control stuff that apparently got ruined by the bad gasket Even though Ford paid for a portion of a couple of these repairs under the warranty  I had to pay deductibles  pay for rental cars  they only had a loaner once  and only helped defray one of the rentals once  and the majority of all repairs was not covered by the warranty  I spent several thousand dollars to keep the vehicle running over the course of a year and a half Other issues that I did not try to fix Squeaks  thumps  bumps  rattles  plastic interior pieces that got warped by the sun  gaskets falling off all the time around doors  overall sloppy assembly and bad fit and finish My actions speak louder than anything I could write  I meant to keep this van for 10 years  but it was so bad I dumped it after a year and a half  
Neg, We bought our 1999 Windstar LX used towards the end of my pregnancy with our third child  This is our first minivan   wanted to make sure it was well rated and safe  so we did a lot of checking around  The first 8 months went by without incident  but since then we have had nothing but problems  Ironically  it all started immediately following recall service  The first problem was a wiring issue  It had died on me on my way home   we had to have it towed  They found that there were wires that had apparently been cut under the dashboard  This was not covered  being that  we found out then  our warranty had expired not by mileage  but years we were told by the salesman we had 1 year   almost 18 000 miles left  As I was driving home from picking it up from that service  I noticed the check engine light was on  Upon checking my manual when returning home  it said to drive the vehicle through 3  cycles  before taking it for service  I did that   found out a week later that we had an oxygen sensor that needed to be replaced  Also  not covered  I did at least get them to take the diagnostic charge off  being that whoever test drove it after the service should have seen the check engine light  Anyway  moving on  next there was the idle problem I could start the car   it would run as long as I had my foot on the gas pedal  Apparently a valve was getting stuck open   had to be replaced  Immediately after this problem was fixed  I traveled to Georgia to visit friends    upon trying to return home my transmission went out  At 30 000 miles  Luckily  the only thing that happened is that the overdrive light started flashing after being on the highway for a few minutes    I returned to my friend s house  I have read about incidents where the van accelerates on its own  or takes off into reverse  2 weeks after trying to go home and a lot of stress  I made it home with my infant   2 sons just in time for school to start  I got the dealer to cover half of the costs  they have  hidden warranties  they don t tell you about called p05 and p07  but it was still  1200  Needless to say I will not only never buy another Ford  but I would strongly agree with others stating how awful Ford customer service is  Do a search on the internet about Windstars   you will find as much information on transmission   steering rack problems as you do for the Caravans  They say the customer service is supposed to be improving  but I don t believe selling cars that they know have problems is good customer service  This has been a KNOWN problem for years  
Neg, I was shopping for a new vehicle and wanted something bigger  I thought I wanted a mini van  it had to have room for kids and dogs and lots of  stuff  I did a few some quick polling of people and realized that no matter what brand they were either loved or hated I went to a local dealer and found a 1999 Ford Windstar LX  It was a nice van with only 46000 miles on it  Luckily I went on a Saturday afternoon and an agreement was reached where I would drive it over Sunday  Easter  and come back to finalize the deal on Monday On the test drive with the dealer it did fine except for the door sensors dinging whenever we hit a big bump  I was told that was common and would be cleaned and fixed  I really enjoyed the comfort of the drivers chair  it was truly like being in my living room chair and the ergonomics of the controls were great My girlfriend loved the ride as well and was sold on that aspect of the van  However  as we began our drive for Easter dinner  the mechanical nature of the van began to show  First  the sensors for the doors that had just beeped and flashed when we hit hard bumps began beeping and flashing for almost any bump or curve  That is very aggravating and distracting  More worrisome at highway speeds the steering was awful and very  mushy  for lack of a better word  You could turn the wheel almost a quarter of a turn with no response and then the van would lurch the direction you were turning  Every now and then the transmission would slip just a little  The brakes gave once or twice as we were sitting at a stop light Luckily I had not paid for the thing yet and was able to return it  I did a lot more reading that night and found out all of these problems were rather common in a Windstar  I took the beast back to the dealer on Monday morning and drove home in an older Nissan Pathfinder with more miles  It may not be as comfortable but I have no doubt I can be driving it in ten years with well over a hunred thousand miles on it If you are thinking about a Windstar beware  
Neg, We Bought our 1999 Windstar in December of 2000  It had 26 000 miles on it  We bargiend with the dealer and got a 6 year 120K warrenty too  First Impression We liked the Deep Red  Like a good wine  hence the name  Dark Cabernet Red  The interior was nicley appointed  but looked like it was done on the cheap  The tires where also cheap  but I blame that on the dealers replacements  It had a good radio and good a c and comfertably fit a family of 6 Drivetrain The 3 8 V 6 has plenty of get up and go  It gets 17 around towan and 23 on the interstate  The transsmisson usually shifts smothly Handling Fine  It does become a bit hard to handle in an emergancy situation  but its fairly easy to control  The dealer had put Ameri General tires on it  We replaced them with a good set of Dunlops  It brakes ok Interior Cheap  Several small plastic bits fell off and the rear a c control fell out during hard braking  The rear a c worked well  the seats where comfertable for road trips and my family never complained  The CD Cassette delivered pleanty of good rich sound  Reliablity Here is my complaint and why we no longer have this van  Ford doesn t make good trannies and this one was no exception  It was worse than normal  It whent out around 60K  Fortunatly the extended warrenty picked that up  Plus it had numorus electrical issues  the interior was falling apart and it just wasn t well built  I had all the usual Windstar problems  do a little reserch like Car Trackers  and you ll see what I mean  I wouldn t reccomend this to any one  
Neg, This is an update from a review I previously done almost two years ago  First my wife and I test drove several of the competitors at the time before we decided on the Ford Windstar SEL  Because I had a friend who was a Fleet Manager at one of the Ford dealerships  I was able to purchase this vehicle for thousands of dollars less  Which was a good thing because as time went on  I would have to use the money I saved to the repairs that were needed to be done after the warranty expired  Here is my evaluation in several areas of the vehicle Handling  It is very similar to all the competitors out there  My van had the upgraded suspension and 16  alloy wheels  Going through turns at speed elicits some body roll but that is to be expected for a tall vehicle  Turning radius could be better  Both Toyota and Honda bests the Ford in this measurement  The power steering in this vehicle is somewhat too boosted for my taste which means numb road feel  I have the sense of being detached from the road  The suspension absorbs large and small bumps very well to the point of almost feeling like being in a large cruise ship  0 60 in this mini van is approximately 9 5 seconds  making it one of the fastest minivans available  Much of the credit for the handling can be derived from the use of the Windstar platform actually using the Taurus platform  Comfort  You could almost live in the Captain s chairs that are standard in this vehicle  It even has power lumbar supports for both front seats  The only thing missing is memory seating  Seven people definitely can fit in this vehicle more comfortably than the Toyota but is about the same in the Honda  Long trips in any of the seats will not elicit lower back pains  Freeway driving elicits 71dB on my sound level meter  For comparison  the Toyota and the Honda both registered 70dB  Wind noise is subdued  only engine noises when revved is somewhat loud  Even today  the mini van doesn t emit any squeaks or rattles  Interior Features  Power seats for both driver and passenger seats with power lumbar supports  Leather seating  AM FM Stereo Cassette with CD  On Board Diagnostic Computer with outside temperature and compass  power mirrors  power windows  keyless entry with remote open closing of sliding doors  This was the first year Ford introduced an additional sliding door on the driver s side  Auto headlight feature  interior child light  fake wood trim  tinted windows  Separate A C and heating compressors for the front and rear passengers  baby view mirror  garage door  coin and cupholders  security alarm and auto anti glare rearview mirror  At the time  Honda s mini van did not offer leather seating unless you went to an aftermarket place to have it done  Ingress Egress  The only weakness here is that the second row Captain s chairs are not moveable to one side  They move up similar to cars that only have two doors  If you are like me and have two kids in car seats and they take up the second row  it is difficult for adults to enter the third row to sit  You may want to choose the second row as a bench seat so that passengers will have room to sit in the third row more easily  Getting in the driver s seat or front passenger seat is very easy because of the large doors and low step in height which is similar to most large passenger automobiles  Drivetrain  This is the mini van s weakness  It is a four speed automatic with overdrive that you can defeat for those long uphill climbs so that the transmission will not have to hunt for the right gear to use  The transmission is smooth when it is working properly  The problem I experienced with the transmission was at 29 511 miles into the use of the mini van  I had to rebuild the transmission  Yes  I had to have the transmission rebuilt  Of course this expensive repair at  1200 happened when my original factory warranty ended  The dealership denied my claim for warranty service even though the original factory warranty was 36 months 36 000 miles  My transmission failure happened at the 40th month of ownership  I also found out later  I was one of three 1999 Windstars that the local transmission shop was working on for the same problem  The problem is that Ford uses low quality materials to produce their transmissions and the replacement parts of course are of a high quality material  When I saw the pinion gears  they looked like they had over 100 000 miles of wear on them  A design problem that contributed to this is that the transmission is from the Ford Taurus  A transmission designed for a vehicle that weighs 800 lbs  less than the Windstar Reliability  Here is what I had to have worked on since the 3 5 years of ownership  Four times I had to have the power sliding doors repaired because they always popped back open during a hot day  Even today  it still happens from time to time  One time I had to have the cable that closes the driver s side power sliding door be replaced because the cable actually broke  As I said in detail above in the drivetrain section  I had to have the transmission rebuilt  Recently  I had to have the driver s door handle plus internal mechanism replaced because Ford uses plastic parts for this high use area to ensure replacement  Economy  Gas mileage in this vehicle is on par with other mini vans  The EPA rating of 19 city and 23 highway is right on target  Luckily this mini van uses regular unleaded unlike the Honda and Toyota which recommend premium  Gas tank size is a very large 26 gallons for a great cruising range  Insuring this vehicle is similar to all of its competitors  fairly inexpensive Safety  This vehicle has anti lock brakes  front and side air bags  a five star crash rating all around  It was one of the first minivans to obtain this safety rating  Now it s newest competitors from Honda  Toyota and Mazda have the same five star safety ratings  Summary  This mini van can compete easily with its competitors on drivability  handling  comfort and interior features but unfortunately has a poor reliability experience for me  I am very hesitate to recommend this vehicle to anyone because of the reliability issue  It is fine for the family that needs to rent one to use for a special trip but over the long haul  be prepared to pay the price for a Fix Or Repair Daily  FORD  That s how my wife and I have been feeling lately  
Neg, Let me tell you all a story  You can decide for yourself if you would consider purchasing this vehicle from this dealer or any other  I leased my 99 Windstar about a year and a half ago from Freehold Ford in New Jersey  When I picked up the van from the dealer I noticed a large tear in the carpet  How can this be you ask  after all dealers prep is always charged  I don t know  They agreed that it would have to be replaced  and ordered the carpet  I was also missing 1 of the original keys which they told me they had but never produced  so I had to bring the van in so they could make a key  Ok  the new carpet is ready so I bring it in  leave it for 2 days  and then pick it up  When I look at it   the carpet appears to have been installed by a blind man  no offense to the blind  I tell them and now I have to leave it another day to fix that  Well  that s all taken care of  but the sun is out and my wife lowers the visor which then proceeds to drop and dangle as if hanging from a thread  now they order a new visor and when it arrives I have to leave the van another day so they can replace it  A few months go by and I open the rear hatch door which proceeds to fall on my head  It seems that one of the pistons that support the door went bad and had to be replaced  Time to order a new one and another day in the shop  A few more months go by and now the power sliding door doesn t always work  the rear interior light fell out and wont stay put  and the reverse sensors have stopped working  I bring the van back to Freehold Ford once again and leave it for a few days to be repaired  Everything is repaired but they can t find a problem with the door  Now I have it and the door still only operates when it want s to  Some more time goes by and the transmission is now leaking  I bring it back again  They keep it for 5 days and give it back saying it s fixed  but guess what  Still leaks and the door still isn t operating properly  So now back it goes again where they keep it for 4 more days and decide they have to order a new transmission  They will call me when it comes in  That process takes almost 2 months in which while I am waiting  the power steering goes and the interior power door button falls out and won t go back  Yes  finally I have had enough  I go to the manager of Freehold Ford and explain everything that has gone on and tell him I want out of the lease  He tells me that he has to speak to the Ford regional rep  He will get back to me  He then informs me that the rep told him he will not get me out of the lease because these are minor problems and the lemon law does not apply  I also call Ford customer dis service myself and besides being totally useless a few of the reps were so rude I wanted to strangle them  Now the trans  is in  so I leave the van again for 4 days  Current situation is no transmission leak  power steering not operating properly  and the power sliding door still operates whenever it want s to  i called Ford again and was told by the rep to  quot do whatever you feel you have to do quot  I asked the manager of Freehold Ford if I could speak to the rep myself  He said he would call the rep and get back to me  never did even after 3 requests  Now I m not cutting down all Ford products  but I am telling you that Ford and Freehold Ford DO NOT give a damn about their customers  You would think that with ford in the papers and the news every day getting negative press that they would be a little inclined to show the world that the bad publicity isn t all true Decide for yourself     
Neg, We bought this vehicle 6 months ago after the birth of my second child and felt the need for a little more room  I have to admit I bought the car because it looks good  The exterior is beautiful in my opinion and the color choices are many  The downfall is the interior  I m not a leather seat person and the SEL only comes with leather seats  not heated  The dashboard has your typical  quot american car quot  look about it  The rear seat fold down very easily I must say  The ride is smooth but loud as most Fords are  But it serves it s purpose for our family  Room for all and lots of trunk space  I just don t feel we had to spend  30 000 for that     
Neg, The story begins when we rented a 1999 Ford Windstar LX  because our 1998 Nissan Maxima was in the shop for a routine check up  then a mechanic went to park the car and had a 5mph run in with a garage wall  So while the car was getting fixed  the nearby dealership gave us a rental  We had it for a week and loved it  despite all the articles in Consumer Reports telling potential buyers not to buy this vehicle  we had a pleasant time with it  When you get in and drive the vehicle you can t help but notice it s size at 201in  but I am not just talking about its length  I am also talking about the height of this vehicle  66 5in  Those things don t pose a big problem though  because the visibility is great  especially with all the glass and there is tons of head room  The floor pan is low and that makes the Ford Windstar easy to get in and out of  The only thing that disappointed me with this van  was the amount of standard features  The simplest things like a CD player  center console and standard middle captains chairs would have been nice and probably got us to buy a Windstar  but because the lack of standard features for the price  we will just stick with the Maxima  Lastly  if you don t mind paying 30 000 for a van with less standard equipment than a Grand Caravan or Grand Voyager  and having questionable reliability  then the 1999 Ford Windstar is the van for you  
Neg, My 99 Windstar is a great van to haul my family of 5  The exception is a Engine  Spark Knock  noise  I first noticed it at about 7 000 miles  currently at 17 000  I ve been back to the dealer five times now and each time they say it s normal unless the noise is heard during cruising speeds  It rattles at cruising speeds  during accelerations  and  quot whenever it feels like it quot  I ve used all three different gas octanes and I still have the noise  The highest Octane works best but can you imagine my gas expenses for a van rated for 87 Octane  As far as fuel economy goes  19 MPG is all I can get out of my van  The engine noise is most noticeable in hotter weather conditions  The hotter it is  the louder it is  The noise is annoying and I believe will result in major engine repairs in the future as it seems to get progressively worst In my opinion  there is a mechanical flaw but I can t convince the Dealer or Ford of it  I also noticed on this web site that others have indicated an engine noise in their opinions as well br br  
Neg,  L ike the  a href content 51265113732 Geo Chevrolet Metro a  the tiny Ford Aspire has the same ultimate goal in mind  excellent fuel economy between point A to point B transportation  If you buy the Ford Aspire  and  aspire  something from this car other than the fuel saving micro machine that it is  than you are setting yourself up for a unfortunate let down   S ince the Ford Aspire s introduction in 1994 as a replacement for the Festiva  it has come in 2 trim lines  a 2 door hatchback and a 4 door hatchback  my test car  The same 1 3 liter SOHC 4 cylinder engine has been used since introduction  The engine out put remained the same until its last year in  97 at 63 horsepower at 5 000 RPM  and 74 lb ft of torque at 3 000 RPM  Ford offers 2 transmissions for the Aspire  a 3 speed automatic  and a 5 speed manual gear box i Driving Impressions i  Off the line  acceleration  is what you would expect from a car pumping 63 horse power to the front wheels via a 3 speed automatic  very slow  I m sure the standard 5 speed manual transmission would have increased the performance a bit  but we are still talking about a car with 63 horses and a curb weight of around 2 100lbs  so even a 5 speed gear box would not have been the saving grace for this car  At a light  or from a standing start  the Ford Aspire  under full throttle  almost doesn t know what to do  At first the car stalls  as if it is preoccupied looking at the much more intimidating car next to you  then it realize s that the driver needs to move in a hurry and does its best to scoot from the light  Unfortunately  its best  comes in the form of a buzzy exhaust note  tons of engine noise  poor shifting  and acceleration that could match an 18 speed bicycle   Handling  is also not exactly something to write home about  The 13  wheels and the tiny 90 7  wheelbase make this car very skittish over poor road surfaces  and the suspension doesn t help this car achieve any driver confidence while on the twistys   Cruising  in the 1997 Ford Aspire is  to say the most  uninvolving and quite annoying  The 1 3 liter engine  when it finally does reach a freeway speed limit  is still very loud  Wind  road  and engine noise plague the cabin of the car   Braking   despite having a dinosaur set up of disc brakes in the front and drums in the rear  braking was quite good  Braking in the Aspire assured relatively quick emergency stops with little fade   Fuel Economy b  The 1997 Ford Aspire is rated at 34 city 42 highway  yet I observed around 28 city and 32 highway  this significantly lower observed rating is undoubtedly due to the optional 3 speed automatic that was equipped in my tester i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior   unlike the performance of this car is not what you d expect  Despite the tiny size  this car is actually relatively roomy  about the room you d find in a Ford Escort  The Instrument cluster is easy to read  but the dash looks cheap  as does all the materials in this car  Cheap  kids toy like  plastic is what Ford has always loved to use in their economy cars  and the Aspire is no exception  Amenities are far and few  my option list included a 4 speaker cassette player  air conditioning  power steering  and driver   front passenger air bags are standard  The seats are stiff and offer no lumbar supports  but I found them to be relatively comfortable  and superior to the seating in the  a href content 51265113732 Geo Chevrolet Metro a  Front leg room is adequate  but like most compacts the rear is very cramped  The seats in the rear fold down to offer a boat load of cargo room  something I did not expect i Exterior Innovation i  You have no doubt seen the  exterior  of a Ford Aspire  they are almost everywhere on the road  despite being in production for only 4 full years before its demise in 1997  The Body of the Aspire is very oval  almost reminding me of an  egg on wheels  I believe this opinion is shared by many  The wheels are also very small  13  so this exacerbates this unattractive  egg  theme  My test Aspire came with a rear spoiler  and semi sporty hubcaps  I m not sure if this made this car look more  sporty  or made it look more like a mistake   Price   Reliability i  Back in  97 the Ford Aspire ran for around  10 000 12 000  depending on the optional equipment  Today most people who are selling their  97 Ford Aspire s ask for less than  3 000  If you go to a dealer used car lot you can expect to pay around  4 000 or more  These cars have been very reliable over the past 8 years  according to many owners  although I have a sneaky suspicion that these cars will have their share of problems after 100K miles due to the engine constantly working overtime to keep these cars up to speed b Other cars to consider b 1  Hyundai Accent 2  Ford Escort 3  Geo Metro  a href content 51265113732 http www epinions com content 51265113732 a   My Review 4  Pontiac Sunfire 5  Chevrolet Cavalier 6  VW

Neg, I m not a car person  I see a vehicle only as a means to get from point  quot A quot  to point  quot B quot  I don t know about cylinders or  quot x liter engines quot  or anything like that   I don t care  Never have  and probably never will  This is why  several years ago  I was looking at the Ford Escort  It s pretty low price  available in colors I wanted  and had a lot more power than the Honda Civic POS that had spitefully sputtered and died on me on a deserted highway several months before  I had everything worked out   I knew what color I wanted  and I had a down payment ready   I was ready to sign the papers and drive out of the lot in my brand new car  I was probably a little too eager to get a new car  as I had been riding the bus to and from work every day for three months or so  When I discovered that my insurance folks considered the Escort a  quot sports quot  vehicle  and wanted to charge me twice as much per month as the car payments would be  I was crushed  Bitterly  I returned to the car lot to see what else they offered The salesmen  who I m sure was almost as disappointed as I was for not making the sale  pointed me towards Ford s lowest level vehicle  The Aspire As I understand it  the Ford Aspire was only offered in  97  After seeing the vehicle  I could certainly understand why   the Aspire is an ugly vehicle  and I can t imagine how it could have sold enough models to warrant being offered again in  98  Imagine a more rounded Geo Metro       no  wait   imagine an egg  Yes  a giant egg that someone had the morbid sense of humor to fit with tires  skinny little things that are almost impossible to find replacements for when they go flat   I know this from personal experience twice over  It s a tiny car  but I was nevertheless amazed after opening up the hood by how incredibly  minute  the engine was  After spending too many hours groping around my old Honda s engine in the past  cursing every time I couldn t reach a vital bolt because of the cramped space  I sighed pathetically at the thought of trying to navigate around the even tinier engine of the Aspire  In fact  the only big thing about the car is the trunk space  Let me give you an idea how big it is   I m a drummer with a seven piece kit  I can fit the 22 quot  bass drum in the trunk without folding the seat down  and fill the rest of the car with the rest of my drums and hardware  and still drive quite comfortable  despite the fact that  even after two years  I m still a little embarrassed by my  quot Nanoo Nanoo quot  vehicle  After folding down the back seat  over half the space of the car becomes trunk space  Impressive  Another impressive aspect is the gas mileage   the Aspire s flagship feature  I suppose  It has a pathetically small gas tank  8 gallons  but that will take me about 250 miles  I often go 300 miles on a tank on road trips So  if you can get excited about pretty decent gas mileage and a lot of trunk space  and don t mind driving around in a giant chicken egg  go ahead and get this car   it s cheap  Otherwise  don t make the same mistake I made  Shop around and see what else you can get     
Neg,  I ntroduced in 1983 as an  84 model the Tempo was a sales success for many of its 11 years in production  and in its day was quite the proverbial  eye candy  Today most of us frown upon Ford Tempo s  The Ford Tempo has set a negative example for many  once upon a time  American car consumers that now look for cars made overseas  For 1992 The Ford Tempo was available in 3 trim lines  2 different engines  and 2 body styles  the GL  GLS  and LX  all available in either a 2 door sedan or 4 door sedan  In 1997 I was the proud owner of a 1992 Ford Tempo GLS 4 door sedan  The other models came standard with a 96 horsepower 2 3 liter engine  while my GLS came standard with a OHV 3 0 Vulcan V6 that pumped out 135 horsepower at 5 500 RPM  and 150 lb ft of torque at 3 250 RPM  hardly anything to write home about  but compared to the standard engine with the other trim lines  the 3 0 powered Tempo was a real road rocket i Driving Impressions i  Off the line  acceleration  came smooth and relatively quick  even with the clunky 3 speed automatic transmission  a 5 speed manual is standard  The 135 horsepower matched with a sufficient amount of torque reached at a relatively low RPM made it easy getting up to speed  While this engine also came standard in the sluggish 1992 Ford Taurus  the 3 0 in the Tempo allowed for significant improvement in acceleration thanks to the Tempo s much lighter curb weight   Handling  in the Tempo was not much of a joy  While the GLS sported a relatively sporty suspension  the car would take to the turns just like the base models  which was to say the very most   languid and boring  The steering was heavy  and the car felt deprived of any sort of excitement whatsoever   Cruising  was also not the 1992 Ford Tempo GLS s strong points  the car was jolting on bumps  and punishing at high freeway speeds due to wind  road  and engine noise  The 3 speed automatic shifted fine  but at high speeds above 55 MPH the transmission was not geared high enough to give a smooth ride  Hills were taken well  rarely did the car have any troubles tackling hills  but again  only 3 speeds of gears really hurt this car s cruising capabilities   Braking  was only adequate  the brakes never gave me a complete feeling of security while coming to a stop  the front disc  rear drum set up left much to be desired in this department   Fuel Economy  was also not the Ford Tempo s forte  despite only having a 3 0 V6  the 3 speed automatic mated with this engine gave V8 Fuel economy  I received around 18 MPG in the City and and around 22 MPG on the freeway b Performance Gripes b  Where was the 4 speed automatic option  Even the 92 Ford Escort had a 4 speed automatic option  No ABS option  Ford obviously did not have fuel economy  nor handling in mind when they built the Tempo GLS i Interior accommodation Design i  The  interior  of the 1992 Ford Tempo was anything but fancy   Basic  is the best word to describe the cabin of this car  The dash  even in 1991 seemed very dated  and the instrument cluster was also something you d expect to find in a much older vehicle  Amenities were adequate for me  Ac  an AM FM cassette player  power windows and door locks  cruise control  and tilt steering were about as much as you d find in the creature comfort category  The seats were made of cloth  and offered little support  or comfort  no bolstering whatsoever  The  92 Tempo was offered with annoying automatic seat belts that would constantly get jammed  On a positive note  the 1992 Tempo was quite roomy  front and rear leg room were better than many cars  and the trunk offered loads of room for a small car   Reliability issues b  In the 1 year and 40 000 miles that I owned my 1992 Ford Tempo  110 000 total miles  it was plagued with problems  Here is a list of problems I can think of  Boots replaced  fuel injectors replaced  constant wheel allignments  power steering pump went out  transmission developed shifting problems  paint problems  clogged catalytic converters  automatic seat belts would jam up constantly  and the dash board began to crack i Price i  New  the Tempo GLS ran for around  13 000  today  thanks to poor resale value  a GLS can be had for around  3 000 or even less  I have seen them in the paper for as low as  1 200 with the claim that  it runs great   Other 1992 Cars To Consider In Random Order  b i 1  Ford Escort 2  Mazda Protege 3  Honda Civic 4  Honda Accord 5  Chevy Cavalier 6  VW Golf 7  Vw Jetta 8  Toyota Camry 9  Mazda 626 10  Toyota Corolla   Happy car shopping 
Neg, I have a 1992 Ford Tempo  and I wish I didn t  This car is the definition of the word lemon  Everything that can go wrong with a car has gone wrong with this one  I have replaced two starters  the alternator  and all of the hoses  The electrical system has had to be rewired  The power windows only work on rare occaision  The power locks have never worked  The power steering has gone out  twice  The brakes are mushy  The gas mileage is frighteningly low  The service engine light went on the second week I had it  and no matter what I have repaired it never goes off You want more reasons to avoid this car  The jack that comes with it is useless  The windshield wipers stick  The turn signals have a habit of sticking  and not deactivating after you complete the turn  The odometer doesn t work  It leaks oil  It leaks transmission fluid  It makes funny noises  It dies constantly Is there anything good about this car  I like the color  It s a nice bright red In conclusion  I hate this car  The Ford Tempo should be avoided at all cost br br  
Neg, I remember the day my parent s came driving into the drive way with this piece of work  Granted I didn t own a car at this point  but something told me the Tempo was a bad buy To begin with there was no tape player  while this was only a small problem the fact that the speakers were rather cheap and would blow if I attempted to play a song at a loud decibel The basic scheme of the Ford Tempo  in my mind  was to build a cheap car that resembled something sporty  However  along the way they seemed to forget that people have a way of remembering if a car breaks a lot To begin with the electronics that kept track of the fuel  shorted out after about two months  when my parents went to return the car so it could be fixed they were told it would cost in excess of  500 I had heard from a friend of mine that the car was pretty much just a piece of trash that breaks every 15 seconds  but I could not believe this  How could the makers of the Mustang and Thunderbird possibly make a lemon I had decided that the gas gauge was merely bad luck and one of those unexplainable things  but a short while later when the alternator went I began thinking differently  For the record we replaced the alternator three times  and eventually just gave up on the car and bought something else My friend bought a 1988 Escort about a year ago and the transmission and seat belt motors went  and presently my friend Josh has a 1995 Escort that makes strange noises that are suspicious  Perhaps  it s time for Ford to stop trying to bring out new models like the Focus and work on the lesser ones like the Tempo I d give Ford a B  or A  for the Mustang  Thunderbird  and Probe  but a C overall because of the Tempo br br  
Neg, It s a cheap car  good for a  quot first quot  car  but then again maybe not  I bought the car from my sister for  1 000  it is a 1992 Ford Tempo GL  I probably put about a  1 000 into it already  My dad warned me though  quot You get what you pay for  you are going to have to put money in that car  since it is so cheap quot  Well  I sure did  I had it less then a year  and It s been in the shop probably 7 times  New Brakes  Starter  All tie rods  battery  muffler  and a bunch of other little things  that all add up  not to mention a transmission leak  that s been leaking for years  OH  and for the interior problems  Two out of the four windows don t work AT ALL  they neither go up or down  The  quot power locks quot  never work  and the car makes a lot of noises when idle  The ride is pretty rough  and loud  I am currently looking for a new car  hopefully a 1994 Honda Accord  It tells you something when a car like the tempo is recommended 25  of the time  with 2 out of 5 stars  and the Accord is recommended 95  of the time with 5 stars br br  
Neg, This is the first Epinions review I have done for a car  I usually stick to PC games and the like  and it might seem silly to review such an outdated car anyway  But I m sitting here with nothing better to do and some things to get off my chest about this HEAP that I drove for five years  and where better to do it than Epinions  I got my blue  92 Tempo Sedan when I was 17  It was a hand me down from my father  thanks  Dad  that s the best hand me down you gave me since I genetically inherited your asthma  and was already a few years old  Oh  and let me say this right now  I was working very hard to get good grades in a very difficult prep school and did not have the time to get a job and get something better for myself  okay  Let s just clear up this little question before anybody asks it  Some cars are unreliable enough to be annoying  A Tempo is unreliable enough to be DANGEROUS  Things went wrong with the car almost immediately  The automatic seat belts froze in place  permanently  The power locks failed so many times that my Dad just tore in and made them manual locks  saving ninety dollars every three months for new solanoids  The driver s side power window also quit working  Of course  this made going through the drive through at restaurants  or just rolling it down for some fresh air  quite difficult  The only reason it was still POSSIBLE is that Dad glued a metal handle to the top of the window  allowing me a very low tech way to raise and lower it  The car lurched  lunged  and shook while I drove it  It made grinding noises and occasionally made a sound as if a massive sledgehammer was hitting the hood  The transmission  linkage  and suspension on a Tempo are pure garbage  Cheaply made  and shoddily assembled  The air conditioner broke on at least three occasions  The guy who fixed it on the second time pulled off the button panel to find that the plastic on the other side was melted  and that I was lucky the car had not caught fire  Tempos do that  you know  They catch fire  And they burn  At least the brakes worked  If they hadn t  I might have been killed ten times over by now  I am over six feet tall  and this car was so cramped I could barely squeeze into it  My head touched the ceiling  It was like trying to drive a clown car  The paint came off of the roof in large patches  It didn t chip  but sort of  faded  away to reveal the primer  Luckily  a Tempo can t get any uglier no matter what color s  it is  I never expected much from this car  Just a means of conveyance  and one in which I could have some SEMBLANCE of trust and reliability  I didn t even get that  Hey  at least I had absolutely NOTHING to worry about as far as car thieves were concerned  A thief would have taken one look at my car and kept right on walking  unless he had some giant stack of fifteen foot by twenty foot typing paper that he needed a weight for  When  Old Blue   as I liked to call it sometimes  other things I called it can t be written here as these reviews are censored  finally died  I was 20 and working a summer job between college semesters  The transmission bled out  leaving a trail of fluid in the car s wake  I got in and started her up  but the car wouldn t move  I inherited my Mom s Buick Century  infinitely better car  after she got a new Regal  There was just the question of what to do with the Tempo  I wanted to push it into the Ohio River or maybe take it to a gun range and shoot at it  but my dad decided to have it towed away and repaired  He unloaded it on some chump for five hundred bucks  I still think Dad won on the deal  and I haven t seen it since  So ends the saga of my first and last Ford car  I am man enough to admit that  on occasion  this car terrified me  I feared for my life when driving this car  I did not take it on freeways for fear that it would malfunction at 65 miles an hour and kill me  My father used to say things like   You should be grateful for this car  because you didn t have to work a day of your life to get it  In my day  blah blah blah  Yeah  Dad  WHATEVER  He could have afforded to get me a new Toyota or Honda  but instead insisted on giving me this PIECE OF SH  to  I suppose   Teach me the value of a dollar  or whatever  It was a lesson that could have killed me  I saw that most other guys in the high school parking lot had nicer cars than mine  Not because they had jobs  but because their fathers weren t TIGHTWADS  I felt jealous and underprivileged  I m not much for wrap ups where grades aren t concerned  so  THE END PS  If you are a parent  you owe your kid better than a Ford Tempo for his her first car  Ask yourself if it s better to  teach your kid the value of a buck  while putting his her life in danger  or to get the kid a Honda Civic so he she can LEARN TO DRIVE A DAM  CAR WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HAVING TO FIX IT EVERY THREE WEEKS  SEE WHAT YOU COME UP WITH  Okay  I m finally done  
Neg, This was my first car  I got it the day I got my drivers license  It was used  but it seemed like a good deal  And not to say anything too bad about it  this car served its purpose and got me around safely throughout high school and my first year at college  However it is really not that terrific of a vehicle  and it has some problems along with its good points First of all the alignment is off   completely  Once when I got the tires rotated the servicer told me that there was no use in balancing them  they would just be unaligned the second i drove over a bump  And he was right  the wheels never failed to unalign themselves quickly  This caused the tires to wear unevenly  and it was annoying having to pull the steering wheel 20 degrees to the right to get the car to go straight Also the paint job on this car was pretty awful  Every time I would dry the car after washing it my towels would be completely red  Also the black paint around the windows on my car chipped off   and every other tempo I have seen has this same problem Lastly the speakers were pretty bad  one of them buzzed continuously whenever any base was turned on  I did have a great time in this car  It was a fun and great to drive around my small town  but it is not a powerful vehicle  and it does not handle very well  I would not reccomend buying one of these used vehicles  My old one now sits in a car graveyard after busting a rod through the engine  Check out my review of the Mitsubishi Mirage to see how much happier I am now br br  
Neg, We bought a used 1995 Ford Aerostar in 1998  Our initial reason for buying the van was that we have 4 children  2 of which are still in car seats  With a family that size  our options were very limited Initially we were pleased because with the 2 bench seats as well as the 2 front seats  it is a 7 passenger vehicle  which made it roomy enough for our crowd  Even with the 2 car seats  there was still plenty of room for the other 2 older boys to sit comfortably without being squished  And during road trips our boys could get comfortable  lay their head on a pillow positioned over the arm rest and go to sleep while still buckled securely into their seats  Also  since we had the extended cargo area van  there was plenty of room for hauling  whether it was the futon bed we bought for our toddler when it came time for him to move from the crib  or the computer desk  or all our luggage when driving from California to D  C  Roominess was never a problem with this van What was a problem was lousy gas mileage  Another problem was the frequent problems with the front end alignment  It seemed to never stayed aligned  regardless of how excellent a condition the roads were in  Also the van drives very heavily  What I mean by this is that when going around curves or making a turn  it leans on it s side and makes you feel like you are going to tip over  True  this vehicle is built like a tank  and if it did tip over  we d probably be safe  But I m not willing to take that chance  Also  the manuverability for changing lanes  pulling into parking spaces or any of the other simplist driving tasks  is terrible  The simplists tasks become major chores in this van  And the fact that it squeeks and rattles and makes a lot of noise doesn t make matters any better Also  I have to admit that I did not like the air conditioning vents for the back  They did not cool  or heat  the back area of the van very well  Even the children in the bench seat closest to the front of the van were often either not warm enough or not cool enough Also  on the driver s side in the passenger area  there are some controls for the stereo  While this may seem a good idea for some  it was a source of constant annoyance for us  The children loved to play with the buttons and were constantly changing the radio station I can give this van one more bit of praise  For those of you out there that have a large family and are frequently taking road trips  the bench seats in the van can be taken out easily  and rearranged  We had the big bench in front at some points  at other points it was the small bench in front  But the arrangement that we used the most often and was what the children seemed to enjoy the most was when we had the front bench face backwards so that on road trips the children could be buckled in securely  and yet still interact with each other and share toys back and forth And finally  one last warning  During the 1 1 2 yrs we had this van we constantly had mechanical problems with it  Also  since the front end alignment was frequently off  the tires wore down unevenly very quickly and had to be replaced more quickly then they would have been otherwise br br  
Neg, My father owns a 1991 Ford Econoline van and it the biggest piece of junk he has ever owend  The van rides well but it only has a 302 V8 and does not any power whatsoever  It has a spacious interior and alot of room but that is the only good thing I can say about it  The van averages only 13 mpg  you cannot see out of the rearview mirror and it has no acceleration and you cannot keep the front end aligned  This is not a good vehicle to buy in general  I cannot recommend this van to anyone  it is nothing but a 7000 lb  gas hog  That is my opinion on the Ford Econoline van br br  
Neg, I finally took a close look at a Ford Expedition I ve been a 4x4 owner since the sixties everything from CJ5 Jeeps to Ramchargers to Broncos  I had the feeling from afar that this new Ford rig was not like anything I was used to I was right It drives like a big heavy station wagon  with a slightly stiffer suspension than would have been found in the big wagons of the 60 s and 70 s  Handling was fair   but the old Bronco has it beat in terms of predictability on bumpy turns  Loaded heavily  the Expedition has a tendency to develop rear end sway and instability at highway speeds  It did NOT feel like a truck at all   and of course  that s Ford s intent  The interior was impressive   all kinds of little gadgets  rear air  etc  etc  The seats were comfy  the driving position good  For forty grand or so  it should be fancy When you look at the front suspension  you know immediately why it rides as it does struts  CV joints  torsion bars it s a car suspension  not really for trucks  That s OK for the average owner who has gotten one because he or she needs a big  tall station wagon with 4 wheel drive  This machine will NOT do well off road in really nasty conditions  It s obviously not intended to Raise the hood and you see a backyard mechanics nightmare  If you like to work on your own machine   say  to change the plugs once in a while  do oil changes and the like   you will not enjoy this machine  Half the engine is up under the firewall cowl  Change the plugs  Not from the top  you won t  But if you can afford one of these  you can afford to have it worked on and cost of doing a job under the hood will be high   lots of stuff in the way and lousy access means longer times for various maintenance tasks I don t like the Expedition at all  Looks great  drives OK  nice interior appointments   fine for anyone who is not a 4x4 purist  But if  like me  you want something you can fix in a pinch and take anywhere  then this ain t the rig for you br br  
Neg, Things have simply gone too far I have long supported the SUV craze  No I do not desire one myself but I believe in life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness  If an individual so desires one of these lumbering Goliath s known as THE FORD EXPIDITION  Who am I to question their decision  I am but a humble boy who drives a fuel efficient Civic I must now take a stand  I must now declare that I was wrong in my support for I have only egged on the boggling dimensions of the SUV engineering philosophy  I must now rise up and denounce all the soccer moms and all the weekend warriors  I must rip apart my misguided goodwill and throw it to the side  Things have simply gone too far This morning  driving to work  I  well  I er   How to put this delicately  I saw a midget driving a Ford Expedition This Fellini esque circumstance freaked my world if you know what I m saying I am six four  Tall by some standards  average size by these bean stalk kids I see sacking my groceries in the stores  Despite my lanky stature I have always driven small  compact  decent minded cars  It has not been a decision of preference but rather one of economy  Why would I want a monster to guzzle up all my hard earned dollars on gas when I can blow them on beer  video games  and CD s I have long been content to tour around town in a minuscule ill endowed boy vehicle  I have justified the Suburbans lumbering along beside my trusty old Civic with its dead head sticker happily advertising my social demeanor from the rear window  as cars of practicality for some  You see I have no children  I do not coach a soccer team  and my bikes can easily be hung on a trunk mount for my one weekend warrior exercise I called my Dad  The not so proud owner of a Jeep SUV  and informed him of the horror I witnessed this morning  I heard him say   Hey Cathy  My son just saw a midget driving an Expedition  to another worker in his office  Then I heard laughter This was no laughing manner You see these misinformed people knew not of the psychological scars I had borne this frail morning  I was sitting in wall to wall traffic listening to my favorite morning talk show  I was laughing along with the jokes and feeling a bit peckish from not eating the night before when all of the sudden I felt the Earth move  The sudden quake of the soil beneath me meant only one thing  There was an SUV approaching I looked up to see the driver of the vehicle  I love kids so I was expecting to see a weary mother driving her three kids to day care  It s always a pleasure to see a group of rambunctious kids horse playing in the back of an SUV or mini van  With a smile upon my face I girded my expectations for such a sight  Then the Expedition drove up and inside sat one solitary  little person Do not read me wrong  I have nothing against dwarfs or midgets  I have received much contention on this site in the past for my review of Austin Powers II  I called Mini me a midget and I received hate mail from a person of little stature saying that he was in fact a dwarf  Not to argue semantics but I have always heard people with the unfortunate condition called midgets so I m sorry if I offend anyone out there I was more disturbed by the sheer ludicraceness of the whole event  Here was a person that needed a fourth of the amount of room as myself driving a car that was four times as big as my own  Did they have children  did they coach soccer or baseball  why did they buy this mistake of a vehicle  I was boggled beyond simple mundane ordinary confusion  I felt the juice I had ingested earlier that morning swelling up in my stomach and my ulcer began to throb The Ford Expedition gets twelve count em twelve miles to the gallon  My former boss owned a Suburban and he said it cost him fifty bucks to fill up his tank  How much would it cost to fill up one of these My wife and I rented an SUV for our honeymoon  A Rodeo  It was a small SUV  As we drove across Death Valley I would say to my wife   Here s a gas station we d better fill up She would look at me in confusion and say   Why we just filled up thirty miles ago  Then in understanding she would pause a moment  look down at the dash realizing the monstrosity of the vehicle encasing her and say  Oh yeah  we ll stop here I have to pee anyway When shopping for an SUV please do not consider size  When the Ford Expedition came out it was test marketed in the Dallas area  The news crews were interviewing people about it  I remember clearly one lone man stating  when asked if he would buy the boat   Yes  I like it  It s big For those of you who feel the need to drive around in a monster  raise the wheels on your truck  take the muffler out of your Pinto so that at least it sound big  Please do not purchase a Ford Expedition  They are unsafe  scary to little cars  and impractical  Buy a semi instead  I m at least used to those I do not think a midget wearing a suit and driving an eighteen wheeler would cause me such mental distress br br  
Neg, What is white  not black  and red all over  ME  After being struck head on in a collision while driving at least 35 mph  I  Klaxonman  a Caucasian male  became red all over   Red from blood  There is absolutely no need for such large vehicles  they only spell trouble  While the driver of these cars may be safe  are the people driving the sedans  No  Not at all  I suffered at least three broken bones in my rib cage  and I lost quite a bit of blood from cuts due to shattered glass  Had a smaller vehicle hit me head on  the result may have been a bit different  Another poor aspect of such large SUV s is the fact that they are gas guzzlers  Virtually any sedan will get mileage that is twice as efficient as the Expedition  That will cut your gas bills two fold What I am trying to say is  don t just think about yourself when purchasing such a large vehicle  think of the other drivers on the road  While this review may not relate to the specific car  I hope this may sway your decision of purchasing a tank of a car  Do you need a lot of room in your car  Try a mini van  Having trouble handling in rugged terrain  There are plenty of 4 wheel drive vehicles which come at a much lower price and a much smaller size  Before you decide to purchase the expedition  just think of these two points  1  Large SUV s are much more dangerous to other drivers than sedans 2  You will be saving a lot of money in purchasing a smaller vehicle With that said  what advantages that the Expedition may have can outweigh the disadvantages of purchasing of such a large car  I think the choice is easy br br  
Neg, Expedition into vanity  selfishness  and irresponsibility I realize that this may not be the forum for such a discussion  but I know some people about to buy an SUV will read this  and I am curious about what they think  Are SUV s a guilty pleasure  or a bit irresponsible  These days in America  capitalism and consumerism are the twin gods that no one dares blaspheme  and the auto market is perhaps the arena where these gods exert the most influence  We love dogs  dogs love trucks  we love trucks  I understand that for many many people  an SUV is a sensible purchase  However  going off road is becoming more and more rare as there becomes more and more road and therefore less and less off road  From what I have seen  the bumpiest road that a majority of SUV s see is a gravel driveway  But why do I care  live and let live  right Not really  First of all  because SUV s are bigger and bigger  it becomes less and less safe to own a small car  I mean  a Ford Expedition could run over one of those Ford Festivas and not even know it  This is an alarming trend  The first Jeeps managed to be hardy without being Hummers  but others don t seem to think this is possible  Secondly  and I am no eco terrorist here  but the gas mileage thing does seem a bit short sighted  Thirdly  the sheer tonage of an Expedition does a lot more damage to city and suburban roads than a smaller car would In conclusion  it seems to me that a lot of the reason many people buy SUV s is simply vanity  Cars once had vanity plates and now are becoming big packages of vanity themselves  I realize that often the American dream is measured in terms of how many cars fit in your garage  Living in a city  and near decent public transportation  I have managed to live without a car for my whole life  However  I can t help it  I lust after them daily  But as much as I mull it over  even if I had the money for it  an SUV just seems a bit wrong  And yet now everyone makes an SUV because the market for them is just that big  Isn t it great that we have all this money  Isn t it lovely that our country is at peace and has been for years Isn t it fantastic that we can write  talk and exchange opinions with people all over the globe Isn t it about time we started caring for someone besides ourselves Please feel free to correct me  but it seems that SUV s are a symptom of a larger problem  I don t mean to condemn anyone  I am just curious about the real causes behind this disturbing trend br br  
Neg, Be ready to spend lot s of   with Today s Gas Prices  This vehicle is definitely a REAL GAS GUZZLER  Just don t know how long I can afford to keep it  Several things drove me to purchase my 2000 Eddie Bauer Ford Expedition  It definitely offers spacious comfort  this is definitely a plus  My kids have really enjoyed the ability of having rear CONTROL of the MUSIC and the A C  Personally  I like the built in earphone jacks that the rear offers and they do use them  Only kids with their short legs can really enjoy the 3rd seat  The 3rd seat is O K  for now with kids  that is  However  third seat definitely not for adults  With two different drivers in my household for this same vehicle  I have really enjoyed the feature that allows you to pre set the adjustments of the seats  mirrors  gas  amp  brake pedals using the key remote  this I REALLY like  At first I really had a concern as to whether  I  a 4 11 quot  woman  could really handle driving a vehicle this size  With the handy step up boards and hand grips  getting on or off is not a problem at all  I was also concerned about turns and parking  again not a problem at all  OVER ALL  it is really pretty smooth to drive and handles well  With it s size I feel a great sense of safety  although an impact is an impact  I just feel it would be a bit different in comparison to the size vehicle I previously drove  It also feels great to drive up high We took our first out of town trip in it last month  I have only had it 60 days at that time  I must say  it s definitely much better mileage on long distance travel  The one thing we really did not prepare for was the lack of luggage space  Yes  it does have an above exterior luggage rack  however  we found out at the stops along the way  we had to try to park where our vehicle would be within view  because of our luggage  even though it was tied down and pretty secured  we still felt unsure of leaving it out of sight AGAIN  THIS VEHICLE IS JUST SUCH A GAS GUZZLER  I JUST DON T KNOW HOW LONG I CAN AFFORD TO KEEP IT br br  
Neg, I recently rented a 2000 Ford Expedition for a weekend outing  and to road test the vehicle  There are alot of pros and cons with this SUV  I currently own a 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe  and have not one complaint regarding the vehicle so far  it has went everywhere that I ve decided to take it  and not once has it skipped a beat in doing so  I rented this Expedition to compare it to the Tahoe  Well  there is no comparison  the Tahoe wins hands down for certain  The Expedition got an average of 11 miles per gallon throughout the whole trip  which was 3 consecutive days  I got it stuck in the mud 4 different times  which required a tow out of the mud each time  it handles terribly on and off road  and seems to me that it is underpowered for it s size  The Tahoe  on the otherhand  handles very well for a SUV  will literally smoke the tires on dry pavement  and gets anywhere from 15 mpg to 22 mpg  Do not get me wrong  the Expedition is a very comfortable  nice riding  luxurious SUV  and does have an abundance of qualities that alot of other automakers simply do not think of when manfacturing thier SUV s  I feel that the Expedition is suitable for the buisness executive type of consumer  that needs the four wheel drive occasionally  maybe to get to his her office in the snow safely  and get there in ultimate comfort  This vehicle is not made for the serious 4x4 nuts at all  it s simply not designed to go off road too far  and if you do  you d better have someone following you with a long tow rope br br  
Neg, 1997 was the year that we leased the Expedition from Kearny Mesa Ford  and to say the least  that was the beginning of our NIGHTMARE  We got the Red Carpet Lease  whatever the heck that means  for 2 years and 15K Miles per year  We got the vehicle September 14th and we were so excited since its been a while since we got a new vehicle  much less an SUV  The next day  me and my family when to church and was on our way home and all of a sudden  the truck made this weird sound  We thought it was the air conditioning  so we turned that off  It continued to make that irritating noise  so my husband decided to pull over to the side of the freeway  That s it  The whole truck died on us  so we had to call a towing service and had it returned to the dealership  That whole incident freaked me out to say the least  After only one day of having the truck  the next day it s back in the shop  At that point  we called the dealership and told them that we no longer wanted the TRUCK  And the dealership said quot Sorry No Can DO quot  To make the long story short  we got stuck with that  598 00 per month lease but we are done with it and do you think I will recommend their dealership to anyone after they screwed us BIG TIME NO WAY And also  they should consider redesigning the front passenger seats it s way too uncomfortable br br  
Neg, The Expedition is seen as Ford s response to the GMC Suburban  I must say that I prefer the Suburban to the Expedition which merely seems to be a larger version of the Explorer  The Suburban was the original oversized SUV and Ford tried to imitate it  I think that the Expedition is too big  Bigger isn t always better  For one thing  it is hard to drive the Expedition on narrow roads because it is so wide  You can t park in tight parking spots for the same reason  It isn t good for hauling things when it is full because there isn t enough trunk space  the seats are uncomfortable and cramped  and it is built poorly  I had neighbors who owned the Expedition and they had to take it to the shop quite frequently because of one problem or another  The gas mileage isn t that great either  That thing is a gas guzzler  The Expedition seems like a ploy to sell vehicles by riding the SUV craze  In my opinion  you would be better off avoiding it br br  
Neg, Is that a truck or a tank  Its an ok car for a big family  but has no room in the trunk for anything  Its a very tiny space  Also  the gas bill is very high because it has a really big tank to fill the gass  There are good things to the car though  It has a lot of room for the children and yourself  Another  thing is that its a high up car if u like to be high up  The bad thing is though that it is a very big car and can put smaller cars in danger if the get in an accident  Make sure you make a really good decision before you buy the car     
Neg, What a terrible vehicle for such a price  This vehicle had nothing  but flaws and defects  It came delivered with dry ball joints  a twisted brake line  defective door gaskets  a bad door latch  rattles in the dashboard  It was in the shop more times than not and the service department could never fix it right  They were only good at making excuses for it  Then of course  the truck gained a terrible vibration at 46K miles that couldn t be resolved  either  The tranny became noisy at 10K miles  The 4 6L motor is truly an embarassment  significantly underpowered  This vehicle couldn t even climb some highway inclines without downshifting and significantly winding out the engine  Who would ever have thought that someday one would have to pay  30K or more for a Ford     
Neg, I have to begin with a disclaimer  there is no listing for the Ford Escort prior to 1992  There was a Mazda Ford integration in 1991 and all models beyond this date had significant changes in body style as well as engine specifications so some of the claims I make on this vehicle may not be valid on current models Please do not rate me down for off topic  I am not very auto literate  This epinion is part of a write off dedicated to roadiem  an advisor in autos as well as a gifted writer  someone who cared about others regardless of whether he knew them or not and who recently passed  I would politely ask that if you have the urge to rate down for this reason then please don t rate it at all  Any earnings from this post are for the family of roadiem I happen to own an Escort GT  I sometimes wish I did not own this vehicle but I don t seem to be able to part with it  I use it to travel back and forth from work and the drive from the Boise  Idaho area to the Portland  Oregon area  Primarily for the gas mileage  especially with the most recent ridiculous gas prices  I recently went to the greater Portland area to visit my oldest daughter for a week end  My gas mileage was about 35 MPG  I had no mechanical or electrical problems  This ugly little car is eleven years old with 112 00 miles on it  I find the convenience to be traveling about four hundred miles on about  15 00 more important than how I look This model was designed and produced before the acquisition of Mazda by Ford  It is the last year that the Escort was still fairly boxy in body style and attempted to be a  sports car  It is in fact rated a  sports car  for insurance purposes primarily  I was told  because it is a three door or hatchback model  Ford also attempted to give it a sporty look by adding a pinstripe decal  tail scoop and  low profile  tires but I see no justification in labeling any car with a 4 cylinder engine as a  sports car And the low profile tires are far more expensive than standard tires  Every time I look at it I have to fight the urge to peel the pin striping off Let me tell you what I do know about the internal workings of my beasty sports car  The engine is a 1 9 litre with fuel injected cams  I have no idea what the 1 9 litre spec is saying other than engine size but I understand the fuel injected part versus carburetor function so I can say something about that  I have never had to have the injectors serviced but I do add cleaners to my gas tank every three or four months  And I don t allow the gas tank to empty farther than 1 4 tank to avoid pulling  stuff  off the bottom  I am certain this is good for any car s fuel delivery system I have already stated that the engine was 4 cylinder and the big disadvantage in this is it makes for a gutless ascention to higher speeds ESPECIALLY on any incline  Gearing down can help but it is just a good idea to enter the slower lane if traveling a one lane highway when passing lanes are provided  If there has not been a passing lane for several miles and the grade has been somewhat inclined you should be able to easily spot a three mile chain of ticked off fellow motorists driving on your back bumper  It is just safer to get out of their way and look sheepish as they pass  You will be disadvantaged in an Escort if you have a need for speed  Declines are a different story and if you are like me by the time you have entered a declined grade you will be ready for a speed increase  Control this urge within reason or you may have to explain to an officer as I did the reason you are doing 87 mph in a 65 mph zone after completing an easterly ascent into the Blue Mountains which is about a 6 mile  6  grade incline  My best explanation is I had to begin my ascent at 120 mph just to reach the top on the same day and I was just beginning to slow down Mr  Officer was not amused but did warn me that there were patrol cars hidden about every two miles for the rest of the mountains  about 30 miles  and at those speeds I could easily have to file bankruptcy by the time I reached the end of the mountain pass  So I spent the rest of the day chugging through The choke is electric and apparently suffers brain freeze if exposed to lower than freezing temperatures longer than 49 seconds  The engine does stall but once it has started stalling you can get another 50 miles or so before it refuses to run altogether  I do not travel long distance in this vehicle during the winter months  The opposing weather condition of prolonged extreme heat can result in  vapor lock  which also temporarily disables all engine functions so long travels are only smooth in moderate temperatures  While on the subject of fuel one should know that the fuel pump here is a self propelling unit actually in the gas tank and within a year of owning the car I could hear it and I am certain anyone within twenty feet can hear it as well  It is lessened by a fuller tank giving less space for the echo effect of the closed tank  This can be very annoying  My solution is to turn up the music  The stock stereo cassette player is your basic run of the mill music provider  I am not knowledgable on these systems so I won t attempt to appear that way  If I can hear the music and the words are legible I am satisfied I have had no other troubles with this vehicle engine wise except I had to replace the water pump twice so far and the alternator once  I do think that is pretty minimal for a car of eleven years  I do wonder why the clutch has held up through all these miles because this is a common source of problems with most Ford compact cars So now I will tell you about the crawl space disguised as the interior  The color scheme is pretty boring  Gray on gray  If you are in the drivers seat it does feel like the steering wheel is attempting to rest on your chest and your wearing a waist down body cast  The back support is good and I rarely have a back ache even after long drives  If you don t begin your journey with an intimate friend you may be that way at the end of the trip as there is maybe 4 inches between the driver and passenger seats in the front The back seats are actually roomier than the front ones if you don t count leg room and the two seats will collapse forward to make a larger trunk  They also collapse independently if you only want half of the trunk larger Seat belts are in abundance with shoulder harness provided in the back seats and the annoying automatic shoulder harness in the front seats which generally scare your passenger if they are not used to them  These are very noisy and no amount of WD 40 decreases this  The driver harness jammed in the closed position a long time ago so I do not have to contend with it  The other problem with automatic shoulder belts is that it makes it hard to remember your lap belt which is not automatic The dash panel is easily accessible mostly because you are sitting on it  Standard Ford issue with A C included in the GT package  No extra or flashy details except the idiot light suggesting when to shift  It is my opinion that if one cannot shift by engine sound or read the magical tachometer then one should probably aspire to an automatic vehicle  I tilt the steering wheel at an angle that blocks this light from my view because I find it annoying  I also wish the engine warning display included an oil pressure display  I asked a Ford mechanic about this once and was told that if the oil can with a slashed circle illuminates on my dashboard then it is probable the block is already cracked  What the point is I don t know  I just make it a point to monitor my oil level  This car does not burn oil even now  economically a plus Here is my one and only epinion on an auto  I chose to write about this auto because it is the one I know the best  We also have a full size GMC Sierra  a Chevrolet S 10 king cab and a Mercury Villager mini van  Obviously there is a clash of opinion for vehicle manufacturer choice I have pretty much stayed true to Ford for most of my life  I suspect this is a subliminal choice as my high school boyfriend had a cherry 65  mustang and it was the envy of the school  I have taken a lot of crap throughout the years  especially from my GM mate  I just remind him that the paint is not peeling off of any of my chosen vehicles and the cost to us when his fuel delivery system crashed last winter     964 00  In closing I would like to say if you are looking for a dependable commuting vehicle with good gas mileage and fair to average comfort with below average repairs and low maintenance you may want to consider an Escort  Remember this is an epinion on a pre 1991 model  after that everything changed and I know nothing about that except I think the newer model Escorts resemble the Mazda 626  This car is not for the vain or the self conscious sort  I am old enough not to care  and I have more money for other things in the long run  The van is for family accommodations and the trucks are because apparently real men drive trucks    The Sierra has a lift kit on it  I get in it with a rope ladder   If you are looking for durability  low maintenance and good gas mileage then I can recommend this vehicle for these purposes  Would I buy it again  I don t know  when I bought it eleven years ago it was the best buy I could make with the resources I had available at that time  I don t really think it would have been my first choice if finances had been different for me then  But I have few regrets and it has certainly been a true blue friend to me for the most part Thank you for reading this post  it is my first participation in a write off  The irony in this is that when I first started writing at epinions I was curious about what these write offs were  The person that I posed this question to was roadiem and his response was prompt and encouraging to join in on one  He also had comforting and supportive comments to my postings about my struggles with my eldest daughter in the past  I did not know roadiem but it was easy enough to ascertain that he was extremely devoted to his family   friends and mankind  and womankind  in general  I am saddened to hear of his passing and offer prayer for the family  My deepest sympathies to any and all affected by his journey s end on earth  I am certain he will rise to the occasion of the next journey before him Others participating in this write off for roadiem are bjcuevas  naphtalia  seether166  sherrylee  mattjoe viper1963  gollygumdrops  noniaBidnis  nightshade 01 obnox

Neg, I requested Budget Rent a Car for a Toyota Tercel during my 5 days in Illinois and Indiana recently  but instead  ended up with a green  2000 Ford Escort 4 door with 4000 miles on the odometer  I was somewhat excited because this was like test driving a brand new car  a feat I don t perform very often  Furthermore  the test drive was going to last the whole weekend b Basic Features  Except for the automatic transmission and air conditioning  the Escort I drove was barebones  That means roll up window  manual door locks  and levers and knobs to adjust the seats  no electrical assistance  The car came with an AM FM radio with cassette  which helped during my daily 3 4 hours drive from Monticello to Indianapolis and back  I had to pull the antenna out manually  keeping with the barebones spirit of the car b Interior  It took a while to get used to the seats  as I had to make several adjustments to make myself somewhat comfortable  The seats can move back  amp  forth by the lever under the front of it  and the upper portion can tilt forward and back with a rotating knob on the left  a standard way to adjust seats on most cars  I felt that the seat bottom could have used more cushion  as it is not tiltable and I didn t get enough support on my thighs  leading my hips to hurt the first 2 days of driving   I cured this by taking my shoes off while driving which lowered my legs  There was no remote adjust on either outside mirrors  which was just a minor inconvenience since I only had to adjust them once  The gauges on the car were very Spartan  with 120 mph speedometer odometer  fuel gauge  temperature gauge  and warning lights  but no tachometer or oil pressure gauge  One nice feature was remote trunk opener  a yellow button underneath the steering wheel b Engine Transmission  The Escort s Overhead Cam  OHC  2 0 liter engine had a lot of spunk  as I was able to drive 70 85 mph without stressing the engine  I didn t floor the accelerator much during the entire 5 days  The engine noise  however  was somewhat annoying  sort of a choked buzzing noise that is common with both GM  amp  Ford s 4 cylinder cars  If I wanted this much noise  then I d want the engine to sound throaty  not choked  Most 4 cylinder engines in Japanese or European cars feel smoother and quieter than the Escort  Furthermore  my 3 cylinder 1985 Chevy Sprint  with 110 000  miles  seems smoother and quieter The 4 speed automatic transmission  with OverDrive  was actually pretty good  with solid shifting and timely downshifting when I passed other cars  A Toyota smooth transmission would not fit well with this car  as it would contrast too much with the buzzy engine  In a way  I was happy with this  quot quasi sportiness quot  as I always knew which gear the car was in just by listening to the engine and keeping track of the distinct shifts b Driving  The steering on the Escort was actually very good  as it had good feedback and pointed the car where I steered  even though it s power steering   it felt more to me like it was  quot power assisted quot  I was greeted with thunderstorms every morning  but the Escort felt just as solid in the rain and I felt very comfortable driving it 65 70 mph The gas mileage of the Escort was actually very good  at about 36 mpg  9 4 gallons per 340 miles  This included a little stop  amp  go driving to fight traffic around Indianapolis Speedway b Overall Impression  The Ford Escort seems like a pretty good value for the money  with usable horsepower  solid handling  and great gas mileage  The car s styling is somewhat generic  and there are enough minor annoyances like difficult to adjust seats and engine noise to remind you that this is a  quot starter quot  car suited for students and budget buyers  With the Ford Focus and Toyota Echo in the marketplace now  it d be tough for me to recommend the Escort as a new car purchase  However  time will tell if the Escort will become a reliable used car  in which case I would highly recommended it for use as an inexpensive commute car like the Chevrolet Sprint I drive     
Neg, In 1992  I bought my first car  and it was a 1981 Ford Escort  I just wanted a little car to drive around town  get groceries  take my son to the doctor  etc  without having to rely on public transportation  It was a little rough around the edges   it needed a new muffler and brakes  but other than that  it was fine It was a standard transmission  and since I had never driven one before  I had to teach myself how to drive it  It wasn t that hard  and soon  I was driving it  in my opinion  like I had been driving a stick shift for years  I only had it for a few months  and then gave it to my father when I got married  My husband had a car  and my father needed a car  so I gave him mine  Sadly  though  the little Escort only lasted through one more cold  Canadian winter  before my father sold it for junk  All in all  I didn t have too many problems with this car  but it was 11 years old when I got it  so it had been through it s good times  If I had to get another older car   I wouldn t get a car that s 12 years old   I would consider getting a 5 or 6 year old Escort  It was great on gas  very economical  and an okay first car br br  
Neg, I have owned to Ford Escort s in my life  I bought these because they were older models and very cheap  I soon found out why they were so cheap  I used my first Escort  an 85 model  to commute over 60 miles to work  I found it to be very easy to drive and extremely comfortable  The problem was  that the clutch disk wore out on it  Being a front wheel drive vehicle the repairs cost over  600 on a  30 part  Most people prefer not to drive a standard anyway  so this won t matter to you  My biggest piece of advice for this car is DON T BUY A STANDARD  The repairs are extremely difficult for the home mechanic and extremely high in a shop  Secondly  I have found that the smaller 1 6 liter engine is far more fuel effecient and reliable than it s 1 9 liter counterpart  The difference in power between these two engines is practically unnoticeable  All in all a decent car  just make sure you don t pay too much br br  
Neg, In January of 1999 I bought a brand new 1999 Ford Ranger Extended Cab with the  quot Sport quot  package  The total cost of the vehicle was around  18 000  This meant that it did not have CD  auto locks  auto windows  etc  It was is just a  quot bare bones quot  truck  It did  however  come with a free 24 hour roadside service package and a  1 000 rebate The first thing that I noticed about this vehicle is that it isn t designed for people of slightly above average height  Being 6 2 quot  my field of view is very limited  and the vehicle is sort of cramped  But  it was all that I could afford Almost immediately  my truck began to malfunction  I took it to a nearby dealer for an inspection  Since I didn t buy the truck from their dealership  they didn t act as if they cared to help me with my problem  And  when I finally did get them to look at it  they said that nothing was wrong with it My main concern was  quot power surges quot  that caused my lights  radio  etc  to go on and off in a sort of  quot flicker quot  fashion  After 3 tries of trying to get is looked at  I was told that nothing was wrong this coming from the Ford mechanics Shortly after that  me and my father were almost killed due to their mis diagnosis  The power system totally shut down while I was on a dangerous strip of highly trafficed road  Barely able to coast off the road  I was sure that we were going to die Thanks to the roadside service  I was able to take the truck to the dealership  They then admitted that there was a glitch and replaced the broken part with a used part  quot remanufactured quot  is the term they used When I complained about them replacing the part with a used one  they stated that it was Ford policy to replace electrical parts with used ones  And  I was told that Ford no longer makes that electrical part so the only parts on the market are used When I inquired as to whether my NEW truck had come with used parts  I was put aside  My question was never answered  Neither was a direct inquiry to Ford ever answered Now  my multi functional switch is broken  So  every time that I try to make a turn my wipers come on  But  since it takes 45 minutes to 2 hours to even talk to a customer service rep from Ford I have yet to get it fixed Trust me  my next truck WILL NOT be a Ford  Ford Tough give me a break br br  
Neg, I bought the cheapest American made I m a patriot  so sue me  truck I could find  and it is a Ford Ranger with no options save the am fm stereo  which I begrudgingly accepted As far as automobiles go  I would consider myself an audiophile  and car audio is the major concern that leads me to think negatively about this particular truck  For some reason  Ford insists on using 5 quot x7 quot  speakers in many of their light trucks  The reason this is a problem is because aftermarket 5 quot x7 quot  speakers can be hard to find  Even harder to find are top quality speakers in this size arrangement  All that can be circumvented by inconveniently using the incorrect size for the available speaker mounting  Of course  unless you really know what you re doing  Mr  Car Stereo Installer will charge you around  50 to make sizers so that they fit properly That is just the beginning of the problem  Unlike many other trucks  the Ranger has almost no room underneath the seats  What this means is that  short of a minor miracle  you can t place an external amplifier anywhere but behind the seats  This arrangement creates another problem  If a subwoofer were to be installed along with that amplifier  the entire jack assembly behind the seat needs to be removed  Due to this  my jack is now underneath my passenger seat  Not a real problem  but lets say another amp were added for better fidelity and volume  two amps and a subwoofer enclosure are almost impossible to fit behind the seats in this narrow cab  This is where the underseat space comes into play  because with many other light pickups  an amp could be placed under either seat  facilitating greater flexability in the setup behind the seat   such as two subwoofers or a subwoofer and a pair of 6 quot x9 quot  enclosures Now  I realize no car truck is perfect  However  a new car should be relatively problem free for the first year in my opinion  Inside of the first 6 months  I experienced the following problems  Straight from the dealer  the plastic molding on the right front pillar wasnt installed properly  The interior light for  ironically  the lighting controls ceased functioning  The dashboard developed a persistent  and very annoying  creak  The seat developed a slight tear  And  lastly  the wheel alignment went astray to the right  The conclusion that I have to draw is that the Ranger is not the most rugged of vehicles  which is a bit disappointing  it being a truck and all  Overall  the vehicle has not been a vast disappointment  The gas mileage has been right where the sticker said it should be  I have not needed to have any routine parts  such as headlights or turn signal bulbs  replaced  The suspension is a bit bumpy  but that s to be expected from a truck  The power steering works great  although  on my particular vehicle  the right tire rubs against the wheel well if the steering wheel is turned completely to the right  The manual transmission is tight  and the engine produces good pickup for a 4 cylinder  The tires that come standard with the vehicle are terrible on anything but dry pavement  My final analysis of the Ford Ranger is that it is a servicable vehicle  but nothing I could find myself recommending to a friend  or waiting in anticipation to buy     
Neg, I bought a new Ford Ranger  four door  last day of June this year  actually it was a lease purchase type of deal  Red Carpet  I paid  2 600 cash down and I had a four hundred dollar discount coupon  making my total down  3 000  I noticed right away that it road walked  and didn t handle well on curves  I had traded in a little Nissan and it handled like a dream on curves  with this Ranger I had to go slower than the curve sign amount of miles suggested  Also every little bump in the road  the rear end would like bounce off to the right or left  road walk  and at high speeds it would feel like I was about to loose control sometimes and startle me  I convinced myself at first that it was just the difference between a big truck and a little one  then I decided I would take it in on my next days off and get it checked  since it was a fifty mile drive  I never got the chance on the way home from work one morning  I had a right rear blow out and rolled the pick up after only having it two weeks  Then the air bag came out about the size of a basket ball and burst  there I was lying on the driver s side and this nasty smoke coming out of the air bag about to choke me to death  I turned off the ignition because the smoke alarmed me and I thought the thing was on fire  To make a long story short after being given the run around by rude people at the Ford motor company  and my insurance would not cover all the amount owed on the truck I drove an old car of my mom s for 2 and 1 2 months  and still no replacement  I will never consider another Ford vehicle of any type again br br  
Neg, Sorry  Ford lovers  maybe Ford was good in the 70 s but now they have really lost it on quality  Nice looking truck  maybe  but when will you get to drive it when it s always in the shop  Ok here s the story  A relative ordered a 1999 Ford Ranger XLT4WD  loaded  She was so excited and she had been a faithful Ford buyer for 40 years  She waited and waited and waited finally after many delays it comes in and yes  it s a nice looking truck  It has lots of features BUT after a couple of weeks  it s in the shop for one thing or another  She gets it out and then something else goes wrong  This goes on for months thank goodness she has more than one vehicle or she would be in bad shape   You can t always get a loaner  Engine problems  wiring problems  plastic parts break off in cab  Seat adjusters won t work  Ok  so you say  you didn t actually OWN this truck  You are right  but this is not the first Ford Ranger she has had and after awhile they start falling apart  I was a witness to this  I know that they are rated highly  but please investigate before you purchase  that is a lot of money to spend to have it in the repair shop all the time UPDATE 11 8 00 I have been getting a lot of feedback on this rating  but I stick to my original opinion  This truck MAY have been a lemon  but keep this is mind  within the first year the engine had to be replaced  wiring worked on  a c repaired door lock replaced  twice  and other miscellaneous repairs  Be advised that she did buy the extended warranty and is very glad that she did  She will Not be buying another Ford truck in the future  She continues to have problems and this not even to mention the Firestone tires that had to be replaced  Sorry again Ford Lovers Another UPDATE  7 01 Ignition had to be replaced Wind blows through the truck like a window is slightly cracked  but you can t seem to find out where the air leak is   A loud whistling noise  Also  the tailgate is hard to latch  it doesn t seem to fit well I ve stated before that I am not the owner  Thank heavens  so I don t have to worry about the expenses  but whenever I drive the vehicle  it drives fine Without knowing the history of this vehicle  I would assume that it was great  so please ask questions if you consider buying one  And just to let you know  I have owned several Fords in the past  both cars and trucks  and were happy with them  Those were the good ole days  Buyer beware it ain t like it used to be  
Neg, I purchased my 1999 Ford Ranger new in June of 1999  It was a four wheel drive flareside regular cab with the xlt and off road package  Let me start off by saying that Ford offers excellent financing  I got 2 9  they also offer competitive rebates  Usually you have to choose either the rebate or the low finance rate  In addition to the affordability  I chose my truck because of its looks and style  From the day I drove off the lot I got compliments on what a  cool truck  I had  Initially I was pleased with my truck  After a few months I started noticing creaks in the dash  this seemed unusual for a truck so new  I also received a recall notice from Ford for a faulty wiper switch which if not replaced could short out the system  Into Ford I went for this problem to be fixed  A few months later my entire truck began to shake above 50mph  This brought me into the dealership again where after examination  they determined that it was a snapped bolt in the driveshaft assembly  This problem was fixed under warranty  but disturbed me a bit as the truck had only 20 000 miles on it  Shortly after that I received a flat tire on a road going aprox  40mph  After careful inspection by a mechanic  it was discovered that the tire went flat due to a faulty valve  I m glad I was only going 40mph Gas mileage for me was slightly below the sticker  I consistently got 18 20mph with mostly highway driving  While economy and truck do not usually go together  I was disturbed by the fact that full size Chevrolets average 25mpg with larger engines than my Ranger  I had the 3 0 V6 Overall I liked the truck  but not enough to keep it  Rising gas prices and disappointments led me to trade my truck for a new Honda 2001 Civic  see my review  That leads me to my last complaint  Resale value  This truck only had 26 000 miles on it at the time of trade  I shopped numerous dealerships and looked at several different model cars  I just broke even on my balance due Ford of aprox  11 000 00  This truck had a sticker price when new of  19 135 00  I know American cars depreciate faster than foreign models but give me a break  My truck was in showroom condition  I guess you get what you pay for My final word is if your looking for an inexpensive truck that gets you from point a to b and you can handle constant  quirks  buy a Ford Ranger  Otherwise shop around  
Neg, Right now I drive a 1999 Ranger 4X4 x cab 4dr 4 0L  but I d like to go back to my first in 1986 when I as 19  NEW Ranger  1My dad co signed for my first new truck  I bought a 86  Ranger standard cab 4X4 STX with one of the first push button 4X4 systems  I thought that was  way cool  back then  As far as longevity goes for this one I can t say but I know it could take a lot  Being a stupid 19yr old kid and adding a 100 000 mi bumper to bumper that I was told would cover any thing I drove it as if I was Mickey Thompson  I lived to get all fours off the ground and being a 19yr old party animal in a rural community I found opportunity practically daily  I was 4by n with a friend in this truck and making those tv commercials appear tame and in the mist of roaring laughter and fast paced action my friend turns to me and says  quot next time around let me out quot  I reply  quot you scared quot  and he says  quot no I ve only seen this on tv quot  and this was daily with this truck  being reckless I totaled it with 12 000 mi on it and it NEVER SAW A SHOP ONCE  That s damn good when you consider those off road racers rebuild those truck after each race  To give you the sense of reckless abandon that 19 yr old drove his truck with remember in  quot Ferris Bueller s Day Off quot  the parking attendants faces in the Ferrai as it was flying through the air  That was the elation I experienced for 12 000 miles  My relationship with that truck is like looking back on old girlfriends from my youth  The times I had and the memories I would never want removed but I could never have that type of a relationship with a vehicle again and have never had all four off the ground with any other vehicle in my life since  By the way  to this day I still remember the salesman saying  quot You ll be a Ford man for life quot  so far he s been right So now I go through a few used vehicle wondering if buying new is worth it NEW Ranger  21991 just broke up with a girl and replace her with a truck  A little    
Neg, I owned two Ford Rangers  First  1989 STX Ext Cab  and currently 1999 Ranger Standard Cab  Both 4WD  Something has happened in those 11 years  First Ranger I drove for 8 years  Ran great  4WD worked well nice bucket seats  solid build  good turning radius  but a bit under powered This current beast is an entirely different animal  It began to make questionable noises within my first year of ownership  I m 6ft1 and a little too big for the interior  Very uncomfortable and the seats did a number on my back Then came the recalls  1  Steering column wiper blinkers assembly 2  water pump 3  THE TIRES  which I must ad  are horrible quality  When I did some investigating  I found even more  features Now  I bet you re wondering if drive my vehicles hard  NOT AT ALL  I have owned this rolling nightmare for 30 months  and I only have 14K miles on it  All of which are basic city driving To  William Clay Ford  get to work you silver spooner  you just lost another customer  
Neg, I am a cautious driver  with fairly decent maintenance record  The truck is a fairly nice truck by looks and comfort  I got what I paid for    12 000  But  I am not impressed by the manufacturing and engineering of this 99 Ford Ranger  I wish Ford would try to ensure quality in the mechanical and electrical parts of the vehicle  That is  after all  what drives the trucks  not the cushion seats and the pretty red finish  although those are nice ABS  ODOMETER  SPEEDOMETER do not work  no recall for my particular vin   Multi function switch does not work properly  wipers go wild  and no recall for my particular vin   Tierod recently went out  Upper brake lights continually go out  Insistent pinging while using low mid grade gas  must use premium disgusted by the lack of recall of defective parts  not very thorough in their recalls Would I buy again  only if they improve their quality standards and maintaining a good service record with owners  I e  being honest to repair defective parts fs 
Neg, What a car  I test drove one today and loved it  I was not expecting to be impressed  I was expecting to cross this vehicle off of my list of prospective purchases in the next month or so It all started when a girl in my study hall started bragging about hers  Of course from here I had to make fun of it constantly  One day she had enough of it and took me for a ride   I never made fun of it again  b Pros  The 1996 Thunderbird LX I test drove was definitely a well equipped car  It had power windows  door locks and mirrors that worked well  The windows came down at an average pace  This car came with a CD player from the factory in 1996  as well as an alarm keyless entry  The keyless entry was just as good as any I ve seen from the factory  Poor range  but at least it was there  The trunk release was very nice on the key ring  The trunk release in the car was kind of hard to find  but under the armrest is a nice place after you know where it is at The  3 8 L  V6  with  Fuel Injection  put a hefty amount of power to the ground for a non turbo V6 in a medium weight car  I d estimate quarter mile time to be about 18 and 0 60 time to be about 13 seconds  The speedometer goes to 120 mph and I m certain this car could do it  It even sounded pretty nice  a little on the whiny side  but still an agressive sound The dash is well laid out with the speedometer and tachometer  The other five gauges oil pressure  temp  fuel  amperes meter  and something else I can t remember  were small and oddly placed  I have no doubt that you would get used to them quickly  though I felt like I was in the driver seat of a truck this thing was so roomy  My legs were not cramped  the seat was easily adjustable  Both of my arms were rested nicely  The steering wheel had an adjustable height  which the salesman insisted I had too high  I lowered it and felt cramped  but where I initially had it  it was very nice The deep blue interior matched the sky blue exterior very nicely  The seats were plush and comfortable  The rear seat offered a lot more room than I was expecting  similar to my Blazer  It felt very comfortable  It would be easy to fall asleep in the back seats  Easily sitting four people comfortably  The transmission drive shaft hump and the distance the center consol came back made the center seat useless This car did not afford the gas mileage I would hope for  but the salesman insisted that it would get 22 mpg city  This is a decent number  especially when you can have as much fun in this car as you can  The rear wheel drive was the culprit named by the salesman in the lost gas mileage  I m not sure how this could have effected it  but he did seem to know a lot about cars Handling was a dream  I was darting in and out of traffic to the dismay of the salesman  with no body roll  I took a Clover Leaf onramp at 80 mph and a car could not have been more sturdy under me  I believe with a larger engine  I easily could have gone faster and been as secure With a rear defogger and nice windshield wipers  your view would be unobstructed  For a coupe  there was a good bit of visibility both by looking back or in the mirrors  I did not check the blind spots  but they seem like it would be a very small space This is the most beautiful car Ford ever designed  Compared to this  the Mustang is a pug nosed box b Neutral  My friends 1989 Turbo had automatic seatbelts  This one didn t  According to the salesman  the government had outlawed them for two reasons  First because when the motor died  people could not put the belt on  Second because the pillar was too far forward and instead of holding someone back at the chest  it would move up to their throats  The manual safetybelts were an inconvenience  but I can definitely see their pros Although the driver seat felt as though it would be comfortable for long trips  it did not offer Lumbar support  A pillow would fix that problem  The headrests left something to be desired  although I m sure they could be adjusted with a bit of force To open the hood took a bit of effort  something that you would not grow accustomed to  This would only be a minor inconvenience The dealer said that you could not get fog lights for this vehicle  This disappointed me because I think it would look very aggressive with a set close to the ground  When I tried to engage the fog lights  the head light dial came apart  It was easily put back on  but it was surprising the cheap quality of the plastic b Cons  These are few  the only thing I noticed was that the engine was kind of crammed into the engine bay  Maintenance could be difficult  There are lots of wires running around  and other intrusive things  Timing would be a breeze though  with the location of the distributor the salesman called it something else  but I can t recall The trunk space was adequate  but the seat would not fold down  The spare tire was a donut when it appeared that a full size could have fit The size of the rear tires 255 mm across  made it impossible to spin or even squawk the tires  Admittedly  you don t need to do this  but it is always nice to be able to make some noise  Perhaps in a Turbo V6 or V8 version The automatic transmission was very smooth  It shifted delicately and wasn t constantly searching for the right gear  It only shifted down if I really hit the gas  I m certain a significant amount of power was lost here  My mothers Blazer has a 4300 Vortec V6 with an automatic transmission  It will squawk the tires from a standstill  I drove an S15 Sonoma with a 4 3 Liter V6 with TBI Throttle Body Injection  that yielded 28 hp over the Vortec  The GMC was a manual and I couldn t keep the rear end on the ground  I could feel much more power being put on the ground with the manual transmission  The  96 T Bird  does not have a Manual transmission option   You can get a  95 T Bird Supercoupe with manual transmission  but with the supercharged V6 your insurance is going to skyrocket  I can t believe Ford put only automatic transmissions in a car that seems like it has such sporty potential b Overall  I would recommend this car to my older friends  It is a good price  lots of features  very comfortable  The power is ok and it is a gorgeous car  It is not an economy car by any means  but you ll have a lot of fun driving it I do not recommend this car to anyone that wants a sports car because you will have such a hard time regaining the performance out of it that is lost with the automatic transmission If this car came with a manual transmission  I would probably purchase one I discussed the new T Bird with the sales man  he said he really liked the styling  I for one strongly disagree with Ford s design in this new car br br  
Neg, I owned a 1996 Thunderbird LX v6 for 8 months and here s my first impression  fun for the city  smooth on the highway  but I m not sad I sold it The engine is a low horsepower high torque v6  3 8 liters with only 145hp  It does have 220 ft lbs of torque  so it pushes you back in your seat leaping from stoplight to stoplight  Get it on the freeway and this big v6 can hardly hit 100  I would say acceleration is good up to 55  then it tapers off The build quality inside was decent very plastic looking effects and velour everywhere  It did prove very durable and quite comfortable  The seats were like Barcaloungers soft and squishy  They didn t promote great posture and after long trips it made my back a bit sore The trunk was voluminous  but backseat space was pretty small  Front seat room was huge  lots of room over my head The Automatic transmission was one of the better ones I ve driven  always shifting at about the right spot  Occasionally on the highway it would disengage gears and rev the motor while trying to kick down for passing speed  which was a little un nerving The stereo was horrid but very easy to replace  including the awful little speakers  This was probably the most important money I put in the car The only repair I had was when the torque converter acted up and made the car shake in 3rd and 4th gear  Turns out the fluid used by Ford was less than optimal and a change to synthetic fixed the problem  as recommended by Ford Motor Company The car did not have anti lock brakes  an airbag  or a limited slip differential  all of which were promised by the salesman  Don t go to a Ford dealer I would rate the mechanical quality of the car at good  the interior at average  I sold the car and bought an Audi Coupe Quattro  the ownership of which I have not regretted for a moment  I will rate it  not recommended  just because I wouldn t go out of my way to drive one again it was good but there are better out there  
Neg,  It s a way of life  My wife had always wanted a Mustang so last year we bought one of the first  99 Cobras off the truck  Our Cobra is a rio red coupe with medium parchment interior  I had some experiences with the Mustangs of the late  80s but there is no comparison  This is a true sports car  The new IRS make the car handle like it is on rails  What other car can you purchase for under  30k that has a hand built engine  The SVT folks treat you right also  The latest gift is a leather Jacket  The only negatives is the noise level inside the car  This is to be expected with a true performance car but it gets old on road trips     
Neg, I ve had my Ford Explorer now since 1993  It s been every where from Washington DC to Miami  FL  where it was purchased  to Alabama and now here to sunny  yeah right  San Diego  I must say that it would have been cheaper renting a car during my long travels rather then pay for the repairs on my Ford  Two months after I first purchased the vehicle  I had to call  quot road side assistance quot  because of a dead battery  When I went to the Ford dealership to find out what was wrong with the vehicle  they told me that the battery was old  OLD  HUH  Two months is OLD  Come to find out  the manufacture put a 1991 battery  that was probably sitting around in some warehouse begging for a sucker  that s me  to get stuck with him  in my 1993 vehicle  Oh but the fun s only beginning My Ford Explorer  29 000 miles young needs what  You guessed it  tires  At 135 dollars a pop  guess ole  Firestone loved that  WRONG manufactures defect on the tires  the treads were separating with no signs of normal wear and tear  Joyous  something free for a change 34 000 miles young ahhh  you need a new starter  we have a re call on your side mirror  something about catching on fire  blah blah blah  and low and behold  you need not only new brake pads  but the entire brake system needs replacing  for you southern Californian s  I guess it s what Brake Depot would call a  quot break system nightmare quot  Well  at least it was still under warranty  but boy are the mechanics at Ford and I becoming close friends Bare with me  quot auto experts quot  if I don t explain something adequately  You know us woman brake shoes shoulder pads  what s the difference  right smile  All right on to the 36 000 mile mark what  New tires AGAIN  And a muffler  etc  etc  and so on  Seems as though the older Ford Explorer models have front alignment problems which cause the tires to wear uneven  etc  So that lifetime alignment I purchased  the up keep on the alignment  rotation  oil changes  fuel injector cleanings  etc  etc  really haven t helped MUCH in the long run  The biggest problem with having something go wrong with your Ford   for those of you who drive Explorers  I m sure you ll agree  the Explorer would NOT start would not start long enough for me to drive it ANY WHERE It dies where it dies just the towing expenses alone would have been horrible if it hadn t been covered under my insurance On to the grand finale at 65 000 miles  still  young  I had the pleasure of experiencing a Ford transmission failure  unfortunately I was in the process of driving when it happened   1 800 00 dollars to re vive my Ford  hard parts soft parts  you name it my transmission needed it  Now  I know that in order to maintain the driving performance on your vehicle  you have to service it and take care of it  but in my case  I ve basically bought enough parts to build a brand new Explorer over the past 7 years  I know that 7 years seems like a long time  but the majority of this work was done during the first three years of my little guy s life  I would DEFINITELY not recommend someone purchasing an older model Explorer  did I mention the fact that I ve had my tires replaced 8 TIMES  I ve heard some really great stories from friends who have the newer Explorers  but because of all of the problems that I ve had with this little  quot baby quot  I wont be trading him in for a newer model  I might just try my luck with a Honda br br  
Neg, Okay  I m 19  and I ve been driving this death trap for 3 years  previously it was driven by my mother  so nothing you read is because of abuse  at least not long time abuse I have to say  anybody who says this is a good truck is so completely wrong that you might as well not read the review at all if they say so  It is an AWFUL truck  What s wrong  Hmmm  well  that begs the question  where to start Handling The truck actually isn t an awful handler  but body roll is severe  and it really bucks over bumps  Dive  the front end going down when braking  is terribly pronounced  Squat  the front end going up under acceleration  is not bad  but that s more a factor of the anemic engine than the suspension  On road  at the speed limit  the car is adequate  However  as I had the car when I was 16 and stupid  I know what it will do at more than double the speed limit  and that is feel like it s going to tip  On easy or moderate off roading  the Explorer is alright  however  on severe off road conditions  it falls apart  The truck bucks violently and generally feels like it s about to break Performance Well  the engine is a 170 horsepower V6 in a 4000  lb  truck  It accelerates slowly from any speed  and highway merging must be done at full throttle or you risk endangering people in the right lane  I did a few mods to the truck  a  performance   ha  airbox  a dual exhaust  and a chip  I d guess it had 180 horsepower after all that  Maybe 185  Anyway  nothing you can do  short of an engine swap  will make it accelerate fast  Even after all those mods  the thing couldn t even squeal its tires in a straight line  unless it was raining  And it s not just the engine  The brakes on this truck are awful  made even worse by a capricious ABS system which will activate in the dry  going less than 10 mph  or not activate at 40 mph when it s wet and causing the car to go sideways   I could see straight ahead through the passenger side window  All in all  even if you expected a poor performing vehicle  this one sucks Exterior I personally don t like the slab sided  blunt ended  aerodynamics of a brick look  but hey  that s subjective  Objectively  it isn t helping fuel economy  My truck was also purple  so that may be a small factor in my point of view Interior The main problem with the interior is that  like many Detroit products  it isn t well built  Plastics screwed onto plastics screwed onto metal is a great recipe for squeaks  and the Explorer definitely evinces these  The seat belts also rattle against the doors  and almost all interior trim panels can be wiggled by hand  and mostly pried away from their mounting surfaces  The cargo pad  or whatever you want to call it  is attached by velcro to velcro fasteners which are glued onto plastic  These gave way within a few months  so now I have no cargo pad  And both passenger side air vents are broken  because Ford couldn t be bothered to make them out of metal  so they were constructed from cheap  flimsy plastic  like most of the inside  The seats are fairly comfortable  and there s enough room for 4  5 s a stretch  and the middle rear seat absolutely sucks because of the always trying to retract lap belt that locks as tight as possible  Why couldn t it be adjustable  Because Ford motor company hates you  The mirror in the driver s side visor is also broken  because my mother put the window up when it was sticking out  That WAS partially her fault  but why couldn t Ford install some sort of stop on the thing  Because Ford is run by fools Reliability Well  it hasn t been good  With 80 000 miles in 10 years  you d think the radiator wouldn t have blown  You d also think the visors wouldn t be cracked and falling down  and that the car would get better than 14 mpg  maybe 20 if I had a lighter foot  The thing always has something wrong  Lately it s been the power door locks not being powered anymore  and the center console working it s way loose so I can shake it about 3  in either direction  this of course is another example of plastic screwed onto metal  which just destroys the plastic  giving it the play  The vacuum lines have all decayed  so they had to be replaced  The shocks were also replaced because the car was rolling  diving  and squating too much  Then I realized the shocks were fine  because the new ones didn t control body motions at all Misc One thing that really bugs me about the Explorer is that it has absolutely almost no safety features  No airbags  no traction control  no stability control  only pre tensioning safety belts Overall All in all  I hate the truck  My view is slightly skewed because my parents had Mercedes  and BMWs and wouldn t even buy a newer Explorer  but hey  the truck really is a poor choice for anyone  Please  don t get suckered into buying one  
Neg, We  quot inherited quot  a 1993 Ford Explorer in December of 1998  It was great until it had about 100 000 miles on it and just stopped at a red light  It would start  but when we put it in to drive  it stalled  We had it towed to a transmission place  When we called the mechanic  he said   quot Let me guess it has between 70 80 000 miles on it quot  We said no  that it had about 100 000  He then told us how lucky we were because we got an extra 20 000 miles out of the old transmission  He told us that he installs at least five new transmissions on Explorers a week  It was a pretty good car up to that point  other than the fact that it s small engine can t go up hills very easily  We drove this car to Colorado from Texas and prayed the whole way  It barely made it there and back  struggling the whole way  I urge you to call a transmission shop before you buy an Explorer  They will be able to tell you much better than I am     
Neg, My husband and I bought our Ford Explorer XLT in 1993  My husband HAD to have this vehicle  It was great driving it when it was new but my husband drove it mostly  until he obtained a company car and we sold our other car and I now owned this Explorer  At 36k miles I had to replace the tires  The vehicle began to shimmy and I have had the tires rotated  balanced  aligned and to no avail  I have talked to other Explorer owners who have had the same problem and Ford could not fix the problem  I have also had to replace routers every time I have had a break job done  This has been a cost of over  600 dollars  The passenger side rear door handle broke and will not open from the inside  Again I know other Explorer owners who had this problem  The computer died and had to be replaced  Fortunately it was still under warranty and it didn t cost me anything  The paint on the hood of the vehicle started to crack from underneath the clearcoat  Not to mention the many recalls  I also had to have the thermostat replaced because the vehicle started to run hot  replaced may batteries  Have had to replace the bushings because they are located too close to the engine and this causes them to melt faster  I will be needing to replace them again soon at a cost of over  150 I have also had the experience of riding in an Expedition and I felt the same vibration starting on it as I felt on the Explorer when we bought it I feel that the Expedition will have the same problems as the Explorer br br  
Neg, I bought this vehicle thinking i could take it on long trips  access remote vacationing areas  and hauling my boat  What I got was a gas guzzling snail  The Ford Explorer provides absolutely no power and is capable of nothing  While unsafe for street driving  it lacks the ground clearance for off road use  i bet i could find a Ferrari with more ground clearance than that of the Ford Explorer  I bought this car fully loaded  It had the works and let me tell you about these  quot works quot  The leather is of lowest quality  It comes with air holes poked all over the seat which look very cheap  This rig is about as nimble as a 747  Watch out for the roll factor when cornering at what you think is a reasonable speed  The Explorer has an extremely high center of gravity which makes it one of the most flipped automobiles on the road today  dispite the minimal ground clearance  Ford has found a way to still make the Explorer unsafe  The constipated roar that lurkes beneath the hood is nothing but empty power  There were VERY few things that satisfied me about this truck     
Neg, There s good news and bad news  First with the good news  I ve managed to squeeze out 165 000 miles from this truck and she s still running  That s more than a lot of other people can say for their vehicles  On that point I am  indeed  satisfied The bad news I ve also had quite a few problems along the way  I ll start by saying that I would be cautious about buying one of these trucks used  During my first 36 000 miles I had to have a couple of repairs done to the front axle  From about miles through 40 000   100 000 I had random problems with the electrical system that caused it to not start  I don t mind paying to get a vehicle fixed  but I absolutely can t stand being stranded by my vehicle  At 96 000 miles the manual transmission went out and that had to be replaced with a rebuilt one  This was a nightmare in and of itself  but that s another story all together  This cost about  1800 to get fixed  Luckily it was covered under an extended warranty through my insurance company that was about to expire at 100 000 miles  At about 130 000 miles the 4x4 went bad so I can t use that anymore  Around 115 000 miles the air conditioner went bad  Not knowing how much further this vehicle would last I decided not to get the  1000 dollar repair  Had I not had those previous problems  I probably would have pitched in the  1000 dollars to get the AC fixed  Oh well  hindsight is 20 20  These are the major problems that I ve had  Along the way a number of other issues have popped up as well  There was a recall on the emergency brake and there was also a recall on the rear window  Additionally it seems like the plastics on the inside are really flimsy  The handle to my driver side door snapped off at about 90 000 miles and the dashboard vents to the AC have broken so that you can t adjust the direction of the airflow  The armrest that sits between the passenger and driver has even broken off  So now I just lay the arm rest where it was once secured in place  Oh yes  the tape deck has always been screwy  sometimes eating my tapes  ever since about 20 000 miles on  I don t even bother with it anymore  All in all  I m glad to say that I was able to squeeze out 165 000 miles from this  and believe it or not my last 30 000 miles have been less troublesome than my first 30 000 miles  Even with soooo many miles  I m hesitant to try another one of these again considering the problems it s had  Since it did actually get me 165 000 miles I m giving this a 3 and not a lower score  Good luck br br  
Neg, If my truck had been a boat  I doubt I would have made it out of the port  I have had so many problems with my  1995 Ford Ranger XLT Supercab  since purchasing it brand new that it s a wonder it hasn t just spontaneously combusted  but with my luck I probably would have been sitting in it if that would have happened  The funny thing is someone even tried to steal my truck back in 1996 but they gave up pretty quick for some reason  I suspect I now know why b i NOTE  Prices in Canadian Dollars   b The Good Stuff About My Truck  It s a great looking truck  When you sit and just look at it  it really looks good  Too bad it doesn t do a whole lot of good for me to just sit and look at it The seats are fantastic  60 40 split bench  If there is one thing that has stood the test of time with my truck  it s the drivers seat  It is very comfortable for those long drives  my parents live 6 hours away from Calgary  and the upholstery is quite durable  Have never had any stain problems and everything is very easy to clean I tend to take a lot of stuff when I travel  The good thing about the Ranger with the extended cab is there is a lot of space  I even squeezed seven people into my truck once  not against their will Power is always a plus with any truck  and mine is not too shabby in that department  With a V6  4L engine and 170 HP it has quite a bit of kick for a small truck  Definitely a good thing The fuel efficiency on my truck is also not too bad  especially for a truck  I don t know exactly what it is but I can generally make it around 500 KMS  310 Miles  on   of a tank of gas b The Forgotten Realms Series of Fantasy Books About  The Time of Troubles  Surprisingly Are NOT About My Truck  Although They Could Easily Have Been  The most defective part of my truck all these years has been the breaks  I can t get through a year without having break problems such as pulling to one side or trembling when I push on the brakes  I ve had my breaks replaced two times over the course of about 130 000 KMS  80 000 Miles  and the problems always seem to return  I do drive in the city a lot  but I know plenty of people with a wide variety of vehicles and models that have never had the break problems I have had  I d like to think brakes are supposed to last a little longer than 45 000 KMS  28 000 Miles  and not have to be constantly serviced  Total brake repair costs to date   2000 The most expensive one time problem I have had with my truck was a couple of years ago  at around 75 000 KMS  46 000 Miles  My truck wouldn t start a couple of times and I was informed by my mechanic I had to have my head gaskets rebuilt at a cost of over  1000  Apparently there was oil leaking from them which was causing overheating and setting off a sensor that was not allowing the engine to start  None of the other Ford vehicles in my family have ever had head gasket problems  we all have around the same number of KMS Miles on our vehicles Ford actually issued a recall of head gaskets a year or two ago on a wide range of vehicles which included some 1995 models  but sadly the recall did not include Rangers  On the bright side  since the repairs have been done I have had no further engine problems  knock on wood Shortly after my 60 000 KM  37 000 Miles  warranty ran out on my truck I encountered a couple of annoying problems  my headlights wouldn t turn on and my door ajar sensor would stick for up to a half hour   Oh the sweet sounds of DING  DING  DING  DING For some reason one day when I went to switch my headlights to high beam the system shorted out and all I had left was the daylight driving lights  Cost to repair    300  And then there is the door ajar sensor  I ve had to replace it twice because it kept sticking on no matter what I tried to fix it  Cost to repair   Around  200 each time  My brother s Ranger has also had this problem  although he only had to replace his sensor once In addition to these problems  I have had plenty of minor problems such as the engine mis firing at higher speeds  above 100 KPH   62 MPH  but most were covered by the original warranty or a recent repair warranty  This still doesn t take away from the fact I cannot seem to go more than a month or two without encountering some new or repeat problem with the truck b Overall Opinion Summary  Although I m not ever planning on getting a Ford Ranger ever  ever  ever again  I m still a Ford fan  My family owns 4 Ford vehicles and mine has been the only true dud of the batch  I really do believe I just bought the truly  horribly bad truck of the batch   so I am rating my truck 1 out of 5 overall b The Non Fun I ve Had With My Truck  Not related to vehicle defects  at least directly b Although some of the problems I ve had with my truck I m about to detail are crappy  they are generally  NOT  related to the quality of the truck or the defects I have had to deal with  I just want to illustrate the point that I honestly think my truck is cursed  Anyone know a good exorcist It all started with an attempted break in while my friend and I were at a hockey game  The thief had attempted to knock out the passenger side door lock with a screw driver or something but had failed  I suspect the truck probably growled at the would be thief or something and scared him off  I swiftly responded to the attempted break in with the installation of a car alarm After shopping around for a decent price  I settled on A B Sound in NE Calgary for my alarm choice  I left my truck for the day and the alarm was installed  End of story  Nope  I had to return 3 more times because the alarm did not  agree  with my truck and would false constantly  So we upgraded the alarm to try and solve the problem  End of Story  Nope  Had to return 2 more times because the alarm still didn t agree with my truck  Finally they figured they had the problem beat and even decided to compensate me by installing a remote car starter along with the final repairs for cost and no installation charge at  60  I took the deal and have never had any alarm or starter problems since thank goodness But the problems didn t end there for me  of course  The next incident I had with the truck was a near severe accident  I was driving back to Calgary from visiting my parents in my home town  and while driving down the highway I watched in horror as a fully loaded dump truck ran a stop sign heading right in my path  I actually yanked the steering wheel and skidded down the highway at a 90 degree angle avoiding an accident  I got off the highway and the guy walked over to me and profusely apologized for 5 minutes while I tried to calm down  It was brutal to say the least I m not going to go into details about the next two fun events but they go like this  1  hit by a guy that ran a red light   8000 damage covered by insurance  2  my friend and I  largely because of our silliness  got stuck under an apartment garage door while moving stuff out of his old apartment causing damage to my windshield wipers and hood   Cost  600 The last one I m going to mention is the doozy of the whole stack  I had brake problems  as usual  back in 1999 and took them to a local mechanic to be serviced  Upon leaving I noticed my breaks were making a ton of noise so I went back only to find out they had screwed the job up  So a few hours later everything was supposed to be completely fixed  So I headed home  I was supposed to head across the city  via our major freeway  to pick up a friend after the repairs were done but he canceled at the last minute so I just headed home  thankfully Upon returning home I decided to head to the nearby grocery store to grab some stuff  and when I was a few blocks away from my house  my breaks completely failed  I had none  I quickly kicked the truck into 2nd and 1st gears to slow down and coasted home  luckily there was very little traffic around at the time  What I found out when I had the truck towed to Ford  where I had NOT had the repairs done at  was that someone had put oil in my master cylinder  this thing regulates the break fluid for your vehicle  I actually still have the one with the oil in it in my possession  I had service done at both Ford and a local mechanic within a two week time period so there was no way to squarely place the blame on either one  or so I was told At this point  or probably some point long before this point  you probably asked yourself  why didn t this guy get rid of this truck a long time ago  Well that s a darn good question  Every time there was a problem  I basically hoped and prayed it was the last  And it just seemed like I had invested so much into the truck that it would be an even bigger waste to get rid of it now  Perhaps the light at the end of the tunnel is over the past year I have had the least number of problems since I ve owned the freaking thing  A friend of mine speculated that if we poured holy water on my truck  it would probably growl at us and catch on fire or something  Don t suppose anyone else out there also has a cursed Ranger b Amount Paid  In Canadian b   22 000 
Neg, I purchased a brand new bright red truck in November 1995 my husband said   not another red truck  Yes  I like red  and I like trucks I had brought home a darker blue truck  but it was automatic  power windows  and other frilly stuff that I didn t want or want to pay extra for  My truck had the following features 6 cylinder  standard transmission  5 speed  anti lock brakes  back sliding window  long bed  A C  power steering  and a bed liner What I liked about this truck  at the time I bought it  was that we could all fit into it  However  for my older kids  the fold down jump seats in the back section were uncomfortable on long trips  The last big trip was from Tennessee to Oklahoma and then back  My son at the time was 15 and my daughter was 12  They were most uncomfortable and had to take turns riding up front  And I liked the price  It cost  12 799 with all the financial stuff  This was the third vehicle that I bought at  Woody Anderson Ford  in Huntsville  AL  And If I still lived there  I probably would have traded it there and bought another Ford product I was faithful about regular maintenance  but this silly truck had a mind of its own  First it was the door open chime it just would not shut off  Back to the dealership  it was covered under the warranty  Then the wipers went off on their own back to the dealership  covered by warranty  By this time I was wondering if I had made a good decision about this truck  Then the interior light would not shut off  my husband just got a potholder from the kitchen and yanked the bulb out  He was beginning to be frustrated by constant trips to the dealer for little electrical repairs I noticed a smell around 35 000 miles or so  Something was hot under my truck  I took it in and asked them if there was anything under there that might get hot during driving  They checked the radiator  and other items like brakes etc but not the problem  After the big trip to Oklahoma  it finally broke  and it was a carrier bearing  My mechanic basically told me that this was a design flaw since the drive shaft was not so long  it didn t really need to be built like this  Just another moving part to break Once all of the electrical problems were repaired and the carrier bearing was repaired  the truck was very reliable for 120 000 miles  And a trip to South Carolina  Myrtle Beach  At that time it was traded for a much more comfortable vehicle for our growing family of 5  We bought a  Plymouth Grand Voyager   van  See my review on it please My truck was not a reliable vehicle in ice it froze to the ground and we could not budge it no matter what we tried hahahhaha only in Tennessee right  Okay  so maybe it was built on a Monday  maybe it was just that model year  But I did not buy another Ford truck and I had owned 2  so maybe I ll let Fords rest and get a Toyota or a Chevy next truck purchase  
Neg, The early  90s were good for Ford  Sales were strong  recalls were few  Firestone tires were the norm and there was nothing wrong with that  By 1992 the Taurus had overtaken the Honda Accord as the best selling car in America  In fact it held on to the position until 1997 when the Toyota Camry won the sales race  So what was it about the Taurus that made it sell so well  Was it the looks  the performance  the quality  the price  I had only one encounter of an older Taurus before last week  a beat up 1989 model that a friend of mine used to own  Last week I got to drive a 1993 Taurus GL with only 71 000 miles  How would it compare to the last older Taurus I drove Powertrain  C  This Taurus like so may others had the venerable 3 0 liter pushrod  Vulcan  V6  It was good for about 140 horsepower  Keep in mind that the Taurus was amongst the bigger midsizers of its time so it was not surprising that this 3 0 liter was not quite up to the job  This engine makes quite a lot of noise for not much grunt and it knocked pretty bad  The performance is not helped by a transmission that shifts too soon for my tastes  The shift quality is poor  either it clunks or it slips just a bit  Taurus transmissions are legendary for failure and malfunction  Being that this example only had 72 000 miles made all the less encouraging   Update  As of August 2002 this Taurus blew its tranny with only 76 000 miles  It was soon junked  Sorry it took my almost a year to inform you all of this Handling Steering braking  D So many family sedans of this era had started to become more engaging to drive  The Nissan Maxima and Honda Accord were the sportiest  the Toyota Camry was the smoothest  the Mazda 626 and Nissan Altima being somewhere in between  But Ford tuned the Taurus to appeal to those who consider a car to be just an appliance  The Taurus has perfectly safe handling but the driving experience is numb and devoid of any sense of fun  The steering lacks any sort of feel  It heft is completely artificial  The response is imprecise  The suspension is tuned for a smooth ride but its softness contributes to more body roll than is comfortable  The brakes are horrid  The pedal feels spongy and I had to apply way more pressure than normally do  Overall  this car does not inspire any confidence Interior  D The Taurus was one of the bigger cars in its class  I really expected to be impressed by the interior room  But when I got behind the wheel of the Taurus  I discovered that I have it made in my  93 Mazda 626  My Mazda was one of the smallest cars in the class back then however it has a lot more front legroom than the Taurus  In this car  the wheel arches intrude exactly where I like to keep my left foot whereas my Mazda has plenty of foot room  The Ford s seats provide very little support and are not comfortable even on short trips  This GL model has a power driver s seat but surprisingly has no controls for the all important thigh support  The controls are fairly well laid out and the cupholder design is great IT HOLDS CUPS  Too bad it blocks the low mounted stereo  which has really small buttons  The overall quality of materials is quite bad  The plastic used on the dash and door panels just screams low buck  The fabrics used are not much better  The back seat is pretty roomy but like the fronts  they offer very little comfort and support  And for you skiers out there  the seat does not fold down  Thankfully the trunk is big albeit with a high liftover Exterior  B  As far as looks go the older Taurus was not bad  In late 1985 when the original Taurus made its debut it was cutting edge  The 1992 restyle made it look even better and more upscale  Even today it looks somewhat modern if pretty generic  It s a tried and true styling effort that certainly won t offend anybody  The same could not be said for the 1996 1999 fish face model  which offended many Overall  D It s sad to say that the older Taurus was simply not a very good car  I would like to have thought that given the low mileage it would have driven better  But in reality this babied 1993 model drove pretty much the way my friend s old beat up 1989 model  Just as an example  my 1993 Mazda 626 with 161 000 miles on has not led a charmed life  It was in a major accident once  Yet my  old bruiser  drives way better than the Taurus  It is better built  better engineered and a whole lot more comfortable  Plus its fun and has better resale value  The Honda Accord  Nissan Maxima and Toyota Camry are even better  So I d say skip the Taurus  You ll be glad you did  
Neg, Back in 1997  we purchased a 1993 Ford Taurus Wagon  We purchased the car because we needed a larger car for our family  The car had problems the moment we drove it off the lot  As we were driving down the expressway in our  quot new quot  car  the Oxygen sensors went out  meaning the car would stall out going 65MPH  We called the dealership  and they fixed them  assuring us that the car had been very well taken care of  and this was just a strange coincidence  Well  2 weeks later  the brakes went out  so we got them fixed  Then the head gasket went out  And now the transmission is out in it  We have only had this car for a little over 2 years  and we have sunk more money into it than we had to pay for it even though we had a warranty  I will make sure a mechanic checks out the next car I purchase  and I would advice anyone to do the same     
Neg, There have been two serious problems with the Taurus and Sable vehicles  Mainly  it s the transmission  The AXOD and AXOD E automatic transmissions  Introduced in 1986  these things have apparently been designed in haste It s noteworthy to mention that this same transmission has also been used in Ford Windstar minivans and  I think  in Lincoln Continental sedans AXOD transmissions have been used in Taurus and Sable vehicles from 1985 to 1991  An electronic version  called the AXOD E  have been used in the redesigned Taurus and Sable vehicles from 1992 to 1995 These transmissions have used an aluminum accumulator piston which has been known to crack  Ford s TSB  Technical Service Bulletin  indicates that the aluminum piston must be replaced with a steel one  When the piston goes  the car will not upshift properly  if at all These transmissions do not provide adequate lubrication to the planetaries  The planetaries are a set of orbital gears that transfers the torque from the engine to the wheels  Apparently  the transmission does not distribute enough fluid to those gears that they overheat  They eventually will break down  When the planetaries go  your car will not move  If you were moving when those gears go  you will coast to a stop  This problem has also been indicated by Ford through a TSB This vehicle has also used the Essex 3 8 litre V 6 engine  These engines are notorious for developing problems with the head gaskets  A lot of vehicles in Ford s lineup have used this same engine  like V 6 Thunderbird Cougar vehicles and V 6 Mustangs  Fortunately  these engines are easy to identify  Just pop the hood  The intake plenum  which is a big slab of metal on top of the engine  should have this written on it in big letters   3 8 FUEL INJECTED V 6 There is a TSB which lists replacing the head gasket material with an  improved  version  along with replacing the head bolts with ones that have higher torsion to achieve a tighter compression of the gasket for a better seal  However  there have been reports of leaks even with the improvements  Most leaks seem to occur after flushes of the cooling system Ford s execution of recalls to affected vehicles have been less than stellar  Model years covered are only 1994 and up  Owners of vehicles years 1993 and down are not being honored  Off topic  it has also been commented that Ford has had a reputation for  lawlessness  in comparison to other American car companies in terms of responsibility to their customers in the event that a potentially dangerous design defect becomes known  Ford has been known not to take action in face of these circumstances  The only other company I can think of that is worse in this regard is Kia If you want a second generation Taurus  as they are the best looking Tauruses in my opinion  opt for the 1995 model as they may have the updates applied to them  Also  in addition  get only a Taurus or Sable with the 3 0 litre Vulcan engine  If you wish  get a SHO model  All SHO Tauruses use super reliable Yamaha V 6 engines  and some SHOs use manual transmissions  which avoids potential transmission problems inherent in the AXOD altogether  However  When something does go wrong with SHO cars  they are expensive to repair if major parts are required as parts for SHO vehicles can be difficult to find One way to check the transmission s condition is to check the fluid s condition  If it s cherry red  it may still be good  although the fluid could have been replaced to cover up a transmission problem  If the fluid is brown or brownish with a sharp  dirty odor  avoid the car as the transmission had been overheated  Particularly a concern with cars using the AXOD automatic transmission Check the engine s head gasket condition by checking the oil  If the oil looks murky and light brown  and can even sort of have an appearance like chocolate milk  then avoid the car as the head gaskets have leaked Smell the oil  If it smells burnt  avoid the car  Burnt oil usually means that the engine had been overheated  Overheated engines can develop head gasket problems prematurely  and engines with head gasket concerns to begin with should be particularly avoided in this instance Also  as always  try to obtain all the service papers for the car in order to ascertain how it s been taken care of  as well as to reveal if any major repairs had been done or not  
Neg, In April 2000  I purchased a 1993 Taurus LX Wagon with the V6 engine  My family was growing  and I needed a larger  safer vehicle  I went the way I could afford  It was priced slightly over the Blue Book price  and it was super clean  The odometer read nearly 120 000 miles  but when I test drove it  the Taurus wagon handled well and rode smoothly  It ran quietly  and shifted almost unnoticeably  I was impressed  as was my wife  which was very important I made a  1 000 down payment and financed the remaining  3 700 through my bank  The first monthly payment was due on June 1  2000  Roughly 40 days after the purchase was made  a couple weeks before the first monthly payment was due  I had a problem One morning while pulling out of a parking lot  the transmission slipped out of gear  And it stayed that way  The mechanic told me that when he opened it up  the case was full of shavings  Totally without warning  the transmission had chewed itself up  A remanufactured transmission with a decent warranty cost me  2 100  Add to that over  500 in labor  All for a seven year old vehicle I still owed nearly  5 000 on when interest is added Also  at the consignment lot  the keyless entry code worked  A few months later it didn t  and it cost me  45 to get some guy with a slim jim to open the car for me     
Neg, I have a 1993 Ford Taurus with a V6 3 8L engine  The Ford Taurus is a nice car  It is very roomy for a family of four  There is plenty of trunk space and is a comfortable ride for family trips However  at 50 000 miles the head gasket cracked  Coolant was leaking into the exhaust system causing billowing white smoke to come out of the tail pipe  I opted for a rebuilt engine as purchasing another car was out of the question as a car with a cracked head has little trade in value Now  Ford has increased the warranty for 1994 and 1995 Taurus vehicles with 3 8L engines to 7 years or 100 000 miles  According to the letter  if you have already paid to have the head gasket repaired  prior to the date of this letter  March  2000  you may be entitled to a refund of your repair costs  Obviously  Ford has had lots of complaints and bad press concerning their 3 8L engine  Ann O Neill  director of Vehicle Service and Programs even states that Ford  quot is committed to maintaining satisfying and and long term relationships with our valued customers  and demonstrating that commitment through actions such as this quot  I guess I am not a valued customer as Ford told me that there is no recourse because my model year is 1993  It is a low mileage car as it is now close to 7 years old with 61 000 miles of which 11 000 is on the second engine  My car clearly fit the textbook case of what they were trying to correct with 1994 models As previous reviewers of the Taurus have stated  there is no gray area with rules  only black and white with Ford br br  
Neg, My family had high hopes when we bought our  new  Taurus from the Ford dealer  We thought of the great trips we could it this spacious and quiet car  We learned very quickly  The car was the most unreliable thing we had ever ridden in  When we owned it we went on about six long trips with it  four of those trips it broke down  It is relatively quiet and has a decent amout of space  but those are qualities you tend to overlook as you manuver through the oveflow baggage from the small trunk in an attempt to get out of the car to examine the broken engine  Actually the transmission gave us the majority of the problems  It couldn t handle long trips at all  This car is a lemon and should be avoided     
Neg, I have the misfortune of having purchased one of these vehicles about a year and a half ago  It is a 1993 Taurus Wagon  Top of the line  fully loaded  black and very pretty to look at  Unfortunately  I have only been able to drive the car for about 5 000 miles since I purchased it  First the steering went out  900  next it was the head gasket   1 700  not to mention various other minor repairs  The last tow truck driver informed me that he tows the Ford Taurus more often than any other car and the garage concurred  I was warned that the transmissions often go out in these cars and  alas  that prediction came true yesterday  I have decided to donate the car to charity  I would not recommend this car to anyone br br  
Neg, I bought a used 1993 Ford Taurus in 1997  with about 50K miles on it  From the beginning this car was a black hole with my hard earned money  I spent almost  7000 on this car  and have put almost  3000 into it since  NOT including gasoline  oil changes  or regular maintenance  First it was the neutral positioning sensor that left me stranded on the side of the highway  That cost  180 for one part and 10 minutes of my mechanics time  Then the alternator belt popped off  again leaving me on the side of the road  with about  200 in repairs  Then  it was the radiator  the air condtioning compressor  the fuel pump  and some various gaskets  About 6 months after all those repairs  the spindle assembly in the front left wheel literally flew off my car while I was driving it  I ended up in a ditch  quite shaken up  but very luckily  unharmed  That cost  120 FROM A JUNKYARD NOT THE DEALERSHIP  The dealership wanted  445 for that work  Then  the rack went out along with the power steering pump  and the CV joints  Another  800  I found out from my mechanic that my car was built on a Friday  and that explains a lot  I say I wasted a lot of time and money on this hunk of junk and advise anybody out to buy a 1993 or same model Taurus  keep looking elsewhere  Perhaps I happened to get a bad one out of all of them  but I doubt it  I wish more than anything I could turn back time and NOT buy a Ford Taurus  Buyer beware  Now I have a piece of crud that won t even get me  1000 to put towards another car     
Neg, This is in addition to my August 15th Opinion regarding engine problems  which required the replacement of two engines due to head gasket problems I also noted that the transmission was replaced with 32K miles for 2 000 The Ford company wouldn t pay for the replacement eventhough they were aware of a  quot front piston problem quot  common with the Taurus transmissions  I figured that with a new transmission  tires  engine what could go wrong  I found out today  59K miles  that the transmission must be resealed due to numerous leaks eventhough it has only 27K miles on it  It will cost over 600 00  Also have to redo the power steering also due to leaks as well as replacing the front wheel bearings  So far I have spent over 8 000 in maintenance costs to keep the car going and will probably run another 2 000 if I have the work performed  which I doubt  This has been the worst car I have ever owned and anyone who is considering purchasing a ford should get smart and look at other alternatives that have a much better maintenance record br br  
Neg, I have owned a couple of these 1993 Ford Tauruses and they are great for roadtrips and long commutes  The less options  the better  I hate the transmissions they all go out in the 130k range  look for slips and  quot thunks quot  motor mounts are weak too  especially on the 3 8s  so don t mistake the loud thud upon accelerating with tranny problem  The starters are sketchy and these cars suck when they don t work  as you begin to realize that no one wants it  no matter for how little money if there are electrical or transmission problems  Don t spend more than 2500 for one unless the tranny s been rebuilt or replaced br br  
Neg, First of all I love Fords  I think they are good cars but the 93 Taurus has caused us some trouble  First I bought it about 3 years ago  It has power everything  a good sound system  and a sunroof  But we began to have problems  The 3 8 L Fuel Injected v 6 was a poor engine for a Ford product  We have had problems with both front and rear calibers and the whole brake system  We had to change the rotors  the calibers and of course the pads  But the back brakes were thankfully fixed for free   Car X read the paper wrong  and another problem that they noticed was when the parking brake is set it hangs up on the wheel  So we don t use it seeing it s 300 dollars to fix  But the rotors and all costed 900 to fix  We have also had problems with the starter  changed once  also we have changed the engine once and replaced the motor mounts  The head gaskets broke and air conditioner has stopped blowing cold air   but it hasn t been checked  They were all costly  But other then that I love my Taurus  It has a decent engine with good power and has a smooth ride  The stereo is great and has good bass and the sunroof is good on warm days  The seats our comfortable  with lumbar support  and power everything is good  We also have the keyless entry and the code  I like the Taurus but with all the problems I would stay away from the 93 94 model and get the 96 99 model  
Neg, I just recently bought a used 1993 Ford Taurus  Mind you  this is the first and ONLY Ford I have ever owned  I had the car less than three months when everything started falling apart  First the radiator goes  and then the water pump  Then the driver s side mirror fell out onto the street while driving  Next  a piece of the muffler falls off in my driveway  And finally  the driver s side window won t open  The rear brakes went 6 months after we had them fixed and to top it all off  the molding around the windows inside the car is falling off  This has happened all in one year and the car was fully inspected by MY mechanic the day we bought it  which turned out as an A  inspection  So  needless to say after  1 406 59 later  the car is still developing things wrong or defective  not to mention a nice recall on some of the car s interior parts  which I have to have fixed  UGHH  Can we say HEADACHE  Never will I buy a Ford again br br  
Neg, big mistake buying a Taurus  At almost 80 000 miles the air conditioner went out  soon after that the transmission went out cost me big to get it replaced  I went w  a special kit to fix FORD S mistake If you ask me we should all get a class action law suit against Ford and Sue them Don t buy  If you bought it get rid of IT SOON BTW I have a 85 Toyota Camry w  over 270 000 miles on it with no problem Oh  and the interier is falling apart too nice power and good ride  but not worth the repairs what is the fewer than a 100 words JUNK lt paste gt big mistake buying a Taurus  At almost 80 000 miles the air conditioner went out  soon after that the transmission went out cost me big to get it replaced  I went w  a special kit to fix FORD S mistake If you ask me we should all get a class action law suit against Ford and Sue them Don t buy  If you bought it get rid of IT SOON BTW I have a Toyota Camry w  over 270 000 miles on it with no problem Oh  and the interier is falling apart too nice power and good ride  but not worth the repairs what is the fewer than a 100 words JUNK lt paste gt br br  
Neg, Perhaps  quot junk quot  is too strong a word to describe my 2000 Ford Taurus Wagon  After scanning some of the other Taurus reviews  I may be too harsh  but I honestly cannot recommend this car  I realize that this is not a high priced luxury car  so I guess I can muster two stars considering the car s price range I obtained this car about three months ago  and it has about 2500 miles  From the first day that I drove it  there was a problem with the brakes  Whenever I brake the car usually pulls dramatically to the left  and sometimes it pulls to the right  Like most people  I have a busy schedule during business hours  and it is not convenient for me to make an appointment with the dealer to have this fixed during work hours My next problem is the amount of road noise which gets inside the car  I rent many cars each year  and this car is definitely above average in the noise department  On a recent business excursion it was difficult for passengers in the front seat to hear passengers in the back seat and vice versa  due to the road noise  Again  I realize that this is not a luxury vehicle  but I think Ford could do better I would also like to have a larger gas tank  The sixteen gallon tank should be enlarged to a twenty gallon tank  in my opinion  My car gets about 18 miles per gallon  so with the amount of driving I do  I have to stop for gas about twice a week  I do not think that a larger tank would take much away from fuel efficiency  The fact that the gas gauge takes about 20 minutes to register after the car is filled up took some getting used to  as well There are a number of puzzling aspects about this car  For example  why isn t a third pull out seat standard in a station wagon  I know that it is my own fault for assuming that it would be  but now I am stuck with a station wagon with no third seat  Also  why is the rear windshield wiper not centered  The portion of the rear windshield behind the driver is not reached by the wiper  Why does the cruise control have so many buttons and require two hands to operate  I prefer the simple GM system which only requires one hand  Why is the steering wheel so enormous in the center that you cannot see the instrument panel when you make a turn  Other vehicles manage to provide airbags without obstructing the panel view  Speaking of obstructions  why is the driver s head rest so huge that you cannot see around it  Is it me  or is the road clearance unusually low on this vehicle By this time you are probably wondering how I wound up with this car  This is my company car  and it is the only  quot choice quot  that I am given  I realize that this next annoyance may only apply to other fleet car drivers  but why does Ford throw in a  1000 plus engine upgrade to allow the car to run on ethanol  I live on the east coast where ethanol is not readily available  I am sure that it has to do with some sort of government quota  but I would have much rather had the extra thousand dollars put into something usable I usually like to be more upbeat when writing reviews  so I concentrated and came up with two features I like on this car  There is a nice thin shelf directly under the radio console  I also like the fact that there is a second electronic adapter for electronic devices  although this is somewhat standard now br br  
Neg, I get my Fords for free  I m an insurance adjustor with a large national insurance company  they provide us with a new Taurus when we hit 60 000 miles  I think this will give me an unadulterated opinion of the vehicle I ve had two so far  a 1997 Ford Taurus GL  and a 1999 Ford Taurus SE The major problems I ve experienced with both of these cars is electrical problems  The first one was a disaster  In 60 000 miles  the car went into the shop 14 times for electrical problems  They ranged from interior lights that would not ever go out when the car was on  thus making it dangerous to drive at night   I had to pull the lights under the dashboard and keep the dome light off  to the power steering going out at 75mph right before taking a curve on the interstate  I had the power windows go out  the power locks suddenly lock or unlock as you re cruising down the street  the alternator needed a change  and I went through three computers The second one is quite minor  I currently have 8500 miles on it  and the radio clock keeps blinking on and off as you drive  I ll have Ford look at it next time it goes in for maintenance As far as comfort  this is an excellent car  My office is in my car  and the SE package is very nice  with electric seats  lumbar support  and the remote that locks unlocks the door and opens the trunk is a nice touch   you don t need to set down all your packages  or in my case a ladder that fits in the trunk  to open the trunk   just hold it in your hand and pop it open  then set your things right in it As far as safety  being in the insurance industry and having the company purchase these cars exclusively for its employees should be testimony enough   they have superb safety ratings  They hold up well in crashes  and they do a good job of protecting the passengers Remember one thing though  in the purchase of a Ford product Fix Or Repair Daily I used to think that was just a joke  however  with my experience with the Taurus  that is close to true br br  
Neg, This review is only going to cover the most annoying  quot feature quot  I have ever experienced in a car  I will mention that I love the performance and handling of this car  It s also very roomy and attractive  However  if you want a detailed review of all the aspects of the Ford Taurus  there are plenty of other reviews  just click to the next one in the category This review will simply explain why I will never own one It is my husband s car  provided for him by his company  so neither of us is responsible for choosing this particular vehicle  I have been driving it for a week while he is out of town  I will be more than happy to give it back to him when he returns What is this  quot feature quot  that makes me want to drink gasoline right out of the gas tank  It s a common feature on cars today  the automatic door locking mechanism  When the car reaches 10 MPH  the passenger doors all lock themselves I can see only the slightest  faintest benefit to this  Maybe it will keep your passengers from getting yanked out of the car and mugged and beaten when you pull up to an urban stoplight next to the whores and winos who decorate the corners of your particular hometown  That s the only thing I can think of i b But I do not want a car that decides for me when the doors should be locked i b  You would not believe how often this aggravates me  Any time that I get out of the car and have a need to open one of the passenger doors  I have to remember the extra step of hitting the  quot unlock quot  button   I did not  lock  the door  why should I have to remember to unlock it i  This happens nearly every time I get out of the car because I usually travel with my one year old sidekick who likes to ride in his carseat in the back  In order to get him out  I have to open the back door  Seven times out of ten  I have to  try  to open the back door  then curse and re open the driver door  hit the unlock button  close the driver door and  then  open the back door The gas tank is on the passenger side  So when I m standing over there  filling up  shivering  waiting i ding i  the tank s full  I put the pump away and grab the door handle to open the passenger side door to get my purse so that I can go pay for my gas  Nope  Gotta trot my happy butt around the car  open the driver s side door  hit the unlock button and run back around  or crawl in and reach through to grab my purse Keep in mind  the average temperature is below zero where I live this time of year  The less time that I have to spend dinkering around outside my car messing with locked doors the happier I will be  Not to mention the likelihood of me hitting a patch of ice as I m scurrying back around to the driver s side to unlock the doors and winding up on my bottom So lately  I ve been speaking aloud to this car  and it ain t Christmas carols I m singing when I do  Another annoying  quot feature quot  I have discovered is that the car not only wants to decide when the doors should be locked  but it refuses to shut up about the seat belt  It dings every fifteen seconds if I don t fasten my seat belt  Sometimes I simply do not want to wear it  okay  I m an intelligent grown up  I can calculate risk and make choices for my own personal safety  I do not need the car griping at me about it  This has only forced me to disable this safety feature by fastening the seatbelt and leaving it fastened  sitting on top of it while I drive  Instead of encouraging me to be safe  this car is forcing me to be less safe in protest At the very least  Ford should provide an option for these features  some mechanism to turn them on or off as you desire  I will never buy a Ford Taurus or any other car with these aggressive features  I do not want my car telling me what to do br br  
Neg, This car defines average  There s a reason why it s one of the most widely used cars for fleets  Skim the other reviews and see how many of these people actually own one of these cars  Fleet managers love this car because it is well rated in crash tests  rather reliable and doesn t inspire illegal  surges  in speed  My 2000 is also a fleet vehicle  ours is the second company it has served  HP took delivery of this car first  Now don t get me wrong  I d have driven a used Yugo if the company determined that was what they wanted me to have  I m grateful that we went to a medium sized car  But I do have a few complaints  not as many as I d have if I were forced to drive a used Yugo  The initial visit to the local dealer was interesting  They pulled the service history from their computers and found they had about a dozen recall actions to perform  Oh  things like the fuel pump  pedals too close together  windshield wipers  alternator a whole range of things  I admire Ford for fixing all these things for free  but did Microsoft purchase them  Perhaps the Taurus  it goes through a complete makeover every couple of years  uses the summer intern design teams  I received the car with around 18 000 miles  I m not certain why HP got rid of it so early but I ve a few ideas  At about 75 000 now  the leak started about 20 000 miles ago  Oil is leaking from somewhere in the vicinity of the passenger s side headlight  I ve a slick in my garage to show for it  No one seems to know what it is that is leaking there  It started with an odor of burning oil  No clue and company policy seems to be to leave the car alone unless it s something affecting safety  Uh kay  The ride around town is fine  Stiff enough to give the impression someone on the car s design team knew someone who was once hooked up with someone who designs sports cars  Perhaps with a designer on the Mustang design team  Power is decent but not inspiring  I drive this car up to 3500 miles per month as a salesman for a relatively small company  Long drives to various prospects and clients scattered about Iowa are made less comfortable by that stiff suspension  You can count expansion joints in the road through the seat  steering wheel  pedals  etc  Frost heaves are another thing entirely  For the  16 000 the company paid for this car I could have bought sorry  off topic Handling is also good in the sense that when you turn the wheel to the left the car agrees that is a good direction to go and doesn t fight you in doing it  It is good to obey the posted curve speeds as the tires protest too much if speeds are pushed  The side bolsters on the seats are enough to keep you from finding too many alternate pressure points on your gluteus  and padding thereof  but not enough to keep you firmly centered under hard cornering  The dead pedal is where you d expect it to be if your vehicle is so small as to have the front wheel wells encroach on the passenger cabin  The upholstery is light gray  Stone  Perhaps medium vanilla gray is the best description  The dashboard is laid out fairly well but I think the tachometer was put there to aesthetically balance the speedometer  There are also many  decorative  little nooks and ledges to gather extra road dust  The blower knob no longer sticks where it is supposed to stick  It makes occasional lunges for freedom managing to get as far as the floor  rolling about as far as the center of the driver s seat  It eludes a casual reach so I ve to stop and fish it out to readjust the blower motor  I d much rather have a thermostat but I guess Taurus drivers aren t sophisticated enough for that sort of feature  HP cars have an option that wasn t available to the general public  or so I ve read  The center console can be folded up under the center armrest  I guess so you can have someone in the front as well as the back sit on the nearly rock solid center and  in the front  almost on the driver s lap  Anyway  when this is down you ve two decent cup holders and a place to mount and connect a cell phone  While connected the phone charges its battery   makes use of the car s external cell phone antenna  To answer you press a button above the rear view mirror  The stereo then cuts off and you hear the conversation over the car s audio system  Neat  but the little cradle to hold your cell phone is  450 and specific to each brand  Not that neat  I ll stick to my Jabbra  Normally  according to the owner s manual  where the cell phone mounts in this car is another bin  The center bin is a nice place to keep tapes   whatever other little items you need to keep close at hand while driving  It also collects stray potato chip crumbs  peanut M Ms  etc  Bins are also built into all the doors  You ve also got the large   deep pockets on the front seat backs that are good for holding marketing material  I m not certain what the rest of you use these for  The glove is of the bin variety tipping out at the top  versus tipping out at the bottom and dumping the contents onto the floor  Anyway  it manages to hold the manuals  a bottle of Tylenol  an economy size of Tums and some extra pens  full at that point and difficult to close  I prefer the old style where the glove was fixed with a door rather than this tipping bin  There is an extra power port just to the right of the ashtray  The lighter is directly above and to the right of a totally worthless cubby  Perhaps an engineer designed this  as that matching doesn t really make sense to me  a lowly salesman  About that cubby  nothing seems to stay within other than items too small to make it worthwhile  I have a picture of my wife   I in there now  Under extreme conditions even the picture slides out  Cell phone  Forget it  Just backing out of the drive way sends it skipping to the floor  With two power points I can plug in my phone and my vibrating seat cushion   I do like gadgets that work  I keep business cards in the ashtray  Headroom is very good   even with my seat cushion   in the driver s seat  I haven t spent too much time in the back seat  If that is good or bad you tell me  The general consensus though is that the back seat is a bit cramped  I drove three staff members of a prospective client four hours one way  and back again  and didn t anesthetize the two in the back sufficiently  Combine that with my testosterone induced marathon driving style and I really don t need to tell you we didn t get the business  Next time I ll rent a van or luxury car   perhaps with a wet bar  One interesting feature is the pedal adjustment  Ford  I believe  developed this for those of you who need the seat all the way back to fit behind the steering wheel but then can t reach the pedals  The car has a switch on the left of the driver s seat that runs a motor that moves the pedal assembly closer or further depending upon your starting point and the direction you push the switch  duh  It has quite a range of motion  I ve a 34  inseam and have never had a desire to move the pedals beyond the hour I first brought this car home  This is a gadget I ve no use for  Perhaps it was intended for the one million chimps typing randomly on typewriters to get to work   long arms and short legs  I do like the stereo  For some reason it is able to pull radio stations in for some distance further than my GM cars normally have  Beyond that it is also rather average for sound  The bass doesn t thump  This car also doesn t have the available CD changer  When the CD button is pressed on the stereo the display scrolls  NO DJ  Bless his heart  isn t that just cute  Whatever  The interior sound level is rather nice  No squeaks or rattles to mention  Those are the kind of things that some members of society put other people in the trunk to check for  normally people who owe them large sums of money  They then drive to a remote location and ask them if they heard the rattle too  When they blubber incoherently the driver understandably gets mad and  Sorry  off topic again  I also like the key fob remote   very nice gadget  Press the unlock button once and the driver s door unlocks  Twice and all the doors unlock  Trunk release is very nice when running out to grab this or that  Why do these things occasionally have an  EMERGENCY  button  I ve noticed them on Ford   Chrysler products  key fobs  How many of you accidentally hit it when your neighbor is checking out your car in the driveway while you re inside the house  Can I see some hands  It only works to test the bladder once  The trunk is big enough to swallow most of what I need to carry  You can fold the rear seats down to give you  more room  but it has to be very narrow and short  Skis would fit as well as extra long golf clubs  I don t have either  That s about all that feature is good for except maybe if someone were to carry 8  boards home from the lumberyard  I guess if you need to carry up to four 8  2 x 4 pieces of lumber at a time this would be a good feature  Understand that these boards would selfishly hog all your armrest  too  They d also make quite a mark on the dash if you were to run into something The spare is of the doughnut variety and located under the floor of the trunk  Normally you don t need to access that too often  but I ve had to  Twice  Praise the Lord  both days were otherwise pleasant enough that it wasn t a huge chore  However  there is a six foot long bolt holding the spare in place  Okay  perhaps more like six inches  I normally don t exaggerate length  but it feels much longer while bent awkwardly into the trunk with demo cases scattered behind me  That s the other thing  I didn t care to have the flat in contact with anything that was in the trunk and the donut hole  is that what you d call that  isn t large enough to store a full size flat  Fortunately all that was on the tire was black brake dust and road grime  it s not like I m herding horses with it or anything  I wrapped the tire in the blanket I keep in the trunk for emergencies  Great  now I ve got black brake dust on my emergency blanket  One occasion that prompted a tire change was when I hit a rather nasty pothole and actually punctured the aluminum rim  Not just a bend  It actually tore a hole in it and air was leaking not just from the tire bead but also from the rim  The tire had also had a bad day understand  but not near as bad as that rim  Anyway  I was amazed and began to wonder what a replacement might cost   150   200  no   350  That s  1400 for the set of four  I could get a very fancy set on e Bay for okay  back to topic  The Ford garage admitted that the aluminum rims are rather soft and that s not as uncommon as I would have thought  You know  I didn t even get to keep the old rim  That would have been quite a chunk of aluminum to bring in for scrap  I could have defrayed the cost a bit  eh  Oh  topic  topic  An area most manufacturers cut weight now is on the brake rotors  Someone at HP either rode the brake a great deal or that pothole also bent the rotor  I ve a really nasty shimmy shake when braking hard from Interstate speeds  Not enough to be dangerous of course  but extremely annoying  Fuel economy is disappointing  I d assume and be incorrect that this medium sized car would get better fuel economy than my land yacht  92 Buick Roadmaster  Taurus 23 highway  20 city  Roadmaster 25 highway  18 city  If the difference in comfort weren t so extreme it wouldn t bother me as much  This is also the EVO model engine  It will run happily on  environmentally friendly fuels  I ve only seen one station with a 95  ethanol option and that is about four hours north  I d have expected it to run better on the alternative fuel  but it got the same mileage on the slightly more expensive fuel  The paint  white of course  and exterior finish are well done  I ve noted earlier models that took a bad primer coat and most of the paint has flaked off the hood and roof of the cars  Ford seems to have fixed that issue  I guess what this comes down to is that the Taurus has some design and mechanical quirks without the redeeming factors some other cars possess  If your Ferrari has a stiff ride  you know it s because it s a sports car  If your old VW microbus leaks a bit of oil from strange places  you accept that as part of the vintage  But this  for me anyway  is just too vanilla a car  Update 11 Dec 03   Okay folks  As mentioned above this vehicle has the adjustable pedals  Fine  There is a solenoid on the brake pedal that tells the car when the pedal is depressed  presumably so it can administer valium  Why this is engineered this way is a mystery  but to save thousands of dollars in wire over the manufacturing life of the car the two wires that connect to the pedal are just barely long enough to reach that solenoid when the pedals are set all the way forward to the firewall  When you push the brake pedal when it is set in that far  forward  position  I ve a 34  inseam  those wires bend at the solenoid  Are you following this  Over time copper loses strength when bent back   forth  back   forth    Keep that in mind  I was purchasing food at a local quick service restaurant sitting in front of their drive up window  I d put the car into park as it was taking some time to harvest the potatoes for the fries and kill the chicken to prepare my sandwich  yes  it took that long  When I went to leave I moved to pull the stalk into the drive position  But  since you need to depress the brake pedal to shift the transmission from park to another selection  really not a bad idea  and the aforementioned weakness of copper had resulted in an electrical fault that resulted in the car not being able to know when the brake was depressed  Incidentally  this also handles all the brake lights as well  So  the solenoid no longer was connected to the rest of the system that UN locks the transmission stalk  I can t even get into neutral to push it out of the way of the other folks who want to purchase food as well  Did I mention that it was 5 00 pm  So  it takes 5 minutes to figure out that I will not be able to muscle this into drive or at least neutral  The store manager is leaning out the window making suggestions  Nothing I tried would work  I called my personal mechanic  He d never heard of this happening  we didn t know the solenoid was disconnected  ever  I called a tow   waited for 20 minutes  Now it s around 5 30 pm  did I mention it was Friday night  and the tow truck is trying to hook up to the car  He s never heard of such a thing as this before either  In the wait I ve discovered the wire has disconnected from the solenoid  I ve the tow truck driver hold a flashlight while I attempt to reconnect the wire to the solenoid  In a short time I also discover that the wire is a bit short  I figure this out by reversing my seating position in the car  My feet are up by the ceiling and my arms and head are wedged into the foot well  I manage to push the wire into the solenoid and un wedge myself  Still doesn t work  The tow truck drops my car at my mechanic s garage  he waited for me to get there  Fortunately I ve a good relationship with my mechanic   he s able to squeeze this little project in the next day  He added two inches to both wires  the second wire was about ready to go as well  and now there s a little slack to the wires so they re not strained to the limit  Have I mentioned my food was cold  
Neg, I have owner a Ford Taurus 24V DOHC Six Seater Option  It now has 5000 miles on it and is three months old  Overall I love the vehicle  My previous care was a 1996 Ford Explorer XLT with 150 000  That truck made me a believer in American cars again and the Ford Taurus is no let down  Here are the Ten Best and Ten Worst that I think about my 2000 Ford Taurus Ten Best 1 Excellent Ergonomic Design 2 Great Options  i e  Six vs  Five Seater  Free Leather  Engine Types 3 Very comfortable ride 4 Low road noise from the inside cabin 5 Unnoticeable gear shifting 6 Low maintenance costs  i e  100 000 mile tune up 7 Great highway mileage  I get 25 mpg 8 Enormous trunk space 9 Easy to drive 10 Spacious passenger cabin Ten Worst 1 Low city mileage  16 mpg 2 Not much color combination selection  interior and exterior combinations 3 Floor mats are ordinary  Looks like they got bought in Pep Boys 4 Not very good road handling at high speeds  believe me I know 5 Braking is average 6 Cruise control is a little clumsy  Takes time to adjust to cruise final speed 7 Radio reception below par  standard audio package 8 Closing the trunk require much force 9 No ceiling handles for passengers  Japanese car owners know what I mean 10 Slow pick up for the DOHC V6 24V br br  
Neg, I have had the opportunity to drive several Ford Tauruses through business travel  I have driven both the 1999 Ford Taurus SE and the 2000 Ford Taurus SE First off  I have to admit that I am not a Ford fan and am not in the market for a sedan such as the Taurus  But I have to say that the Taurus would be a decent family car for those who would like to get a decently equipped car for around  20K b Exterior  The design folks at Ford have obviously realized what an  oval all  disaster the last generation of Tauruses were  The oval shape was everywhere  from the headlights  the taillights  the grill and even the rear window  For 2000  the Taurus has moved away from the radical oval design in favor of a some sharper angles which give the car a more elegant look  Most importantly  the ugly mass of oval rear lights have disappeared  being replaced by some simple angular tail lights b Interior  Gone as well inside the car  thankfully  is the large oval climate control   radio combination  Ford still misses the mark by providing a  though more attractive  single unit climate control   radio center  The seats are your typical American car softer and ample sized seats  The power driver s seat allows a good driving position to be found  The rear seats appear to provide plenty of seating space for three adults  including decent leg room  The one interior fixture in the car that I absolutely disliked was the center armrest seat console combination  I just believe that there is no such thing as a true three passenger front seating area  unless maybe you are driving a 1970 Cadillac Eldorado or something  and feel that most car companies do a lousy job at attempting to do so  The largest person that could sit comfortably in this space is about a five year old child  The storage console is one like those overstuffed sectional couches with fold down cupholders  I imagine those who own those type of couches would appreciate this feature in this car  Other than that  the car is well equipped with power windows and door locks  cruise control and a neat control that allows you to adjust the pedals forward and backwards  which is good for really short drivers  My overall impression of the interior was that it had a really sort of modular plastic feel to it  There were places where plastic switch plates were placed on top of the plastic door panels  rather than having the pieces fit together nicely with a minimal seam  But  for 20K  I don t think that there is much to complain about b Driving  I wasn t really impressed driving this car  Sure  it is relatively quiet on the road and the car eats up imperfections in the road  but it is just not a FUN car to drive  But I suppose those who are buying this car are less concerned about this  I though that the 1999 model felt more powerful than the 2000 model  The 2000 model seemed a little sluggish with the standard V6 engine  I have learned that car manufacturers don t offer bigger engines for no reason at all  If you have the extra cash  opt  for the larger V6 engine  Since this car seems to have been designed with a more comfortable ride in mind  the car handles with a bit of a bloated feeling  especially on freeway on and off ramps b Summary  I personally wouldn t buy this car  but like I said  I m not in the market for this type of car  And if I was  I would rather shell out a few thousand more for the VW Passat   Sorry  I am a VW fan  It just doesn t have anything about it that makes me want to buy it  But the rental car agencies seem to like them and there are plenty of them on the road  so some people must like what Ford has turned out with the Taurus  But if you are looking for just a plain old family car  one that has a good safety rating and is decently equipped for around  20K  check out your local Ford dealer br br  
Neg, If you love American vehicles  beware  I  personally  don t care for them  I find Japanese and German automobiles to have better service records  more style  and an overall better feel to them  When renting a car for the purpose of travel  however  an American car is most often the only option  So when I traveled to Connecticut for a week  I had a choice to rent a Ford Explorer or Taurus I chose the Taurus  I wish I had chosen the Explorer I disliked the car from the moment I sat down inside of it  The seats were so uncomfortable  To help illustrate how uncomfortable it was let me paint a picture  My cousin has an old sleeper sofa with flat  worn out cushions  To keep people from sinking to the floor when sitting on the sofa  she has a piece of ply board between the cushions  and you really feel like you are sitting on a piece of thinly padded ply board  That s what the seats in the Taurus felt like  I can t even imagine taking a long road trip in this car let me know when you plan to arrive  and I ll fly out and meet you  I also felt like I was sitting too high up for a sedan  and no matter how much adjusting I did to the seat  I just couldn t get comfortable  The ignition was hidden so far under the steering wheel that it required me to do a deep side stretch just to start the car  And the console controls  i e  radio  A C  defrost  etc  are so far away from the driver  that unless you have the wingspan of an albatross  some major leaning is involved just to find a good song on the radio Speaking of the radio  I had to turn it up really loud to drown out the loud interior noise  Acceleration sounded like the takeoff in an airplane  Now if someone would serve me a light snack and a beverage of my choice while driving to the grocery store I wouldn t mind it so much  but they don t  So I would rather do without so much noise And this tank of a car skids on the snow  Even with all weather snow tires  That was a major disappointment since I sprang for a larger car knowing that I would likely be driving in snowy conditions  The heater took forever to heat up  and the rear defrost took even longer The only positive thing was the roomy interior and trunk  If you plan on taking a driving vacation and want to bring a lot of people and luggage  this is the car for you  But keep in mind they will have plenty of elbow and leg room  It s just that their butts will be sore numb from the horribly uncomfortable seats  If after all of this you decide to buy one of these vehicles  I wish you all the luck in the world  That and a good seat cushion  You ll need both br br  
Neg, I had a Red 2000 Taurus SES as a loaner car for almost 2 weeks  I put almost 1000 miles on it in a combination of city driving and long trips  Overall I was mostly disappointed with Ford s family sedan  but it did have some good points I should mention Pros It was bigger than most  if not all  of the cars in it s class  such as a Accord or Camry  I m over 6 feet tall  and I had plenty of room up front and so did people in the back  even with my seat all the way back  The only car in this class that has as much room is the Chevy Impala   which is an incredibly ugly car by the way The trunk was very large and easily held luggage for 4  Compared to other rental cars I have had  such as a Mazda 626  the Taurus was much better for long trips The steering was great  It was the perfect balance of being communicative yet comfortable  Not as sporty as a Focus or a Mustang  but certainly not a boat on wheels like a Crown Victoria or an Impala Didn t attract attention  I have been known to exceed the speed limit  once in a great while  and I think a Ford Taurus is just about as anonymous as you can get in terms of attention from the Police OK now for the things I didn t like Interior materials  Although the design was ergonomic enough  the dash had too much hard plastic and the switchgear felt like it came from an econobox  I think my Focus has a better quality interior  Also the steering wheel on the Taurus is ugly Seats  The seats were flat and uncomfortable  I did have the bench seat up front  and so I would hope that a model with bucket seats would be better  The car had that  fake leather  on the seats that looks nice for about 10 000 miles then starts to look like the plastic you would find the the backseat of a cab Noise  There was too much wind  engine  and tire noise  For a car that Ford claims was designed in a wind tunnel there is way too much wind noise coming off the side mirrors  I suspect the door seams are sub par  The engine did not sound nearly as refined as you would hear in a V6 Accord or Camry  and when you put your foot down it sounded like it was going to crash through the firewall and end up in your lap  The Taurus I drove had the upgraded engine  and I would hate to think what an owner of a base model would have to put up with on a daily basis Radio   The radio reception was terrible and the speakers were the kind you would buy off the sale rack at Walmart A Taurus has the stigma of being rental and a loaner car  It has no personality whatsoever  nor does it have the quality and reliability you would find in a Toyota  Honda  Mazda  or even a Nissan or a Mitsubishi Don t get me wrong  I am sure there are tens of thousands of Taurus owners who love their cars and are perfectly happy with them  But if you are looking for a car with some character and even a mildly engaging driving experience you are better off in something else  You might pay a little more if you want the same options but it s worth it in the long run  not to mention resale value  
Neg, Buying a Ford Taurus from a used car dealer can be a good thing it can also be your worst nightmare  Buying a 1994 vehicle like the Ford Taurus that was purchased with 80 000 miles attached to it by 1997 my first question would have been whether or not these miles where highway or city or a combo  I m going to bet you the dealer lied  Keep in mind that most used car dealerships buy their cars from auctions at a reasonably lower cost than anyone will purchase them  The warranty is there as a convienence to the customer and the dealers  The dealers can and will set up vehicles to last just long enough  Something as simple as a oxygen sensor will in most cases be overlooked or simply pulled  cleaned  and reinstalled along with other things  Yes it does have room to breathe and the seats are comfortable but room and comfort won t get you where you want to go  Be careful to find the best dealers look for bad and good track records watch out for the quick sell  A vehicle that won t go over 65mph without dying on you would not be in my driveway  I totally agree with anyone who hates their Ford Taurus  A friend of ours had one  it lasted one year  Yes they put more money into this car then what it was worth  The worst mistake they ever did  By the way they no longer have it br br  
Neg, I had a rental Taurus a few weeks ago  I had reserved a Ranger Pickup  but the company didn t have any in  so they gave me a new Taurus  I thought I was getting a deal  but I sure was wrong  Ironically  the rental agent said to me   quot I m giving you a new Taurus  since you have the two babies  I wouldn t want a car to break down on you quot  An omen The car was fine for the first few days  save the awkward placement of the controls and the layout of the interior in general that one comes to expect with most American nameplate autos It wasn t until a rainy afternoon when the car left my wife sit at some train station outside Boston  Wouldn t start  wouldn t turn over  totally dead  The tow truck driver  whom I got to spend about three and a half hours of quality time with as we made our way to the rental car facility at Logan airport  suspected the car failed because it was  quot wet quot I ve never liked Fords  and I used to own one that was an absolute piece of junk  Needless to say  this Taurus hasn t changed my opinion So for your own sake  don t buy this car  Test drive a nice Honda  Nissan  VW  or Toyota  Sure they cost more  but you can drive them when its raining br br  
Neg, I have always hated Fords except for the Explorer which is an amazing car  but I absolutely hate the Taurus so much  It is a waste of room on the Highway  and it baffles me why people buy this car  it always falling apart like a typical Ford sedan does  Who in the right mind would buy this piece of JUNK No I really hate this car  it has no positive feature to it  and to top it off  it is one of the number one selling cars in the country  believe it or not  I dont believe it but it s actually true  I HATE FORDS  i hate them so much  They are terrible cars  dont buy them br br  
Neg, I got my new  blue  Y2K Taurus only 10 short days ago  My previous vehicle was a red 98 Taurus with which I was delighted  Now  I am NOT delighted  While traveling at the speed limit of 70mph  on the interstate in my new vehicle  cruise control on for ticket prevention  I felt a strong JOLT and looked in my rear view mirror because I thought I must have run over something  There was no dead animal  ladder  or D O T  worker lying in my wake  My car was rapidly losing speed  and I turned on the emergency flashers as I made my way to the side of the road  There was sudden apparence that my NEW 10 DAY OLD Taurus had decided to chew its transmission into powder  and refuse to move  Ford roadside assistance was very nice  and the tow truck arrived after dark  The mortally wounded bull was towed to a dealership other than the one where it was born  The surrogate dealership was NOT excited to see the tag of the other dealer still on the back of the vehicle  To say they were less than kind would be an understatement  The made it clear  up front  they would get right to work  in three or four days  if they had time  The new Taurus is a louder ride  with stiffer seats  and in my case  a very unsatisfactory transmission  and that s NO BULL     
Neg, I recently was given a Ford Taurus to drive as my company car until my official car comes in  look for my review of that car when it comes in   either a Grand Marquis  a Ford Crown Vic or a Mercury Sable LS Anyway  I have been driving this for about a month  Its an OK car  but I wouldn t buy it  The interior is nice enough  but it is already beginning to show wear  The seats are comfortable and adjust well  but are nothing great The back seats fold down VERY easily  This provides plenty of room for me to lie my bike in without having to remove the wheels One annoying thing about the car is that the power locks only automatically unlock the front drivers  door via the factory remote  You have to hit the unlock button 2 or 3 times to trigger all the doors to unlock  So if you are driving  park it and turn off the car  when you step out of the driver door all other doors stay locked  Some people may like this  but it really annoys me As for fuel economy   NOT  This thing seems to suck down the gas faster than either my Jag or 4Runner  The car I was given is a very nice shade of blue and  as far as wagons are concerned  the shape is nice Driving the car is easy and it handles fairly well  Overall  it is a fair car  Nothing great  but not bad either  
Neg, Kinda Like the Girl in Pretty Woman  Good Looking  but pretty darn unrefined Face it  the old Ford Taurus was butt ugly  The front lights looked utterly bug like  and the dashboard was so  revolutionary  it was confusing  The new Taurus remedies some of the problems of the old one  as the dashboard is pretty straghtforward  and the body  while not a knockout  is far better looking than the old one  While the car feels solid  at least the doors  The body panelling just has a thin look to it  maybe from cheaper than average paint  And while the dash is far less cluttered than before  one has to think about the designers who thought that rubber plastic looks good  and the little TV style volume markers on the LCD display  I mean  if it sounds loud enough for you  who cares about the little markers When I first got behind the wheel of the Taurus  the steering wheel struck me as a little odd  its smaller than the average steering wheel  by maybe about two inches in diameter  My hands felt closer together than normal on this steering wheel  and while it did nothing to detract from driving it  it was disconcerting at first  The wheel might have been designed for those with smaller hands in mind  but it works for the bigger handed among us too The car does not seem underpowered  but one would not get that impression by listening to the transmission  which is loud  rough  and shifts very loudly  especially when starting up from a red light  When you floor the gas pedal  the transmission will suddenly shift down to first or second  and it makes the entire front of the car very  very  loud as it reaches and passes the 3000 RPM mark  Fortunately  this only lasts a few seconds  however  regular shifting is also quite loud  At least it doesn t shift very much on highway driving  and it rarely  hunts  on winding  hilly  country roads The front seats are comfy  and the footrest is placed just about right for my length of feet and legs  The rear seats are more cramped than other cars in it s class  and they could be less angled  at least in my opinion  The trunk is not small  however it is a tad shallow The pillars behind the rear seat are kinda wide  so backing up is a slight chore if you have to look to the side  for kids  for example  Also  the brake light hump is incredibly large  and it not only takes up a lot of space in the rear view mirror  but it also covers up a lot of the trunk area  so that it is hard to see the edge f the trunk when you look through the rearview mirror  so it is difficult to judge the length of the rear of the car Another unrefined part of this car would be the brakes  These brakes don t kick in until the pedal is most of the way down  and the brakes gradually get stronger so that they are grabby only at the end of the pedal stroke  and even to just slow the car down  the pedal should be pushed nearly all the way to the bottom of the stroke B The Verdict B This car  while not bad  isn t up to the competition  The Camry is a much smoother driver  as is the Accord  However  if you are a die hard American car owner  than this is probably the car for you  whil it might not match the import competition  this car is in many ways still far better than it s Chevy and Buick competition  
Neg, Let me start out by saying that I own a 1994 Ford Escort DX  see my review  that that particular car gets great mileage it s only a 4 cylinder  but considering everything it s been a great car and it s held together very well for all the miles that I have put on it  not to mention the fact that it is a Ford  Fix or Replace Daily  Now on to the 2000 Ford Taurus  I happen to work for local government   I operate this vehicle in the capacity of my job duties  and let me tell you that the 2000 Ford Taurus sucks  First of all it get lousy gas mileage  It has no real power despite being a 6 cylinder car  my little 4 cylinder seems and feels escort has more power and quicker reaction than this vehicle  I mean I have to put the pedal to the floor to get any real reaction out of this car and then reaction is slow and jerky  The brakes are noisy    not because the brakes need to be repaired it s just that the car just makes a lot of noise  The body and the look and the feel of this car is just yucky  It s very noisy  Here s something positive that I can say about this car  it holds the road well  and the seats are sort of comfortable  So I wouldn t say that I would not totally not recommend this car  but I would say buyer beware  
Neg, This vehicle was a nightmare  My wife and I bought this car in June and it is falling apart  So far  now at 5300 miles  the following has had to be replaced Wheel bearings Wheel mount Struts Fuel pump Brake rotors and pads They have also worked on the driver s side window mechanism and the engine  The car still makes the rotational grinding noise and popping when in a turn or over a bump  We bought this to replace an older car so we would spend less time in the service department  but look what happened  Save your time and money and purchase any car that is not made here in the US  Our quality of workmanship is horrible in US factories  Caveat Emptor   
Neg, I would have to agree that the ownership of the Ford Taurus was not much fun  I had one for a few years and rarely drove it  Yes  it was a comfortable car  but it had so much problems  I ll tell you what kinds of headaches this car has caused  Until it s ultimate death at just a little over 100 000 miles  I ve had the front brake rotors replaced twice  an engine that overheated 3 times  electrical shortages  a whining and moaning steering rack  and the unbelievable  the subframe on which the engine is assembled fell to the ground  Of all the monstrosities of owning an unreliable vehicle  as my brother was driving it one day  he noticed that the steering locked while in motion  He hit a pothole and discovered that the engine suddenly fell on to ground  I ve never heard of such a thing  It really did happen  Being already out of warranty  we went to a local Ford dealer to see if this is normal  It turns out there was a recall on the subframe connectors or mounts  They fixed it for free  minus a  quot Metallica quot  CD one of the mechanics decides to steal from the back seat  I couldn t prove it  After a while  the Taurus developed this engine surge at all rests  either at a light or stop sign with the brake pedal applied  It was unexplainable to a mechanic  so we tried to live with it  Eventually  the surges would increase in intensity and eventually stall the motor  It s eventual demise came when I took a road trip to Florida from NY  On my way back to NY  it decided to finally die  The transmission blew at 105 000 in the middle of Virginia  In the meantime  my brother and I had to hitch a ride back to the NY  Not much fun     
Neg, I purchased an 89 Ford Taurus new because I fell for the hype  quot Best selling car in American quot  THAT DOESN T MEAN A THING except a lot of people were deceived by the numbers  I ve had expensive repairs all along and visited web sites that say Ford knew of the bad transmission  just spent  3 000 for a rebuilt one 6 months ago  when they were building the car  They even have a site with a lawyer suing the company  There are many  many people like me  Now I am faced with another  1 700 to fix the head gasket valve and engine mounts  I want another car but can only spend  8 000 for a used car  Don t talk yourself into a car before you do your homework and be practical about the car br br  
Neg, I personally do not own this vehicle  but my in laws do  After listening to all the complaints about this truck that my in laws have  I felt compelled to write an Epinion about it  My in laws do not reside in any one State  they are constantly travelling  so they accumulate  many  miles on their vehicles  Keep in mind that this truck has not been in the shop only in Utah  but in several states  sometimes more than once in the same State  The following review will be based on my father in laws opinions and experience with his  Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat   written in question and answer form DnDn4kidz   quot Why did you purchase this particular truck  the Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat  Father In Law FIL from here on out   quot We bought the Ford because it was the only truck that met all the specifications we were looking for  including full size rear doors  We ve never had any trouble with any of the other Ford vehicles we ve ever owned  and figured we would not have any problems with the  Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat  quot DnDn4kidz   quot What do you like about this truck  and what do you not like quot this list will be long lt g gt FIL   quot We like everything about this truck  except the mechanical failures we have experienced  We like the looks  the comfort  and every other aspect  The mechanical failures we have experienced have considerably overwhelmed the details we like about this truck quot DnDn4kidz quot What have been the problems with the Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat  quot FIL quot Where do you want to start Hehe Within the first 1000 miles we drove this truck  the transmission and the after cooler on the turbo failed  Within the first 15 000 miles the steering box and the brakes failed  losing complete control of the truck  The torque converter in the transmission broke within 20 000 miles  The transmission failed and the torque converter failed again  a second time after  Ford   fixed  them  Several times we have lost all the gauges  which are electronic  to include fuel gauge  speedometer  tachometer  overdrive on transmission fails  etc  If you lose the power steering fluid  like when the steering box broke  you can no longer steer   nor  stop the truck  because the fluid is all in one column  We continue to experience these same problems over and over quot DnDn4kidz quot What does the dealership do about these problems quot FIL quot The dealership in Utah where the truck was purchased  continues to fix the problems within a timely manner  but the problems continue to occur  But  for  43 000 you would expect to be purchasing a vehicle that did not  need  to be in the shop every other week or so it seems quot DnDn4kidz quot Why don t you turn it back in as a  lemon quot FIL quot The  law  in Utah states that a vehicle can not be considered a lemon until the same problem has occurred at least four times within 12 months  or unless it has numerous safety failures  The next time one of these problems occur with our truck  we will be able to turn it in as a lemon  If we have one more major problem with this truck  we re turning it in and buying a Chevy quot DnDn4kidz quot Aside from all the mechanical failures  how comfortable is this truck to ride in quot FIL quot Well  it would be a lot more comfortable if we weren t constantly worrying about something breaking  The front and back seats are all extremely comfortable  There is plenty of leg room for short or tall passengers  and plenty of head room quot DnDn4kidz quot Aside from the constant worry of something breaking  how is driving this truck  Could someone such as myself  who has never driven a big truck only my bus van lt g gt  drive this truck quot My FIL is  not  much taller than myself  so if he can drive it  I m sure I could hehe FIL quot Oh  it s easy to drive  When everything is functioning properly  it s an excellent vehicle to drive  It takes a barnyard to turn it around in  because it s a huge truck  but you have to expect needing a lot of area to turn such a large vehicle in quot DnDn4kidz quot How does it tow quot My in laws own tow a trailer FIL quot It tows it s maximum allowed towing rate with no problems or lug on the engine  With the size  towing capacity  and deisel engine it can tow about anything you would want to tow quot DnDn4kidz quot Would you recommend the  Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat  to anyone  if so  who quot FIL quot I would recommend this particular truck to my brother in law hehe but nobody I actually like  I would recommend another Ford truck similar to this one  but not this particular one  We would even purchase another  Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat  and try our luck with it  but we think  this one  that we got is a lemon  and someone on the manufacturing line had to have been on drugs  We know several people who own  Ford F350 Crew Cab Dual Wheel Lariat   who have not had any problems with thier truck  we just got  lucky quot Personally  I do not know what any of the following  specs  mean  but based on the above  interview  with my father in law  it sounds like over all this would be a good truck  that he would highly recommend  but just not the one they got stuck with  The  recommend to potential buyers  is a yes  and  no response  He would recommend this truck  but beware  you may get stuck with a  lemon

Neg, I m a commercial Industrial HVAC service tech  The company I work for has quite a few Ford E 250 vans ranging from 1994 to 2001  I ve driven all including the  98 s  however my personal company vehicle is a  96  All vans are nearly identical First I ll start out with the good points The engine in my  96 E 250 is a 351 V8  not the Triton  This engine provides plenty of power in all situations  Acceleration is excellent and I have no problem burying the 85 mph speedometer  I would estimate top speed is around 100 mph In nearly 6 years 70 000 miles this van has NEVER failed to start on the first turn of the key whether it s 10 degrees below 0 or 110 degrees in the shade  So far no repairs other than regular maintenance have been done to the engine Gas mileage is excellent for this big loaded down van and with the large fuel tank I can go several days between fill ups The silver exterior paint clear coat finish is excellent  The van stays outside year round and goes into many hostile environments such as steal mills and construction sites yet after a quick wash looks new Cargo capacity is good  I have the dealer installed shelves and cabinets and there s still plenty of floor space for big equipment  I also believe the height of the cargo area is better than most other makes Very little wind noise The power steering is easy and quiet  The high back reclining bucket seats are very comfortable and durable  The heater is great even on the coldest days and the air conditioner does a really good job on the hottest days  The 4 speaker stereo sounds sweet  All accessory controls are clearly marked and easy to get at The dash layout is great  Speedometer  trip meter  fuel gauge are all easy to see  There s also temperature  oil pressure and volt gauges Now for the bad We ll start off with the minor stuff The styling yeesh  If you sent this van back to 1976 it would fit right in and wouldn t turn a single head Dash controls are cheap  To get the windshield washer to activate I have to hit the stalk hard several times  The plastic end of the gear select column  where the overdrive button is  was always flimsy and the stalk eventually broke off revealing wires and a small circuit board  also happened to one of our newer vans  Epoxy took care of that problem  The cup holder wore out quickly and the single thin plastic tab that actually supports your drink broke off for me today sending my bottle of Sobe into the storage compartment under it  The doors fit nicely  however the weather stripping on the bottom rubs the center of the rocker panel enough so that a 1  section of paint wore off  Applying new paint doesn t help much as it eventually wears off in a few months  Now I just keep it clean and waxed otherwise rust begins to appear  This has happened on both the drivers and passenger sides Dome lights don t turn on when side and rear doors are open The 4 speed electronic overdrive transmission has not been the greatest  The engine provides enough power so that the transmission never has to  hunt  between 3rd gear and 4th  overdrive  something that plagued my previous  88 E 150 I have however had problems with it sticking in 1st gear on hot days  Had several trips to the Ford dealer and they never did find the problem  Also the Parking Pawl inside the transmission broke while parked on a steep driveway as I was pulling equipment out from the back doors of the van  Luckily I had the parking brake on which slowed it down enough for me to get out of the way and then chase it down and hop inside before it made it to the street  Van had 6K miles at the time  Dealer repaired the transmission and parking brake under warranty Yes the parking brakes should have held the VAN Now for the big disappointment The suspension on this van is completely useless  With the cargo area empty it drives fine  Load it up and watch out As I said before I have the dealer installed shelves and cabinets  There is more storage space on the drivers side than the passenger side due to the two side doors so of course there will be more weight on the drivers side  This van cannot handle an average load let alone an unequal load  Loaded down with test equipment  tools and parts the van handles like a PIG  The increased weight in the rear causes the front end to lift up which throws the geometry way off  Having that little extra weight on the drivers side causes the van to pull hard to the right  If you follow behind the van you can literally see it dog tracking down the road  Needless say front tire life is pathetic  at best 12K to 15K miles before the insides are worn to the threads and cupped  Rears wear even but suffer from cupping too  Lower ball joints completely gave away at 52K miles  Ford had some kind of good will warranty on these but wouldn t honor it past 50K miles To try and solve these problems every van at the company was equipped with Air Lift bags  Each bag has an individual air line so that the back can be leveled off perfectly  Then the van is sent to a frame and suspension shop where the front end is aligned with special cams while the cargo area has its usual load This expensive solution eliminated the hard pulling and dog tracking while greatly improving tire life  It still handles like a pig and the ride is a little rougher though In case there s any doubt I d like to mention these vans are NOT even close to be OVERLOADED  I personally think Ford designed these vans more like trucks trying to give them a car like ride when empty  Unlike a truck a service van is a garage office on wheels and always loaded down  
Neg, I own a Ford Econoline E150 1998 model conversion van  I like the quality of the van as well as all the convenient features such as cruise  cassette  air  ABS  etc  However  I was surprise to discover after I purchased the van that one safety feature is missing  That is the Door Ajar warning is not included as standard  So  there is absolute no warning if one of the doors is not shut tight  I can not believe the van with all the standard features does not have this important and basic feature  So to the prospective buyers of this van  make sure you check that feature and ask for it when you buy it br br  
Neg, When we purchased this vehicle  what sold me was the way that it handled  I was afraid it was going to be like driving a bus but it handles like a car  We wanted a car that seated more than just 5 because we have children and the older ones are getting BIG The first complaint I had was the back bench  There s just no headroom  And when I say   quot NO HEADROOM quot  I mean that my 7 year old fits the seat just perfectly  Her head is just about touching the top We are very good with preventative maintenance but after a year of regular driving  we started to experience problems with the vehicle 1  When we were idle  the car would rumble and sound like it was going to cut off 2  The vehicle actually cut off a few times for no apparent reason 3  My ABS light would go on and off We took the truck to the Ford dealership several times before the warranty ran out throughout the first three years but they never found anything wrong  Now that the warranty has run out  three years after purchasing a brand new vehicle  the truck runs like an old  used  chevy truck  It s not bad  but I expect better quality  reliability and service br br  
Neg, In December of 1994  I was 16 years old  I was a newly licensed driver  and was looking for a car that was economical  reliable  and most importantly  safe  The 1994 Ford Escort seemed to fit the bill perfectly The car I picked off the lot was a four door model  The color was bright  neon green   The correct name of that specific color was  quot Calypso Green quot  Such a color really appealed to my teenage self at the time  It did not include many options  but it did include air conditioning  cassette player  and power mirrors  When I pulled of the car lot with it  I was a happy camper One day  about six months later  the trouble began  I had been driving the car all day  and it had been running fine  I stopped at a store for a few minutes  When I came back out again  it simply would not start  When you turned the key  nothing happened  No sound  not even a click  My brand new car was towed back to the dealership and was discovered to have a dead cell in the battery  The battery was replaced  and all was well again At about 15 000 miles  from under the hood came a loud  annoying chirping noise  As it turned out  the fan belt was frayed and needed to be replaced  It was found to be odd that the belt had gone bad at such low mileage  Upon further investigation  the pulley that operates the fan belt was found to be defective  Both the pulley and the belt were replaced A few months later  at about 20 000 miles  the car would not start again  Once again  it took a ride on the tow truck to the dealer and was found to have a defective ignition module  Luckily  the warranty was still in effect  because that would have been the most costly repair of all  about  500 600 The car is in pretty good running condition now  and I hope all of the kinks have been worked out  Currently  the speedometer cable makes an extremely annoying chirping noise at low to moderate speeds and the temperature gauge does not work If I could go back in time  knowing what I know now  I would not have bought this car  I can only hope that others have had a better experience than I have br br  
Neg, Bought this car new in 1994  at night  in a snowstorm  I thought I was getting a champagne colored vehicle  But when I picked it up  it was a horrible pinkish bronze color  Has to be the ugliest color Ford ever used What do I love  It was cheap  It s got 70  on it and still runs pretty well  I ve recently had to replace broken springs  struts  brakes  rotors  and the exhaust system  but until now  other than an electrical problem  below  it has only needed oil  gas and tires  The guy who recently worked on it said  quot you must really love this car quot  To be honest  if I could afford it right now  I d give it to the kids and get something nicer and which had a quieter ride Early on  I had a lot of trouble with the cooling fan rotor burning out  Then the radio would come on when the car was shut off  The fan rotor burned out three times before the dimwit mechanics at my dealership finally figured out that it was a faulty ignition  which never really shut off  Once the ignition was replaced  the electrical problems ceased  So if you think your car is possessed  have the ignition checked I wouldn t buy another one just because I m ready to move on  Our first Escort  81  was a fiasco  We only bought another one because it was cheap and the dealership is close by br br  
Neg, A few years ago while I was doing an internship in Los Angeles  moving from place to place  generous volunteers who d put us up for a few weeks each  I rented a white Ford Escort to load all my stuff and drive to a few places  It was the cheapest car they had for rent  and I didn t have much choice  as only one rental place accepted drivers under 21 years old to rent their cars  the surcharge and insurance are ridiculous First  the car looks okay  It reminded me a lot of my dad s old 1991 Ford Taurus  especially the sloped front and the sloped headlights  In fact  it s like a  quot mini me quot  version of the Ford Taurus  Visibility is great all around  and I sat high enough on this car to be able to see everything around me  The stereo  cassette player  was pretty terrible  I had the windows rolled down on the freeway and listening to the radio at almost full blast and the distortion was awful to listen to  I could have rolled up the windows  it s L A  smog central  after all  but I like driving with the windows down  The car felt solid though  and I didn t feel unsafe in it at all  except  read below The interior is intuitive  The gauges and controls are where they belong  Nothing annoyed me  which is a good thing  The seats were a bit too firm  but then I didn t buy this car and had to live with it I had the 2 door model  and I loaded a lot of stuff in that car  I was impressed by the space in this  quot subcompact quot  car  The drive was what I expected  not spectacular  but enough power to not get blown away on the freeways  This is definitely a great  quot point A to point B quot  kind of car with great fuel economy  I think I got a few days of driving off a quarter tank of gas  and I drove a lot too Now  the most annoying thing about this car is the automatic seat belts  I never understood this stupid invention  It works like this  The across your chest part of the seat belt is actually  quot buckled quot  by default  and when your get in the car  it stretches between you and the steering wheel  When you close your door  the part that is attached to the door frame  quot slides quot  back to the pillar next to your seat  And then you re supposed to buckle up the lap part of the seat belt yourself  Now did you catch the stupidity of that concept  Let me explain  if you re making  quot automatic quot  seat belts  the stuff should automatically buckle itself up with no help from you  Instead  it s  quot half automatic quot  you have to buckle the lap belt yourself  otherwise you re not doing yourself any good  it s like not wearing belts because you say your car has airbags  Another point  if you happen to get in the car  close the door and realize that it wasn t shut tight  and then you open the door and close it again  the seat belts slide back and forth and back upon every door movement you just made But the real gripe I have about this concept is that I am an injured victim of such brilliant invention who lives now to tell you about it  albeit with some permanent war scars to show for it  You see  the first thing I do when I get into a car  without any nanosecond of thought  is to put on my seat belts  Always  even if I m just backing out of my garage 15 feet to wash my car  yes  I m that anal  So naturally  I get into this car  close the door and immediately reach for the seat belts  Whoah  The belt isn t back there  Oh no  Here comes the belt  Sliding into position like a roller coaster out of control  Bam  My fingers are caught on the rails as the belts slide into the pillar  OOOOOOOOOOOuch  It takes a good second or two to realize what just happened  and then a loud scream and other profanities lurching outward from my mouth  and then I realize that I ve been attacked by the seat belts  I quickly open the door  and the thing backs off  taking a good chunk of ectoderm  skin  with it  I m bleeding  A lot  Blood everywhere  Not as bad as the brains in the movie Pulp Fiction  but pretty bad  Now how do I explain this bloody shirt to my boss   quot Uh  my car attacked me quot And you know what s sad  I did it again a few days later  even after spending a good meditative chanting session  telling myself that I will wait two seconds for the belt to do its thing before moving any part of my body  Yes  twice  Same bloody mess  This thing is dangerous So as you can figure  if a car has automatic seat belts  I get no where NEAR that car   quot Thanks for offering me a ride  but I ll take the bus instead  On second thought  can I ride in your trunk  It ll be much safer for me back there quot  This stuff should be outlawed  Anyone know who invented this thing  The inventor needs to have his her patent revoked and be subject to having his her fingers caught in the rails of the belts AT LEAST two times  Sheesh br br  
Neg,  A fter the Ranger was transformed from a large midsized truck in the 60s and 70s to a relatively small truck in the early 80s  it s been on one of the best selling trucks in its class  Good price  good looks  and a wide array of engines have contributed to the current Ranger s success   Engine b  For 2002  there is not too much new in the drivetrain department  The base engine is a 135 horsepower DOHC 4 cylinder available in the XL models  The next engine up is a 150 HP powered 3 0 OHV V6 engine   the one in my test truck  The 3 0 is available in the XLT  XLT 4 wheel drive  the  Edge  4  wheel drive  The top of the list is a 4 0 liter engine which produces an impressive 207 horsepower  This is just an optional engine that will set you back around 800 extra dollars  All engines are either matched with a 5 speed manual or a 4 speed automatic  The test truck was an XLT 4x4  3 0 liter  automatic  Dressed in black clear coat metallic  with tan cloth interior i Driving Impressions i   Entering the vehicle  was easy enough  test truck had a lift kit  and very large meaty tires  but there was no problem getting my fanny into the seat  When the key was turned  the OHV 3 0 liter engine came to life without hesitation  At low Speeds the 3 0 has enough torque  185lb ft  for quick low speed  acceleration   but entering the freeway   and trying to get up to 70 mph is a whole different story  This truck equipped with the OHV 3 0 and a 4  speed automatic begs to be driven slow  Hills are this truck s worst enemy  With cruise control set   70 MPH  this Ranger would down shift into 3rd with even the slightest incline  Engine noise was louder than expected  and at 70 MPH this truck cruised at a little over 3 000 RPM   Handling  is good enough  not sports car material of course  but I was surprised that I could keep up with small cars while driving through the  Avenue of the Giants  The XLT 4x4 3 0 can tow up to 3 800lbs I have taken other years of the Ford Ranger off road and it does fairly well  not as well as the Toyota Tacoma which seems to have a better 4x4 system  however is adequate accomplishing off road tasks i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  is not Lexus material  but then again this isn t a Lexus nor is is made to be even close  The interior of the XLT 4 wheel drive came with excellent ergonomics  driver and passenger airbags  60 40 split bench  a tachometer  very supportive  and comfortable seats  There is plenty of room in the front and rear for small adults  There was a very clear sounding Ford produced stereo system  Power everything  a factory installed alarm  and many other options that can be had depending oh how large your wallet is   Ford com  has all the info you could need on optional and standard equipment i Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior  looks pretty much like it has since 1997  There is a new grille for the 2002 model year  The Ranger seems to get a different styled grille every other year or so to keep the style fresh  The 2002 XLT Ford Ranger truck is very masculine and handsome despite its small package  There is a XLT FX 4 package available that will give this truck a more rugged appearance  huge tires  and Bliston shocks are also added  The  price  for an XLT 4x4 is around  20 000 fairly loaded  With every amenity available  The XLT can run for nearly  23 000  The 3 0 OHV is a proven engine  it has been in cars and trucks since 1986  so reliability is probably good  but I can t comment personally on this particular model year   WWW  CONSUMER REPORTS ORG  has more info i Conclusion i The 2002 Ford Ranger represents an excellent value  however the more competent competition offered from Toyota makes this truck less desirable  If you are in the market for a work truck  I d go with a Tacoma or a full sized Ford F 150 which offer an even more impressive package Looking for a slightly larger truck  You may want to check out    a href content 53380157060  my review on the 2002 Ford F 150 a    Happy Car Shopping  
Neg, I am writing this because of a difficult experience I am having with the Ford Ranger pickup truck I recently purchased from Peyton Cramer Ford  in Torrance  California  After this involvement with Ford  I will never buy from or recommend Ford Motor Company for the duration of my car buying days The reason for my dissatisfaction with Ford is a result of a mechanical problem with my truck that has not been repaired  In short  the truck has an extremely rough  sporadic shake in idle  I returned to the dealership with the Ranger the day after I purchased it and I spoke with the service manager  He acknowledged the problem  and advised me the shake could be caused by water in the fuel line or carbon in the engine  and to bring the truck back after five hundred miles if the shake did not go away  After five hundred miles  I brought the truck back to Peyton Cramer where it was serviced  Another service manager  advised me the CAM timing  pertaining to the California Emissions System  was the cause of the shake  and it was a normal condition of the vehicle  I was not satisfied with the diagnosis so I took the car in for servicing with two other Ford dealerships and received two different diagnoses for the shake  I left both dealerships without a repair and contacted the General Manager of Peyton Cramer Ford  about my situation  After speaking with Howard Herman  I brought the truck in for servicing at Peyton Cramer  and left a second time with this issue being unresolved  I contacted the Ford customer service hotline   they are helpless  and I was told to contact my dealership again  and the regional office  So I did I get a call from the Ford Regional office in Los Angeles and they said they are reviewing their records and that they have determined that Peyton Cramer Ford could not replicate the problem with my Ford Ranger and that it is a normal working condition of the truck  This is after I brought it to the dealership four times  every time the dealership  Peyton Cramer Ford  acknowledges the shake  accepts the vehicle in for servicing  and then after not being able to find the problem  denying that there is a problem in the first place I have yet to determine the real problem  however  I brought my truck to two independent mechanics  These mechanics were able to evaluate and judge that there was a problem with my truck by taking a visual survey of the truck shaking  Both have stated and recommended that there is problem with the truck and to take it back to the dealership where it was originally purchased  I am completely dissatisfied with my Ranger  not only because of its mechanical problem  but also because of the great inconvenience and frustration I have suffered due to Ford s lack of responsibility  The truck s condition is below the reasonable expectations of a new owner ALWAYS TEST DRIVE FOR AT LEAST 15 20 minutes on various road conditions  even with a new car  If you do end up getting a Lemon  Ford will tell you to eat it b To see more problems with Ford  search the internet with the words  Ford Secret Warranties b This review tends to focus on the negative aspects of the Ford Ranger  If I didn t have the mechanical problem with this truck  I might be happier with it s overall performance  Before I bought this Ranger  I had an F 150  When I moved to Los Angeles I decided the F 150 was too big to be driving around a city  so I went for the Ranger  The maneuverability and size convenience is there  and I lowered my car payment  easy to park and move around on the smaller streets  The ride is a bit more smooth than the F 150  however if you do hit a bump the ranger tends to bounce around a bit  I have noticed that with all the Fords I have driven   I have owned three in my life  Taurus  F 150  Ranger  I am a larger person  so I have been a bit squished in the Ranger  If you go with this truck make sure it has power windows  because it s hard to drive and roll up the window at the same time  Also make sure you get the Supercab with the four doors  it makes all the difference in getting in and out of the back seat  However if you have kids or carry people around in your backseat frequently  I don t recommend this truck because of the way the seats face sideways with your back to the outside  If somebody was sitting in the back  and there was ever a side collision  the people in the backseat could loose their spines  I don t carry many people often  so I just use the backseat for carrying extras and locking things up in the car I have also found that the gas mileage is lower than what is reported on the sticker  It truly gets about 16 18 mpg rd hwy  If you go to the message boards on Edmunds com  you can see this is a repetitive problem with the Rangers The engine power I feel if fair  I have a 3 0L  I can make it up a hill without downshifting most of the time  however it does not accelerate well uphill  My F 150 had the smaller engine  and could not make it up a hill in fifth  I always had to downshift so that I would not loose speed Beside the constant earthquake in my car  and the fact that the Ford Customer Service reps and my Dealer have shafted me  the Ranger LOOKS very pretty  I have silver  Good Luck in buying this truck  
Neg,  The Beginning  I thought the poor 1992 Ford Taurus could use a good review  Though  unfortunately  I don t imagine many people will be calling this car  good  in the end  through my experience  No  this car isn t mine  It s my father s  He got it to replace the 1986 Dodge Aires he got to replace the Ford Tempo  even before the poor Tempo Burst into Flames   See my review on that for an even worse horror story My dad had serviced the car throughout its existence  even though he hadn t previously owned it  Dad s the head mechanic at a Sunoco Ultra Service station  knows many people around the area  and has access to many good deals when people wish to sell their cars  Though he knew what problems Taurus  can have  he knew the history of the car  and had taken good care of it  as had the previous owner  Despite having 120 000 miles on it  it was all highway miles  as it had been driven about 50 miles each day to work and back  And furthermore  it was chosen before for comfort  something the Dodge Aires lacked  So  he sold the Aires  and got the Taurus  hoping for a better ride  more power  more comfort  more cargo space  and more features  That much he got  but  he got a lot more with it than he bargained for   Equipment and Features  The 1992 Ford Taurus Wagon we got should be considered a near luxury car  in my opinion  So much more than anything else I ve owned  really  to that point  Of course  I didn t really own it  Dad did  but I drove it an awful lot  The Six Cylinder 3 8 Liter engine is in actuality a Ford Eight Cylinder engine with the last two cylinders chopped off  The design for the eight cylinder was about forty years old at the time of its manufacture  if not a bit older  Six cylinder engines are supposed to be inherently stable  but because of the nature of this engine  its not  To make the engine stable  they added a balance shaft to it  and mounted the engine on liquid filled rubber  Unfortunately  these mounts were horribly easy to break  it turned out  There were attempts to use the Taurus as a Police car that failed because the engine would so easily rip off the mounts  and the car in general was not durable under such stress  Fords of this era had good computers  but they couldn t be really be accessed with any ease  Even my 1985 LeBaron s computer could easily be accessed with a simple hook up  GM and Chrysler share a common link  to which a small computer can be attached  and all sorts of data be derived  To fix an electrical problem on a Ford  or get any information from the computer  the process is much more complex  involving electro voltage meter things  And up until recently  all Fords were like this  A big pain Even so  there was lots of information available in the car anyhow  thanks to the Digital Dash feature  and the accompanying computer that came with it  From miles per gallon at any given moment  how long until you ll need to refuel again  to MPH averages  the computer is a nifty thing  Plus  I adore digital dashes  even if this one s green screen is hard to read during the daylight   My LeBaron s is easy to read in daylight The engine is stable in the end  though  and gets decent milage for the size of the car and engine itself  18 MPG city and 28 Highway is what s on the sticker  and I average around 20 miles per gallon with the thing  However  our engine has been replaced with the 1996 model  thanks to the older one needing to be rebuilt  well  see the next section for that  It should be about the same  though     http www fueleconomy gov feg noframes 9151 shtml   The Transmission is rather good  thankfully  The four speed has overdrive features as well  and I ve never experienced a problem here  It seems sound enough all on its own  It easily powers the car to a quick speed with little trouble  and there s never a real lack of power from that 3 8 V6  Though  I m afraid to use it  for fear of damaging the poor thing The Rack and Pinion power steering feels more floaty than my other cars  with less feedback  Its not necessarily a bad thing  and does give a fair amount of feedback in the end  its just easier to turn  Though  after 120K miles  it is a bit weaker than I d like  There have been a lot of problems with it  though see the next section for that The interior is spacious  with 1003 cubic inches  or 83 5 cubic feet for passengers  The luggage volume is 463 cubic inches  or 38 6 cubic feet  which can be made much larger if you fold the back seat forward  The Taurus Wagon can reasonably carry very large things in its spacious rear  and has been used successfully as such for some time by us  There s a series of useful hooks in the back  too  to make sure things stay in one place The driver s steering wheel contains an airbag  and there s another for the front passenger as well as an option  The car got four stars for driver  and five stars for passenger crash test ratings     http www nhtsa dot gov NCAP SList cfm vehyear 1992 vehmake Ford vehmodel Taurus   The version of the 1992 Taurus Wagon we got was filled with all the best features  Exterior wise  there was the roof rack  the 15 inch alloy wheels  no hubcaps  just the pattern there  and a nice classic light blue paint with dark grey highlights  The antenna is mechanical  and adjustable from the inside  Additionally  the front doors have keypads for keyless entry codes to unlock either one door  or all doors  depending on the code Inside  the first noticeable thing is the leather seats  Even with all the use they ve gotten  they re all in wonderful condition for being ten years old  And they are comfortable  with electric adjustment for both front bucket seats  and even air bladder along the lower back The dash is vinyl all along  and if taken care of  won t split  Unfortunately  ours did  when we forgot to keep it all shiny and nice  Oh well  Its not really noticeable  but its annoying  The floor matts are original  and hold well on the clean fuzzy floor  too The shifter is located between the center consol  and drink holders  Unfortunately  the light died in there  and one can t see if one is in park or drive at night  But otherwise it works well  and I can easily go by feel  Its stiffer than most  and the handle is a firm rubber which is easy to grip The center console has a compartment in the top which one can store money and other things in  If you lift the top  under is a place for tapes and CDs  or whatever else you like  The cup holders opposite it on the front click in and out  and are sturdy enough  We replaced the regular stereo  and put a CD player there instead  The stereo  though  worked well enough  However  all the buttons are flimsy plastic all the way up the front  not only on the stereo  but the climate control as well  They break easily  and a few no longer glow green  instead showing the white light below The air conditioning is wonderfully cold  never had a problem with it  There s a small LCD above the controls for it  which give you the ability to control the temperature to an exact degree in the car  It will also tell you the temperature outside with the click of a button  And just above that  exactly the same as in my Tempo  is an inverse LCD screen  displaying the time brightly  clearly  and in inverse green and black all the time  Along the driver s door is controls for powered windows  locks  and mirrors  On the ceiling is controls for reading lamps  and more interestingly  a sunroof  which retracts perfectly and adjustably with the button  A screen can be drawn over the sunroof to block the light  additionally  if its bothersome  The windshield wipers come on strong  and do a very good job of keeping everything clear during a storm  though there have been electrical problems with them  See the next section  There s a wiper for the back window as well  which can independently be turned on and off  Quite useful The sound system was mediocre  even if it was  Ford Premium Sound  as was claimed  It was easy to replace and upgrade  and there was even for a spot for a subwoofer under the floor in the back wagon portion of the vehicle  It s the perfect distance for wonderful bass which doesn t overpower  The high beams can be turned on by pulling back the windshield wiper stick  which unfortunately also can be a pest if the wipers go on by accident  The lights themselves turn on and off automatically  depending on the light level  There s a knob to turn them on and off manually as well  if you wish  Furthermore  that same stick controls the blinkers  which are loathe to turn off automatically in a turn unless its very sharp   Problems  Oh boy  We thought when we got this car that everything was basically new and fixed and in working order  When I borrowed it  Utoh  I was used to driving my underpowered Chrysler LeBaron  And thusly  had a very heavy foot  I ripped the engine off its mounts in driving to college  and made it stall several times  It wasn t really my fault  I was told  though  We discovered that the engine needed to be rebuilt  Not really worth it to do so  though Instead  Dad got a whole new engine from a friend  A 1996 Ford Taurus Engine  essentially the same as the old one  straight from a car owned by older people that had been totaled from the back  Only 60K miles  too  So  he put it in  on new mounts  And it ran well after a bit of adjusting However  another problem occurred promptly after  The hose for the power steering broke partially  So  Dad fixed it  It broke again  He fixed it again  It broke again  He fixed it with an expensive kit again  It broke again  He fixed it temporarily  it broke again as expected  but by that time  the super duty kit came  That worked  The engine is unbalanced enough for the hose to shake and break off each time  This is a problem he knew about beforehand  though  Next problem is one that still is present  Another known problem with the Taurus is the windshield wiper electronics are flaky  And that s true with this one  They don t always stop at the bottom when turned off  and often stop all together when running  Very dangerous  One needs to turn them on and off after that  to get them to go again  The car creeks ominously in turns  though its nothing to worry about  I m told  Wind noise is otherwise minimal  though  even at high speeds  Though  thanks to the engine being on those weak mounts  fast acceleration is dangerous to the health of the car  and should be avoided  Those are major problems  and I know it has suffered more in the past than just that  Overall  its miserably unreliable  even if it is a comfy feature filled ride  I m afraid I ll break it each time I drive it b Conclusion  As nice of a car as it is  its problems would prevent us from ever considering it again  It really wasn t worth it overall to fix it so many times  And just barely worth it to fix it each individual time as well  As nice as it looks and handles  the 1992 Taurus Wagon is a time bomb  and we know we ll have to replace it sometime soon  even if we ll miss all its neat little features  
Neg, The first serious driving lesson I ever had was in this car  so I have a certain soft spot for it  My father frighteningly guided me through the suburban roads of Concord  Massachusetts as I learned the nuances of control and timing that comprise the art of driving  I will always love the 1992 Ford Taurus for heralding me to the wonderful  amazing world of driving  But  I must concede that it is a far from perfect piece of machinery My father owns the Taurus GL  mid range model  with the optional 3 8 liter V6 engine  With a reasonable price  this car is the perfect family hauler  or at least it would be if were not for a few problems This car is very spacious  While the seats are not exceptionally comfortable  there is plenty of leg room front and back for just about any potential passenger  Because of this fact  long road trips are not a large hassle with the Taurus  The cargo space is simply massive  larger than most other wagons and some SUVs The handling of the Taurus wagon is not spectacular  The steering feel is somewhat heavy  almost truck like  The brakes are also very heavy  although they work exceptionally well with the optional anti lock system  On turns  the car goes where you want it  but torque steer is VERY heavy and the wheel does not smoothly spin back to its center but instead jerks and stops repeatedly on the way there  Still  the handling is appropriate to this type of car  and compared to other American made station wagons  it is actually pretty good The internal controls of the car are placed very well  The window and lock controls are placed as well and are as easy to operate as those in Japanese cars  The Speedometer and tachometer are very clear  The speedometer does not go very high so the exact speed is very easy to determine from a quick glance  The only control that I do not like is the gear shifter attached to the steering column  Unless you have the exact sequence memorized  which is not too hard  shifting gears is difficult  Despite my preferential gripe  this feature frees more floor space and makes possible seating for a small person between the driver and the front passenger The Wagon looks nice enough  Not terribly sleek  but not heinously ugly like the 1996 and later Taurus models  I personally think that this particular generation  92    95  is the best looking of all Taurus models The Taurus is pretty safe  My father was hit on the side at highway speed and he walked away without a scratch  the only result being a large dent on one door  The frame was not warped at all and the door was all that had to be fixed The 3 8 liter V6 gives only 140 hp  but they are available at a low RPM  3800  and they are accompanied by a whopping 215 pounds foot of torque  These numbers mean that the engine has more than enough muscle to tackle any hill or haul any load just so long as blazing speed or off the line performance are not needed  Actually  the acceleration is pretty good for a larger mid sized wagon  This does come at the expense of gas mileage  In city driving  the mileage is well under 20 miles per gallon Unfortunately  this 3 8 liter V6 power plant is apparently one of the least reliable engines ever made by Ford  Together with Ford s standard average to below average reliability  we have a volatile combination  My father spends quite a bit of money on repairs  most recently and notably  he had to have the transmission rebuilt and he had to have extensive work done on the brakes  These repairs were done at both great expense and great inconvenience The Taurus is a good family hauler with decent power and good space  however the reliability problems make it hard for me to recommend it even though I very much want to  
Neg, In general AVOID this car at all costs  unless you LOVE to crawl under the car every night to fix something  Oh the list could go one forever  visit the  read this before buying a ford taurus  website  My personal problems  transmission replaced twice  motor mounts three times  ignition switch  twice  broken springs on the rear  fuel pump whines  brakes failed three times  power steering hoses blew  wiper motor failed  plastic ends of radiator leaked  and many more that I can not remember at present  Do yourself a favor  spend the extra   on a Camry  Dont get sucked in by lower priceing  You WILL live to regret and wind up spending the same   in the long run  
Neg,  Introduction  Man  I can t believe I m doing this  I m breaking my own rule  I m updating and reposting the article  Why am I doing this  Because my opinion of this truck has completely changed  It has transferred its weight from my love it list  to my hate it list  all in one day This truck is the SuperCab  4 6 Liter  Automatic  4x4  XL with add ons  Flare side pickup b Pros  Not many The airconditioner is cold  Very cold  I love the airconditioner The cupholders are great  Easily holding anything up to huge drinks confidently The radio sounds great and I love the controls  easy to reach from the driver seat The paint is still beautiful  even after 162 000 miles not on the same engine It is very roomy  you could easily seat six in the interior You are sitting very high in the truck  command of the road is there  you feel powerful but you aren t We haven t put any transmissions in it  lack of power from the engine is why  I m guessing The doors are cool when you need to unlock them  pull up on the handle and they are unlocked  The single key is also nice b Neutral  A third door is great  albeit on the passenger side  when it would be really helpful on the drivers side One gas tank is enough right  I expect two in Ford trucks  Especially with this gas mileage b Cons  Bear with me  this is going to take a while The engine that I thought was the original wasn t  original replaced at 80 000 miles  died at 159 000 miles  It was gutless then  I forgave it  assuming that it was tired from 159 000 miles of service  The new engine is worthless  4 6 liters of gas guzzling worthless junk  Zero to sixty was measured not professionally  to be 18 or 19 seconds  Towing has to be less than 4 000 lbs Gas mileage is always nice  this truck doesn t get it  It gets gas footage  It gets 67 584 feet per gallon  Or more commonly referred to as 12 8 mpg  In a tiny V8  This was with AC on not max  on the highway  with overdrive on  This was my low  average is about 15  with a maximum of 17 once  25 mph for two hours because of hazardous road conditions The bench seat in the front is stupid  I hate it  It moves with the driver  so if the driver is short  the passenger better hope  s he is too  The rear seat is no better  very cramped The seat in this truck is ridiculous  Lack of lumbar always leaves me with a back ache  There is no padding which leaves my backside sore  and the headrest pushed your head forward The cruise control freaked out on me  I pushed resume  assuming it would reach 65 mph assigned  it looked down to the surprise of 80 mph and climbing  Sometimes it won t work at all The radio has the curious gremlin of not shutting off sometimes  It will continue to be on  although the button is in Styling has to be the worst  It looks like its trying to be aerodynamic  but at the same time appears as if it is going to fall on its nose This truck will not hold an allignment  After the first one wore off  we replaced ball joints  steering items among other things  It has been alligned three times in the last year and was out of allignment yesterday b Overall  This truck downright sucks  The engine sucks  the gas mileage sucks  the little things drive me crazy I do not recommend this truck  Look elsewhere br br  
Neg, My apologies first off for the rambling course this post is about to take  these are the things I ve encountered in the last 10mos as they occur to me  If you are under  5 8 quot  this truck is way too big for you  I am 5 4 quot  and when I shift gears  my legs rub against the dash  indicating that the truck would likely break my legs in the event of a front end collison  The air bags are nigh on fatal for a person of my size  and the seat has to be so far forward when I drive it  that I look like a hood ornament  If you are independantly wealthy and gas prices don t affect you  Go ahead  This baby s for you  It ll quickly help you lose weight  by first lightening your wallet  spare change jar  and mattress where you store that hidden stash of cash  Kraft dinner for a month after repairs  I researched the cost of a clutch in the event that I needed it   650 cdn for parts alone  I nearly crashed the truck upon reciept of that information I bought the truck because I wanted to have something to haul materials for house renovations  and for a horse trailer in the near future  I learned afterwards that the modifications required to handle a horse trailer greatly exceeded the ins and payment savings of having purchased a 6cyl  The truck has great  quot get up and go quot  but a word of advice  if your performance or milage decrease  don t let them reprogram it  it hasn t run run right since  It s been so expensive to me  both the gas milage and the cost of  quot diagnostics quot  to find out what s wrong with it  that I can t afford to gas it up anymore  nor can I afford to take it in to find out what s wrong with it Following is a copy of the email that I sent to Ford of Canada  To date  this issue has not been resolved  and I am about to trade the truck off on something more economical  and less prone to breakage I m sure there s more  but it s late and I can t remember anything else right now  Storm Why in the world would something as dangerous as the brakeline freezing due to the exhaust pipe being in front of the wheels not be a  quot recall quot  I bought a 97 F 150 about 10 months ago  upon the advice of a friend who had had wonderful things to say about the one that he has  I recently noticed that it was increasingly difficult to get out of my driveway some days  the truck smelled terrible  like something burnt  and my gas mileage was awful  I have been releasing the brake  the light was off  the pedal was up  but the brake apparently was still on  I called the dealership  because I had been told to watch for this problem  and had wanted it fixed  They said that because the truck was no longer on its  quot original warranty quot  that the repair would not be done by Ford  and that to have it done is about  700   This seems a little steep doesn t it  Especially since  a catback system for my other vehicle was only  200 installed  and that was tuned exhaust  And also that they thought that I should bring the truck in so that they can make sure that there s no damage to the wheels or brakes  So now  because of a design flaw on Ford s part  I have endangered my brakes and wheels as well  Why should I potentially be liable for a repair like this  This seems a little bit ridiculous to me  and frankly  with the way that this truck has  nickeled and dimed  me for the last 10 months  power steering pump  oil pan gasket  MAF sensor  computer reprogrammed 2x  a check engine light when I  silly me  decided to wash the engine  back firing  17mi ga combined driving  block heater cord  this was the last straw    I don t even have the money to do this sort of work anymore  It has steadily whittled my bank balance to practically nothing   I have had it in for warranty work 4 times in the space of the first 6months I had it paid a deductible 2 times  as some of the work relied on parts and I was asked to bring it back a second time  was charged for things that WERE on warranty  when I called Ford Customer Care  I was told that it was an issue between myself and the dealership  and that Ford would not intervene  That sounds a lot like the dealerships have been given autonomy  that s quite frightening  and there are numerous things that are not covered by the  quot don t worry  it s all covered on warranty quot  warranty  so sayeth the salesman that I purchased the truck from  as well as the Sales manager  Service manager and several other people of the dealership  coverage that I purchased  I had purchased this truck so that I could park a car that I  thought  was costing me a great deal of money  I had thought that I would have a vehicle that I would have to do only routine maintenance on  and that would be reliable  and not a source of financial drain  Soon I will have a clutch to do  possibly brakes  they say that my exhaust is shot  I think it s safe to say that I couldn t have done all this damage in the amount of time that I ve had the vehicle  I have had to do rear brakes once in my other vehicle  and a clutch once  as I learned to drive a manual on this vehicle  and had a leaky rear main seal  This is in the space of nearly 8 years  And exhaust doesn t corrode that fast  I don t care how many kms you put on it  Based on the last 10 months  I might have to park the truck  and I AM puttng my poor little 83 Firebird back on the road  It gets 22mi gal even though it s shooting gas out of the top of the carborator  If the brakes can freeze on  what stops them from freezing when they are not on  I m told there s a great deal of hydraulic pressure that stops this from being an issue  but the system is only as good as it s weakest part  and when using the  brute force  method to break them free  I would think that something somewhere has got to give  Not to mention what it will likely do to the tires  such as icing them up  This would cause poor braking conditions  wouldn t it  I would rather not find this out by hitting another vehicle or worse yet  a person  I understand that there were safety concerns that were the reason that Ford was making the modifications  do these safety concerns go away once the truck is not on warranty  I should think not  I would think that this would be a recall situation  and not just a bulletin  This situation concerns me a great deal  and if I do not find satisfactory resolution for it  I may have to lodge a complaint with Consumer Reports br br  
Neg, We took our 1997 Ford super cab truck in to be serviced as soon as we received the fuel line recall notice  The servicing Ford dealer inspected the fuel line and stated that the fuel line had passed inspection and did not need replacing  Evidently it is Ford s policy not to replace a defective part unless it is malfunctioning  We drove down to Florida about two months later and noticed poor gas mileage  When the truck was parked  we also noticed a strong gas odor  Upon examining the street under the truck  we saw gas dripping from our truck  We immediately called for an appointment to arrange for the problem to be repaired  which turned out to be the recalled fuel line unbeknown to us  The repair was made  but we were not informed that the problem was due to the safety recall  We were advised to take the problem to Ford directly  We wrote Ford and subsequently received a phone call from their customer relations center advising us that the part repaired WAS the safety recalled fuel line and to get in touch with the original dealer who made the inspection  That dealership is going to reimburse us for repairs  but we have other expenses we incurred due to the safety recall not being repaired when first inspected  We will have to go to Ford directly  again  for these additional expenses  The bottom line is that Ford should be more proactive in repairing all safety recalls whether or not they are malfunctioning at the time  As it stands now  it is our understanding from two dealerships that Ford repairs only malfunctioning parts in safety recalls  We might have been exposed to a fire or something worse had we not noticed the problem ourselves  This seems to be an ongoing problem with Ford Motor Company and we feel they need an attitude adjustment if they are going to stay in business  
Neg, I bought a new 97 F150  and I had it only 4 months and traded it in It was a v8  and it had no power what so ever We live on a mountain  and I would have to shift into 3rd gear to climb it  while little 4cy s were flying up it  I was embarrassed Sorry  but when I put that much money into something  I want it to perform for me  and this truck didn t I think this truck is best suited for flat areas  it did do well at highway speeds  but like I said   no power pulling a hill To be honest I like a truck that is a little more flashy looking  and this didn t make me say  quot wow quot this was the only vehicle that we have owned that I could say I hated it I know some people are reading this and saying they love their truck and I am glad you like yours  I didn t like mine br br  
Neg, I own a 97 F150 supercab V6 with automatic transmission  I now wish I had my old 5 speed Nissan back  If you go to the NTSB website you will see that Ford has more recalls than any other car maker  First  some credit  The truck looks and rides nicely  But that s where it stops  With the kind of money you put into a car these days  you expect value  I bought the truck for more roominess and a bigger payload  I bought it used in  99 with 33K on it  Since then  I have been mailed 3 recalls  one for fuel line leaks  one for a timing cover gasket leak  and one for a steering shaft possible breakage and accident  The truck developed a rattling noise that sounded like a loose exhaust part  it turned out to be both catalytic coverters  This cost me  550 to replace  During that time the check engine light had come on  Why  Because the head gasket on the right side had blown  97K miles  Had to replace that  and all 4   oxygen sensors  The catalytics failed because they were filled with coolant from the blown head gasket  Total   1200  Next  the alternator went out  100K miles  Then the oil pump went bad  nearlt ruined motor  Then the a c clutch bearings gave out and made the most horrible noise while driving  Replaced that  When this truck gives up  and it s close now at 150K because I think my head gasket is going again and catalytics are rattling again  I will strip what parts are still good and sell them off  then get a Nissan or Toyota  They may not be as pretty or have all the bells and whistles  but you can take one 200K or more and never have to replace anything major with proper care  
Neg, I own a 1996  5 speed  v4   gl version of this car  Happens to be green  the most popular color  I think  so be sure you know where you parked Mine does not have all the bells and whistles  I was looking for a reasonable priced family car  and that s what I got  Safety features  It has a full body crash frame  a nice safety feature I hope to never use  I did not get the abs brakes  I don t happen to like abs  It comes with dual front airbags  the passenger side cannot be turned off  which I wish it could  It has some feature that will drop the engine out in a major crash  also not tested Exterior  Green  aluminum wheel covers  molded bumpers  nothing special Interior  Light gray  green illumination lights  Okay  why do they make automatics with a tach as standard equipment but it s optional equipment for a stick  This has always bugged me  Controls are laid out fairly well  They didn t load up a lot of features on the stalks  which is nice  One side is the wiper controls and the other is the lights  Cruise controls are on the steering wheel at thumb height  Can t stand the rest position for hands at 4 and 8 o clock  the new recommended  safe  position  Horn is still in the center of the steering wheel  but you gotta push hard  Air heat controls nicely laid out  well lit  air is good  heat takes a bit of time  I replaced the factory stereo but the speakers are ok unless you re an audiophile  all four in the doors  It has a cubbyhole under the stereo for expansion or storage  4 cd s fit ok  Hard to get into in 3rd or 5th  Next to the emergency brake is a retractable cup holder  Only holds medium size to go drinks or 12 oz cans  sometimes tips  Two map lights plus a 3rd light with door open delay timer in the center front  Large glovebox  shallow door pockets for both front doors  Adjustable height restraints are nice  Rear has two shoulder restraints and one middle lap belt Features  Power windows  Work well  rear go only to child height  child lockout  Power mirrors good  Remote entry  About worthless  you have to practically stand at the door to get them to work  even with brand new battery Problems   this will take some time  get a drink  Okay  first the latch that releases the fuel door has never worked  I often have to go out of the car to pry it open  can t wait until the day I can t refuel  The knob that adjusts the tilt of the front seat is hard to reach  hard to turn  The direction controls for airflow break really easily  flimsy brittle small pieces of plastic  The back seat is shallow and uncomfortable for anyone over 5  tall  The middle back seat restraint is NOT SUITABLE for a carseat  trust me on this  The dead man foot rest is awful  This year model did not come with the split rear seats  a MUST for all cars of this type and a HUGE oversight on the part of Ford  A rear seats that fold down  even the whole seat  is necessary  and this one could have sure used it  The engine temperature gauge constantly shows the engine as almost in the red  Dealership told me this was  quot normal quot  and they showed me a Ford white paper about it  The engine is LOUD  and if you don t have the radio on you ll go nuts  This is by far the most annoying thing about the car Assets  The front seats are comfy for the short in stature  Ford finally fixed the sticky reverse gear box problem  some will know and understand what I mean  No more forcing the car into reverse or repeatedly pressing the clutch until it goes  In fact  gear box is nice  as is clutch on this car  For a four cylinder  engine performs nicely  Don t expect to race anyone  but you can get it up to 90 without the car shaking to death  don t try this with a 91 escort  Gas mileage is good  Engine is laid out and marked well enough to know what s where  Trunk space is large  but beware the hinges which can crush tall items placed under it Overall  Would be a nice  cheap secondhand car  but leaves much to be desired at new  full price  Has had 2 recalls so far br br  
Neg, My wife and I recently acquired a used 1996 Ford Contour  We were looking for something else but the car dealer convinced us this was  quot the car for us quot  This car has given us nothing but trouble  It has been recalled twice  The speakers are the current problem  The right speakers will periodically stop working  In addition to that the bass has never been really good but I do like to have a system that can at least vibrate the car a little  The bass levels at their highest setting will give most rap songs a little beat but not a boost or a bang  We have also had problems with the air conditioner and the brakes within less than a year from when we bought it  It also does not get good gas mileage  We have to refill at least once a week  We are looking for a way to affordably get rid of it  In all fairness  I may be a little bias because I use to own an 86 Ford Escort and it gave me a large amount of problems and cost me too much money  After the Escort I have developed a negative opinion towards and Ford compact car but this Contour is proving my opinion right  I was hoping that I was wrong about how bad Ford cars are but the Ford Contour that we bought has proven me more right than ever before  Positive comments  Well it does have excellent pick up or  quot get up and go quot  That may attribute to the bad gas mileage  This car is great for those guys who like to race little old ladies at the red light  It will most definitely beat most small cars  buses  and semi trucks  My opinion of this car and most Ford cars is that they are prone to failure  Don t sneeze near it or kick the tires or else it could fall apart  Maybe Ford s just don t like me     
Neg, Myself  being a young guy  went to a Car Dealer  Car Happy  and wanted a car  looked around  was limited to an Automatic Transmission  Looking Around  I was surprised to have seen a big white Ford Contour for such a cheap price  I test drove it  big  lots of buttons  Great  huh They Conned me in to buying it  so I bought it  thank God I got the Extended Warantee  The Car was in the shop many times  One day in the morning  I was getting gas  I learned the gas was on the opposite side of the car  ok  I ll reverse it  pull to the other side  IF I COULD ONLY SHIFT IT OUT OF PARK  The Gear shifter was broken  had to tear it off  allright  I got out of there  Later that day  strange  Windows going up slowly  Starter sounded like it wasn t ever gonna start again  was driving  all of a sudden  wouldnt go over 30  and it decided to stall  Got it fixed  fine  besides the foggyness of the front lights which ruined any attractive qualities the car may have had  the Problems with Turning  axle  the belts to be replaced  the parking light coming on while I was driving  it was a good car  Looked better at night  great power if you turn the Air Conditioner off  and there is noone but you in the car  cant get that with a Honda  Good first car if you have a warantee and a loner car  The only problem I can t get fixed that I hate would have to be whipping around corners  It feels like the Wheels will fall off when you go 15 around a corner  the tires screeching no matter what the air pressure  It is NOT a Honda  don t confuse it as one  it is Big  Bulky  and sorta slow  Don t try to break a speed record     
Neg, This vehicle was a first time lease for my husband and I  It was the only car we qualified for so our choices were limited  We really enjoyed owning a new car  It ran great and we were very pleased with the outside body and all the functions of the motor We found the interior very disappointing  From the first week we had the car there were problems with the interior  The carpet pulled away from the frame and it took 18 months for them to get the parts to fix it  We also had problems with the plastic molding that enclosed the seat belts This molding broke 4 times in 2 years and has to be replaced each time which put the car in the shop for at least one day  At about 20 months the driver side window crank broke off and the dealer said it was not under warranty  Then a week later the passenger side broke also  Neither of the cranks had much use at any time  This car drives smoothly  but if you are looking for good wear and tear this car is not the one  I can not see children doing well in this car br br  
Neg, When you think of Mustangs  the first thing that comes to mind is a muscle car Mustangs have long been classified with such cars as camaros  firebirds  chevlles  and others  But the question for this model is that with the new sporty look of the exterior  which looks gay to me    does the engine and the rest of the car hold up to my expectations  As a young car enthusiast  I went to a local Ford dealership and saw a nice GT Mustang with a V8 in it Very nice   When I say that the Monte Carlo is better here s why  I drive a 1995 Monte Carlo with a 5 year warranty on everything and I got the car for only 8 000 dollars  more than half what I would have to pay for a new Mustang My car is better looking  more powerful since I added a Venom Computer Module which totaled my horsepower to nearly 300hp  and my car will last just as long with its warranty REMEMBER  THIS IS EPINIONS  MEANING IT S MY OPINION i b Exterior b The new model designs I don t particularily like I am more into a bigger car   or if it s smaller and sportier like the new Mustangs  I would like them with a lower center of gravity and with a big sporty spoiler on the back I would ve liked it if they would ve come out with more of a japanese car like version of the mustang if they wanted to create a more sporty version of the car  Yet  with this edition of the Mustang  the car is small  not good for a four seater  and looks awful to me It doesn t really have a racer type look that Ford tried to do with the vehicle   Interior b  The changes compared to an older 1994 model of the Mustang sport very few changes which make me disgust this car There are cheap plastic dash boards for one thing They look very potentially destructive in the way that even a little whap would break it The manual shift control is a pain in the butt Not only is the car a manual  something I hate but have to live with  but the shifter blocks the controls to the CD deck  The climate control was bland  like in any Ford I would recommend Chevy s as being best for a nicely weathered interior Getting into the back seat is much more difficult than I expected Rather pain in the butt task to perform The car is kinda low   and elderly  or just plain old  people will have trouble getting into the small back of the car It is more suited for 16 30 year olds  The unspacious trunk of the car is another bad part of the model If you want a big truck with a sporty look  I d recommend getting a Chevy Monte Carlo   Engine b  The new V6 engine is pretty nice with a 3 8L with 190hp which is nice  but not as good as my much cheaper Monte Carlo which has 215hp But  if you were to invest a little bit more money you could buy a V8 Mustang with 260hp and 220 pounds of torque If you ever put the pedal to the metal in a V8 model  you would feel that power immediately This thing will whip you back like a rag doll  If your thinking about getting a Mustang for the power  don t  A camaro will give you around a 5 2L with a lot more horsepower for only a couple thousand more dollars   Driven b  The drive is nice When you race it against another car  or just press the acceleration all the way  the car makes a nice rumble which will make you squeal like a school girl with excitement The handling of the car was decent It was a lot better than my Monte being a much heavier vehicle  the Monte is Taking turns and corners   the Mustang handles nicely I would have to say   Price b  The car is not a good deal at all  I would recommend buying an older Mustang if you were interested The only good thing about buying a car like this is that they are very easy to upgrade and modify thanks to numerous magazines devoted to it  where s my Monte Carlo magazine   Versions b  The Mustang comes in either basic V6 form  a V8 GT engine  or a Cobra style one which I am not sure how it handles But  my friend told me that a Mustang Cobra is a lot more powerful and a lot more expensive as well   Bottom Line b If you have 20 000 to blow on a car  I would not recommend spending it on a Mustang Buying a nice Firebird with a V8 and a lot more horsepower and torque with a better interior and exterior look is a much better investment  
Neg, This is my third time owning a Mustang  I purchased 2000 GT Convertible August 1999  my dream car  this is my third and the other 2 had transmission and BIG engine problems  But I just knew this Mustang was going to be different  Laserred  camel color top and leather seats  CD player  Mach sound system and all the bells and whistles  The gas wasn t bad but the pick up wasn t as fast as I had driven in Camero s and Firebirds  When I had the top up  because of rain and most of the time I drove with the top down in the rain  as long as you drive you won t get wet  I could hear a humming noise in the rear of the car  Every week it got louder  It just didn t squeal when I wanted it to  The car was sluggish  I had just turned in my 1998 Mustang Convertible 6 cylinder because there were transmission problems with it and I heard the 8 cylinder didn t have the same problems  WRONG It ended up that some bearings or something in the rear end were no good to begin with  When we got the car back it seemed faster but over a few weeks time it began making noise again  We don t drive it fast all the time and we didn t do anything out of the ordinary to make this happen  This car was having problems from the moment we purchased it NEW  The leather seats were nice but they are low to the ground and your legs are extended so it is not as comfortable as a car but it s better than other sports cars I ve ridden in  The sound system is to die for  We live in south Florida and it s HOT there and we put the top up and the sun beats on the canvas and the a c doesn t compensate for the heat  The canvas lets the heat in the car  We sweat like a hore in church  that s how hot it gets in the summer riding in the Mustang with the top up 28 000 you would think they could build a car that would last  It isn t worth the money  For the third time I m disappointed  Read my review on the 1998 Laserred Mustang Convertible and the 1995 White Mustang Convertible I purchased a Ford Ranger in 1994 and was happy with it  Not a problem  Ford knows how to do trucks  but cars  that s a different story Needless to say we traded the Mustang in on a 2001 Explorer Sports Trac We love it  We are cured of Mustang fever We miss the Mustang a lot  the dealer gave us  22 000 trade in after only 1 year and they are now selling it for  25 500  They will make a nice profit on it  We felt that if we kept the vehicle that we would have continuous problems with the rear end and transmission br br  
Neg, The new mustangs dont really impress me that much  One of my best friends have one and i find it a pain in the butt to take people around in it  Dont get me wrong  the car looks allright bt inside unless you are in the fron seat you are going to be very unconfortable  The sound system in it sounds nice even without the subs he added  Hes got a 6 cylinder and it feals like its got alot of power but only 190 HP my truck can out run that but of coarse i have a standard  Having a CD player and a Tape was a good thing  It takes corners well and its ok on gas The mustangs have gone way down in price  i think that is why they are becoming a little more bland  When i was looking for a car i test drove a 98 GT and i was impressed wth everything except the size of the back seat  I will write a epinion on it too look for it The mustang carries a great name but they are turning int a 2 seater that really doesnt have the power that it used to  ever since they stopped makin the 5 0 engines in 94 Overall you get a car wth a small backseat  ok gas mileage  looks kinda nice  a name that every1 knows  sounds ok  It is great for my friend he is single and usually carries one friend  But only one friend  I would say get something with a little bigger back seat br br  
Neg, I have never owned either a Chevrolet Camaro or a Ford Mustang  My opinion is based purely on my sporadic drives   Mustang My first impression of the Mustang is that I see it on the street WAY to frequently  Everybody and their brothers  aunts  grandmas  cousins  and co workers has on  Who would want to buy a car that everyone else has  Not me  How am I supposed to show off in a car that everyone else has  The second thing  that really drives me crazy  about this car is the way it receives so much kudos for being more comfortable  Sports cars should not be judged on comfort  If you want comfort  buy a Buick  Sports cars should tear up the race track and leave two black lines down the middle of the streets  The constant praising of the comfort on this car being better is really quite moronic  Sure comfort helps  but sports cars should be judged on the length of the black strips left behind  o  The Mustang is a nice looking car  I do have to say that it looks slightly better than the Camaro  It s a bit boxy but it still wins this battle  The stereo on this Mustang just really sucks  There is no other way of saying it  This stereo is a senior citizen s stereo in the way that it has little bass and needs to be cranked near full blast before it can satisfy a music lover  I guess they re pairing it with the  quot comfortable interior quot  to please their family car buyers  They definitely aren t pleasing the sports car enthusiast who wants to go tearing up the hiways with the tunes bumpin  On to the driving  I found that this car drove quite nice  It s pretty fast  can turn well and do all of the stuff that a real sports car can do  I didn t go test either cars sporty ability since the cars weren t mine to mess with  But from what driving I did do  it seems to handle nice and provide a pretty good ride  Uhh I think the only other thing I  being someone who doesn t own one  can say about it is that the interior components look old  They are the same dials and stereo systems that used to be in the old F 150 s back before they changed to their space ship design  The components all seem functional  they just don t look flashy at all  The Camaro s aren t a whole lot better  but they still are better   Camaro  I will talk about the same things in the same order with maybe one or two additions  This car is not near as common as the Mustang  I might see one or two a day  and when I do  it s a treat  Put on some shiny rims and flowmasters in this baby and your bound to get some attention  There s not as much competition to compete with  This car is less comfortable than the Mustang  but who cares  The front seats are fine by my standards for two people to go wherever they want to go  The back seats aren t too roomy at all  but sports cars don t need back seats  These seats were probably just designed to give grocery bags added comfort  o  But really  comfort is not a huge factor in buying a sports car  Your in the wrong class of cars if that s what your looking for  Even though the  Stang gets the kudos for looks  I still think the Camaro is a nice looking car  It does need an update  but it is still a really nice looking car  The SS version is extremely attractive  The Camaro majorly wins the stereo battle between the two cars  This stereo is comparable to the stereo I had specially installed in my Yukon  It is really an awesome stereo with a ton of bass and enough volume to lift you out of your chair  A definite pro in my book  Driving both of these cars was a different experience for me because I was used to a big Yukon but the  Stang s driving position was a little higher which made it easier to get used to at first but the Camaro s was just as good once you got used to it  When you drive a car that isn t yours  the driving position is always a little wierd  The Camaro is one fast car  I had the chance to open the throttle to this bad boy and boy did it move  Amazing  Braking was good on both  The Camaro s handling was a little better  I think  Just my opinion though  Everybody s different  I loved listening to the exhaust sound in this car  In the Mustang you just hear the buzz of the engine while in the Camaro you hear the roar of the exhaust  Definitely awesome  The components in this car are functional and are more modern than the Mustangs  These components are logically placed and easy to use  Gotta love that stereo  If I was to buy one I would probably buy a Camaro because they look so awesome when they are fixed up whereas the Mustang s start looking a little unearthly  as nearly all of Ford s vehicles do  With Camaro s you can get more for you money  so I ve read in Motor Trend and just about every other auto magazine out there  Once again  that stereo might make the decision for me though  It would save me a few thousand of having to upgrade the Mustang s  Oh  and an addition on the Camaro  you gotta love those T Tops  What a compromise between a convertible and a coupe  They are really cool     
Neg, I recently went on a trip to Kentucky and I had to rent a car  I wanted a mid sized sedan but the rental office didn t have any  so they decided to  quot upgrade quot  me to this little car  I won t call it a sports car because it lacked the performance I would like in a sports car  and it was nothing compared to my Monte Carlo SS  even when it was all stock  I guess you can t compare apples to oranges though  the Mustang did only have a V6  which had less power than my Blazer s V6  First I will start off with what I liked about the Mustang  I did like the way the exterior looked  It was quite stylish  with its angled curves  and fake ram air ducts  I also liked the sterio  it looked better than the ones in my Chevy s  but did not put out the sound like them  It came with a fairly decent package  It had air  cruise  power windows and locks  a tape player  and a CD player  I also liked the cruise control on the steering wheel  it was much easier to get to than on my Chevys which have it on the turn signal switch  That is about all I liked What I didn t like  which proves my theory that Fords are made very cheaply  is the abundance of plastic parts in the interior  The doors were about 99  plastic  which made it very uncomfortable to rest my arm on it  It was cold in the mornings  and when it got hot during the day my arm would stick to it  The dash was also all plastic  and did not look good at all  Every part of the car that I touched felt like it was going to break if I put any pressure on it  Next is the lack of power  Now I know it was only a V6  so I don t want a million comments telling me how I should drive a 5 0  or a Cobra and see if my opinion changes  I have driven a Camero with a V6  and I am not being at all one sided toward Chevy here  it did have much more power  I tried to spin up the tires a little on the Mustang  and the only way I could was by doing a brake torque  The Mustang was not a bad car to drive  but it just wasn t a sports car  The ride was very bumpy  and when cornering  it felt like you are going to lose control  It had the sports car look  but not the sports car feel  I think I ll stick to my Chevy muscle cars and trucks for now  my  85 Monte SS is 10 times the car the Mustang is  Thank you Ford once again  the Mustang turned me completely off of buying a sports car br br  
Neg, My father recently fulfilled his dream of owning a sports vehicle  He went out and purchased a brand spanking new blue convertable Mustang  I guess when you reach the age of 71 you can do whatever you please  When pop s showed up at my house with his new  quot toy quot  my first impression of the car was  quot Wow quot  It sure was a beauty  And he didn t have to twist my arm to take a test drive  Getting into the vehicle was quite an obstacle  I think this car is made for people under 5 feet tall  And it felt odd sitting so close to the road  I m used to driving my Chevy full sized pickup  so this was a very unusual feeling for me  Almost like sitting in a little go cart  Lowering the top was pretty easy  once I figured out that I had to have the car in  quot park quot  and the  quot emergency brake quot  set  Then  with a simple push of a button  the roof smoothly went down  Away we went  Not as powerful as I expected a sports car to be  but a very smooth and comfortable ride  You ve got to really pay attention to the speedometer because it s easy not to realize just how fast you re driving this baby  In fact  my stepmother got a speeding ticket within 2 weeks of owning this car  There weren t too many features in this particular Mustang  It did include a pretty decent stereo system with AM FM radio  cassette player  and CD player  There were built in cup holders  and a covered compartment for storing things  The A C works great  Automatic seat adjustments  mirror adjustments  windows  and locks  Sure  it was thrilling driving this toy around  I particularly enjoyed the looks on my neighbor s faces as I passed them by  But is this car worth the price just to impress people  I think not  As a family man  this vehicle would not make a good choice  There is very little room for passengers in the back seat  and they must have very short legs to even have some remote comfort  Feeling pretty cramped  I just can t imagine making a long trip in this car  If you re single  have the money  the insurance is outrageous  and enjoy expensive showy cars  this one is for you  Personally  once the novelty had worn off  I was glad I own a truck br br  
Neg, I test drove this vehicle and I have to say that it was really nice  decked out  and it gave a smooth ride  But  it was very tight for space on the inside  If you usually travel in your car with more than one person other than yourself  I would not recommend this car  Although  If you want something sporty and nice  I would definitely get this car   although everyone else already has one  I would recommend the 2000 Mercury Cougar for everyone  Be sure to check my review on the new 2000 model Mercury Cougar V 6 Sport Coupe  The car is magnificent br br  
Neg, Considering a new 2000 Ford Mustang GT  Think twice  In fact  don t think about it at all  I m on my fourth late model Mustang and definitely my last  The quality of the vehicles has gone down hill over the past two years and Fords service and support structure is even worse The car has been in the shop constantly since I purchased the car new late last year  It still has unresolved problems that both the dealers and Ford are unable to diagnose and fix  I ve communicated with several other 2000 Mustang GT owners with similar problems ruling out the possibility that my Mustang is anomaly The car has excellent power for the price paid  is fun to drive and looks good with the top down  Handling is good once the stock tires are replaced with a set of real performance tires  However  the rigidity of the car is marginal  Several rattles and squeaks are present and one might think the car was going to  quot fall apart quot  over rough roads The key statement here is  quot for the price paid quot  If you can t afford a real performance car and are willing to put up with marginal quality and poor service  then this is the right car  Just be sure to sell it before the warranty expires br br  
Neg, What is wrong with this car  you ask EVERYTHING The 2000 Mustang GT is a total lame excuse for a sportscar  I purchased a 2000 red Mustang GT in November of 1999  I was the first in my town to have one of the new bodystyles  The car was loaded  with sunroof  leather  CD with the premium speakers  all power you name it this car had it I was happy with my decision to buy a Mustang until the car wouldn t start one morning  My little red  Stang was only 4 months old and had less than 6K miles on her  I phoned the Ford dealership and explained my problem  They didn t even seem surprised and they weren t apologetic or understanding  After waiting THREE hours  and missing a day of work  the wrecker showed up and took my pretty red Mustang to the Ford dealership   Wait  I thought   I don t have transportation now I phoned Ford and asked for a rental or loaner car  Their reply   I can give you the number to Hertz Car Rental Great  I thought  and Ford is going to pick up the bill  right  WRONG  Ford told me I was on my own Come to find out  the alternator had gone bad  Ford replaced the alternator and I picked up my car the following morning  No big deal  right That very day the driver s side window wouldn t come back up after I put it down  The motor had gone out Back to the Ford dealership with no rental car  It took them two whole days to replace the motor I was furious I went to the Nissan dealership and test drove a Maxima  That was not what I was looking for  A friend told me to drive a Camaro Z28  I did just that The power  ride and handling was phenomenal  I had to have it  After picking up my POS Mustang GT  I took it straight to the Chevy dealership  before anything else could break on it  and traded it in for a 2000 Chevrolet CamaroZ28  I will be writing my review of my new Z in the near future If you re considering purchasing a Ford  atleast drive a Chevy first  I thank my friend everyday for referring me there  Don t make the same mistake I did  I try to let everyone know about my mishap with the Rustang and in doing so  I came across the following website www fordtruckssuck com Seems I m not the only one who s had NUMEROUS problems with Ford  
Neg, A few years ago  in 1995  I bought a new Ford Mustang  I wanted to buy an American car  I didn t even think of getting anything else  I was trading in my Ford F 150  I wanted better gas milage  something cute  The first morning after I bring home my little silver bullet  it won t start  Ford has to come over and give me a new battery  I told them to come pick it up and take it back  I expect for the car to be able to start after having it for like 12 hours  No can do  It s now my car  I think I saw the paint turn slightly yellow  Naw  must have been my imagination  It couldn t be turning into a lemon  Ford built cars Ford Tough  So  I went to work in it  It was fine  For about a month Then the squeaking started  The dash squeaked the whole time the car was on  The really annoying high pitched squeaking  Then the cassette player broke  Ford said it was my tape  Ok  Then it ate 3 more tapes  I want a new radio  Ok bring it in  and I m just out for the cost of the tapes  I pick up my car  and guess what  Same radio  I had got some hair spray on the clock and I could see that the same pots were still there  Oh yeah  well  they knew that the radio wasn t replaced  they just didn t have one in  But the fixed the squeak  Cool  So I had to make another appointment to come in and have it put in  The dash didn t squeak for almost 2 full blocks  After that the back seatbelt broke  Then the front one  They wouldn t stay buckled  Then the engine started having problems  Then everything inside the car started breaking  Everything made out of plastic  that had to move  open or shut broke  It s a 1995 and has been in the shop 31 times     
Neg, Why oh why do people continually by the Ford Mustang  The answer is because they are cheap and some people think that they look cool  The Mustang is a car that formerly had a proud heritage and used to stand toe to toe with the Chevrolet Camaro and the Pontiac Firebird  Now  decades later  the only car the base level V 6 powered Mustang can beat is the Honda Accord  The fact that Ford  quot upped quot  the power output in the current generation Mustang V 8s just goes to show that Mustang owners everywhere were getting trounced at red lights by the GM faithful in their Camaros and Firebirds  Is this not humiliating to a Mustang owner  Can the Mustang loyalists hold their heads up proudly knowing that there are a plethora of more superior vehicles out there  The answer      yes they can  In the past the Mustang was am amazing car and it single handedly defined the  quot muscle car quot  genre  but the same cannot be said for the Mustang of today  If I wanted a mid sized car that was reasonably quick and rather sporty looking  I would opt for an Accord coupe  Then at least I would know that my car would outlive me br br  
Neg, The Ford Mustang Convertible is fast  good looking  and fun to drive  Corvettes and BMWs are great sports cars too  What if they were the same price  The decision is easy  The Ford Mustang is a clear example of a car that is just too expensive  A Mustang Convertible starts out at  21 000  Of course the real sports enthusiast get leather and all the options  If you can t afford the options  then don t buy the car in the first place  The options are an integral part to the Mustang  ABS  Leather  Spoiler  Power Seats  dual  and the Smokers Package  aka the Cell Phone Package  Doesn t everyone who drives a sports car have a cell phone  They should  Anyway  my point is this  A Mustang starts at 21K  but add tax  warranty  all the options  delivery  and the price gets to  27 500  And this is the price for an LX version  not the GT or Cobra  So I would rather take this money and buy a real sports car that is worth the money  I think the Mustang Convertible should be worth  20 000 for everything  That is reasonable  I find the current cost not reasonable because there are many more prestigious faster cars out there  Why not buy a used Corvette  It will keep its value longer  A Mustang loses 50  of its value after only two years  Or why not buy a brand new BMW  the entry level 300 series for  23 000 base  This will keep its value more and a BMW base model with no options is a lot more luxurious and more prestigious than a Mustang Convertible loaded  whether or not it is a Cobra or GT  It is your choice  But if you want to be noticed  have some prestige  and spend your money smart  Then buy a Corvette used or a new BMW  A Mustang is great  but it is just too expensive br br  
Neg, This car has plently of power and handles well  Also it is a pretty goos head turner in performance red Unfortunately  mine has been plagued with problems  Furthermore  Ford  especially my dealership  has been very unreceptive and downright mean  I have bought Fords my entire life  expect for a little Toyota pickup once   and this will be my last  It is unfortunate that this car was not tweaked a little more because3 it would be awesome  When I first bought it it wasn t even safe  The car would accelerate to wide open throttle from a stop  It was out of control  The only way I could stop it was to turn the key off  After 16k though  Ford has been unable to trace other problems  For instance the car dies a couple times a week at least  during deceleration  It is embarassing and it is dangerous when it happens on a curve  They did fix the horn on the second try though  Good car if you like to have a black box in your car and press a little button when you fear for your life  
Neg, I know I wrote an similar review on the Lincoln Navigator  but these SUVs are identical and the same information applies To bring up a few important points about large SUVs to consider before purchasing  As you know  large SUVs have been stirring up a lot of controversy lately that buyers should know about  I recently purchased a new car  but considered an SUV first and did a lot of research into them and promptly changed my mind  First of all  there are lots off hidden costs on large SUVs  like the Expedition  Of course  unless you have  35 000  to spend on one  you are going to have a high car payment  Which is obvious  most consumers expect this  But did you budget the high fuel cost as well  A Ford Expedition weights between 5 424 to 5 774 pounds  Because of this  it has a V8 engine  Which means it gets 12 5 miles per gallon or less average  Meaning that a Expedition driver is paying on average 3 to 4 times more for gas that a car driver  This will add somewhere between  100 to  250 a month to your car payment  Okay  gas is cheap now but for how long  When it goes back up  typically the resale value on the Expedition and other large SUVs goes down considerably  no one wants something that is going to use that much gas when the cost is unsteady  That s a lot of money to lose  Then there s insurance  Because the Expedition is big and heavy  if the driver gets into an accident  it will cause a lot of property damage and injuries that your insurance company will have to pay for  On top of that  there is a big risk that the drivers or drivers family of the smaller cars will sue you  Which means you and or your insurance company could be out a lot of money  They plan for this by charging a lot higher premium on SUVs than normal size cars  This can vary with no fault states  You should get a quote from your insurance company first  Now  on average  the Expedition puts out over 3 times the carbon dioxide of a normal sized car  This really angers people who care about the environment and causes them to do things to protest against this  One of the popular things is  SUV tagging  Where they ll put bumper stickers on your SUV say things like your changing the climate and you don t care about the air  Please check out the sites I have listed below for more information on this  http abcnews go com sections us DailyNews madtaggers001225 html http www baaction org SUVticket index html http www idontcareaboutair com bumpers index shtml http www charm net marc chronicle suv may01 html http poseur 4x4 org topten html This is a new trend and who knows where it will go  But do you want to constantly worry about your expensive Expedition being vandalized and then pay for the repairs  That s just more costs to worry about  Like keeping your vehicle in your garage  Not the Expedition and most large SUVs  they won t fit unless you have a custom oversized garage another expense  But  if you leave is outside  it s always dirty and that s a lot of SUV to wash or have washed  One more popular misconception about large SUVs is that they are safer for families  For the most part  they are not  Especially the Expedition  it s based of the Ford F 150 chassis which has terrible ratings because it is still a truck body with out properly designed crumple zones or a firewall keeping the engine out of your lap  Please check http www iihs org first  The new VW Beetle gets better crash test ratings that most Ford Lincoln SUVs and trucks  Do your research first on any SUV  I recommend outlining why you need an SUV  maybe a minivan would be better because you can save  10 000 to  15 000  have a safer  more versatile vehicle and get better gas mileage  Take the money you saved and use it for kids college or early retirement  Or maybe a vehicle that large is not needed at all  
Neg, I love my boyfriend dearly but his car is another story  His 1992 Mustang LX is a car I d love to shoot over and over again  I have had just as much experience driving this car as I have had riding it in  Driving it didn t use to be so bad until the car s mileage went up and of course  so did the repair bills  The car was bought with about 70 000 miles and it is now up to about 125 000 miles but at least it s still running barely Now I can understand that once a car gets older that repairs are going to be needed but it s getting to the point it is worse than mine and I didn t think that was possible The engine in his car is a 4 cylinder with  from the specs I saw researching on the web  is 90 HP  I almost laughed when I found this out  At least it beats a Chevy Metro  Surprisingly though  I was in disbelief on how little it had  if I m wrong guys correct me  because for a four cylinder it was pretty quick off a dead stop  From what I understand also is that this car is pretty heavy so I am impressed with this little engine  I will say though that the gas mileage hasn t changed that much on the car  except in cold weather  and it gets about 22 city and about 30 on the highway  At least with this car going to the gas station is a little less frequent then in my car  The handling  many many miles ago used to be pretty loose and somewhat stable and then I had more control over the car  As time passed and mileage increased the handling became slowly worse to the point that if my hands aren t holding the wheel with a tight grip the car doesn t want to stay straight and more and more the steering is getting very tight  I honestly never feel sure of myself driving this car anymore  You could say try an alignment job thing is  with this car you can t afford the money to keep up with the repairs  The heat in the car really can t be considered heat and the air conditioning in the summer is non existent and for someone like me who can t handle heat this a problem  There is also a possibility that this car also has a carbon monoxide leak and I have been encouraging my boyfriend to have that checked out as soon as possible  I really don t like the interior of his car either  It looks too cheap and well  it s just not as stylish as the newer models  The controls are similar to the newer models but the dash is just downright cheesy looking The seats are pretty comfortable though except it s very hard to use the lever to make the seat go up because those are breaking too  The center console is broken and even the ash tray cover at one point broke  which was probably my fault  The glove box has a lot of trouble staying closed especially when going over bumps  Forget about the back seat because with any Mustang you really can t consider it a backseat with how small it is  This car also doesn t have power seats or tilt steering so when I drive it  I basically need to sit on a phone book because without it I couldn t see the road  To top that off the wiper blades sit too high and can sometimes block my vision of the road The driver and passenger side windows are ready to break and are very loose and you can tell any time you go over bumps  The suspension is shot  If you hit a bump hard you are going to FEEL it big time  In fact  one side of the car appears to lean a little bit  With new brakes the car will come to a stop in a very short amount of time if you have to slam on the brakes but with worn brakes start praying basically  The car has a very noticeable  very rough idle  I have sat in that car before for at least fifteen minutes or more and eventually got sick to my stomach because of how much this car shakes  Sometimes at forty miles per hour the RPMs seem to stick and the car vibrates a lot  if anyone has any idea what that is please let me know  my car does that too  I will say though when you hit the pedal to the floor it makes a very nice sound  I love to hear an engine roar  even if it is a four cylinder I can honestly say that I wish he had never got it  The amount of money he has spent and still needs to spend on this car is absurd  The car is in need of some more repairs and I m sure of it  It seems like you can never keep up with this car  It s almost saying  quot please put me out of my misery quot  half the time  It would be easy to say  quot well  get all the repairs done and you should be fine quot  problem is  repairs were done and shortly after more problems came around  I know it is an older car and I know it has a lot of miles on it but for the amount of things to break it gets to be too much  The exhaust system  for example  was replaced and six months later it goes again and a new one is needed  The transmission even needed to be rebuilt but perhaps that was just age Maybe if Ford had made better quality parts that lasted maybe this car would not have had so many problems  I have written this as a warning to anyone who would consider buying a used Mustang of this year or before  You may end up like my boyfriend sinking buck after buck into this car just for things to keep breaking on it and wanting to pull your hair out  If you are young and just starting out like the two of us  being able to afford cars like these may be a challenge if your luck is as bad as ours  It is a nice looking car and a lot could be done to it appearance wise to make it look even better but I really don t think this car is worth the trouble  And with New Jersey s stricter inspection laws both my boyfriend and I are most likely going to have to take out loans just to keep our cars on the road to appease New Jersey regulations  But my view on these new laws is for another day     
Neg, Now I can t say everyone will have the exact same experience  but I recently sold my 92  Ford Mustang after it broke down 9 times in less than 6 months  I ve sunk well over twice the cost of what the car s worth into repairs  For the record  I wasn t the one who purchased this car  it was my ex husband s  quot gift quot  I m a mother of two little kids and we ve been broke down and stranded on the side of the road because of this car time and time again  I ve had to replace the battery  alternator  battery connectors  correct a short in the electrical system  the time belt  clutch  two tires  catalytic converter  and something that was wrong with the radiator and exhaust  The car s AC system would have cost over  1 000 to fix after it died out and I didn t even bother to check what the problem was when the heat went  I just got rid of it  To hear this you might think this car went through some rough terrain or was driven a lot  but it wasn t  To school  the grocery store  doctor s visits  and not much more  Now that I m in the purchaser s seat  I m buying a Toyota Camry  I have never had a more unreliable  costly  and problematic vehicle than that Mustang  If you re a young guy or a mechanic who doesn t mind walking or being without a car in spite of the fact that you own a car  then this one s for you  However  if you don t enjoy being stranded and you require reliable transportation then I would suggest your driving something  anything  else br br  
Neg, You know I think back to the nasty car I used to drive and I was happy to get rid of it  I think if you work really hard  you deserve to treat yourself  So at the end of 1999 I bought my mustang  I wasn t too crazy about the new body style at first but I grew to like it  I do have a few complaints however  I owned the car for a month when I started noticing that a rust problem that was beginning on my tail pipe so I made an appointment and brought it in  They replaced the tailpipe  They told me it must have just been a bad part  Then I started noticing that when I turned the wheel the car kinda made a grinding noise and and this humming noise  So yet again I took it in and they told me my car had no power steering fluid in it  How can they sell a brand new car with no power steering fluid  So they filled it up and sent me off  A couple weeks later the rusting started again  I made ANOTHER appointment and brought the car in  This time when I brought it in  I MADE the mechanic get on the ground underneath my car so I could show him the rust  I was starting to think I was think I was going crazy  He told me that my car had more rust on it than a five year old mustang he had just worked on  Luckily this time they were kind enough to give me a loaner since they kept my car for several weeks  I mean I paid for a Mustang and I spent half the time driving a Ford Taurus  If I wanted a family car I would have bought one  Shortly after that I joined the military and my car sat at home for six months and wasn t driven at all  When I came home to my surprise  what was there more of  RUST  I have since had the parts replaced AGAIN  Now the newest problem I have is my alignment  Which after I took it to the dealership I was told that it will never be right because the body was cut wrong   I have no idea what that means Oh and by the way  that humming and grinding  It s starting again a few days ago I m not saying they re all like this but from what I heard it s quite common     
Neg, Update on August 25  2003  I need a new A C compressor and coil  adding another  1000  to the repair bill  So in my first 13 months out of warranty  I ve replaced 1  Idle Control Valve  Summer 02   250 2  ABS modulator  May 03   1000 3  Rear differential gears  May 03   1300 4  A C compressor and coil  Aug 03   1000 Plus had to pay for a car rental during three of the above TOTAL   3 900 including tax and car rental I ve rounded down in the above  Plus you can add routine maintenance to that figure  Without my extended warranty  which picked up over 90  of the above  I would have been much better served by simply leasing a new car for 3 years rather than keeping my car for this additional year I ve also changed my buy recommendation from a  Yes  to a  No  keeping in mind that this review is for a 1999 car  If you are buying leasing a new car under warranty  go for it  it s still fun to drive   Original Review from May 2003 First off  let me say  I love driving the car  I have a manual transmission GT  when I don t do a lot of heavy braking  It s extremely fun  and there s nothing more satisfying during rush hour than blasting around some guy that s going to slow for your mood The main reason for writing the review is to share with people some of the less documented potential pit falls  My biggest beef with the car  and with Ford  is my braking system  Approximately 6 months after buying the car  and literally over night  my brake pedal went soft  I can depress it 2  without noticeably observing a change in speed  More scary than this  on an occasion when I emergency braked  the pedal went all the way to the floor  The ABS did kick in  but it was scary  And  if I brake heavily while the tires go over bumps  the braking pressure becomes inconsistent  not to mention that steering goes to hell to  needs support  I ve twice rolled into the middle of intersections because of this  It s been to two different dealerships over four separate occasions for this specific problem  and no diagnostics have ever convinced these guys to replace anything  So I drive on  If the dealership won t recognize a problem  I guess I just don t have one  right The second thing you may want to be aware of  is that at 45 000 miles  and a little under four years old  the car needed  2800 worth of work  The ABS system failed  I have no idea if this is related to my first brake problem  but replacing the ABS modulator did not fix that problem  and my differential fell apart  A bearing went bad and ended up chewing the gears there  Those  plus the rental car I needed during repairs  plus the 45 000 mile service  400  added up to my  2800 bill  I m also not writing because I m mad about the cash outlay  I have an extended warranty that covered most of this expense  I do think that  2800 is an extensive bill for non accident related repairs to a 3 or 4 year old car Beyond these things  I ve had my door handle tightened up as it was falling off and my clutch replaced  although that may have been due to me learning how to drive the car  and not doing the shifts correctly I don t pretend to know if this is a reflection of a normal GT  or I m just unlucky  I will say that I take pride in the things I own  and I take care of the car  Oil changes and regular services  And I don t abuse it with donuts etc   although I m awfully tempted sometimes  Hope this helps you potential buyers out there  As a side note  the seat head rests are useless  but as I point out to my friends  you don t buy this car for it s reputation of comfort or reliability  It s all about the fun  
Neg, I am a young woman and a first time car buyer who grew up around cars  I have always wanted a true  quot muscle quot  car and when I had the chance to purchase a new  99 Mustang I did  It was the car of my dreams  Well  actually a  67 GT Fast back was but beggars can t be choosers I bought my car in Canada at a reputable dealer and was thrilled  Not long after I moved to the city for a new job  I had never had any problems with my car and I loved it but as luck would have it little things started to happen Well  I have now had my car for a year and a half and slowly but surely things have started to deteriorate  I have had my heat sheild replaced twice  My side mirrors have been replaced because the gears that drive them have gone bad  My transmission is going already  There is a major lack of power when going up hills  For the longest time my brakes would work when they felt like and according to the computer system in my car there is nothing wrong with it  I am writing this simply to warn all prospective buyers  Please  please  please take the car for a long test drive first  Make sure that where you purchase the car they are willing to listen to you when you tell them there is something wrong  And last but not least  search the internet for horror stories on any car you are going to purchase before you do  You find out a lot more about a car that way then what the salesmen are willing to tell you br br  
Neg, The Ford Mustang has really made a great car with there new convertible and witht the hard top  The Car has plenty of power along with a great design that will turn heads everywhere  One of the best parts about the car is that it has a roomy enough seat to have an average sized adult sit back there  especially when the top is down  It is a little cramped  but much better than most other convertibles  It has an electric top which makes it easy to get out in the sun with just a push of a button  The car has plenty of power to get the wheels spinning  and you won t need to bring extra fuel tanks  it does pretty well on gas mileage  One of the down sides to the car  is that it looks as if the outer molding is very much like thinplastic  and woul probably break in an accident  However  it still looks really great  and for kids   or adults that act like kids  it is a great car br br  
Neg, I had a  95 Hyundai 5 speed and wanted to step up  What I really wanted was a  99 Cougar but the salesman was just too much of an idiot to deal with a women buying a car  So I went to another dealer  and he treated me well and I bought the exact same car that is in the picture above  Love that red car  The engine and drive train are great  The rest of car is the problem  The whole driver side of my car is incorrectly installed  From the dashboard to the door to the outside trim to the interior window molding  I have had them rip out my dashboard to find a rattle  they can t find it but we all can hear it  They have replaced my hand brake  They have replace the rear window and molding  And unfortunately  it is slightly better than when it went into the dealer  There are now stains on my seats  tools left inside  my manual is now under the hand brake console  On the up side  it is a guy magnet br br  
Neg, This is an update of my adventures with this car I ve had it for more than a year now  I ve driven back and forth to Portland four times  I moved once in it  I ve taken it up a mountain pass twice  and you know what  I don t like it any better  It s been towed at least three times  gotten two flat tires in a month  and had to walk or borrow other people s cars far too often  Just when I think I have everything taken care of  and am beginning to grow fond of it  the car betrays me again  It truly breaks my heart  A guy s first car should be something he can be fond of or something  not a POS that he hates with all his soul and curses regularly  The transmission fell out one and a half times before I just bought one and handed it to a mechanic  I have scars from this car  It hates me  too  I m sure  This is not my fault  as I loved it at first because it was my car  and it was zippy and fun  and it was wheels  Now it is my wagon of the devil and we disrespect each other equally Negatives  Maybe I got a lemon  Brakes go from fine to shot in no time at all  Front wheel drive makes it extremely hard to do routine maintenance on  The body is easily succeptible to damage  The tire and brake wear is very uneven  Positives  Does not guzzle oil  Once you get a good tranny in it  will wear for a long time  Gas consumption extremely efficient b Original material  I see millions of these on the road  and I notice that all of them are LX s  That s the model with a stereo and A C  I bought  about four months ago  a grey Pony at the beginning of the summer  It had a stereo and A C  Never do this  The A C fell out  literally  causing me to have to work on the serpentine belt almost all summer long  the engine runs really hot  and the seals around the axles gave out almost immediately  Once I got used to running this car without A C  it seems to run really efficiently  not needing any thing to be changed much  and with very little maintainence  I should also point out the speedometer lead fell off  and I racked up at least a 1000 miles that will never go on the odometer  This is pretty disappointing  My parents had an Areostar van they ran into the ground  and it went forever  I haven t even cracked 100 000 miles yet  and it s already sounding like it s going to come apart around my ears  I probably won t for a long time  but who wants to drive a car that sounds like it could fall apart at any moment  Doesn t impress the ladies much  For a budget car  if you can get a model like this that wasn t jerry rigged by some swine in a used car dealership  it will probably serve you well  My sister got a car like this  wagon  at the same time  only two years newer  and hasn t had a single complaint  so go the little extra and buy a 94 LX  You won t notice the difference  because you ll have a car that won t have anything perpetually going wrong  Before I complain too much  I should point out that I really like the lines of this car  and for a cheap pile of junk  it hauls pretty well  and I like it even though I complain Thanks for reading my opinion  
Neg, I drove a 97 Tbird on a long road trip in the winter of 1997  The type I had was a fully equipped V8 LX with every option available  This included leather  dual exhaust  moonroof  JBL audio  etc M overall impression of the car was favorable  but the sheer size of it makes it undesirable  Before I get to that  here are the plus points  First of all I simple LOVE the dash  The way it curves and wraps around the driver is something that is just amazing  It makes you feel extremely secure when you re in there  The guages and controls are easy to read and very logical in design  All switches and latches feel high quality Mechanically speaking  the car is a gem  The 4 6L V8 is a modualr engine that is found in other cars  i e  Mustang  so you can be assured that it is a tried and true motor  Service for it must also be rather easy to get as are parts  The 225 hp  with dual exhaust  it puts out are  quot push you in your seat quot  ponies that remind you that you have a V8  The taransmission is a little too conservative in that it forces you to floor it to reach redline in every gear  but fuel economy stays nice with that feature  The ride is smooth and quiet  Handling is typical for a big car  The rear end bobs and shakes a little  but absorbs road imprefections nicely  The rear wheel drive set up is also a huge plus point  FWD cars tend to be more expensive to service and require more services  i e  cv joints  Now the bad part  This design is basially one that Ford used since 1988  The first Tbird with this body and the 97 model are light years appart in refinement  but it doesn t look to be that way at a glance  Alos  big American cars tend to look really tachy after they age only a few years  I can t imagine spending over  15K on this thing and have it be a laughing stock of a car in 4 years  Acura Legend coupes would be a much better buy  even though they are FWD  Ford should be commended for staying committed to the V8 RWD personal coupe  but it s an idea whose time has come and gone  The reintroduction of the 2002 Tbird made to look like the 1955 model is simple a horrible attempt to retro a car  Using the Lincoln LS  which BTW is a import copy stolen Mitsubishi Diamante front end  BMW headlights  and Acura style front bumper  parts and rebadging them is in poor taste  I hope this car flops and Ford learns to stop selling  amp amp  to buyers  The story on the 2002 woudl have been different if they designed a V8 exculsive to the Tbird and REAL retro styling like metal dashboards  with airbags  huge white wall tires  and sealed beam look HID lighting systems  In other words  stop making cars look like jelly beans give the people FINS  and an exhaust that exits through the rear bumper br br  
Neg, The Ford Taurus has survived almost 20 consecutive years since its first year in production  that s more than many cars that have come and gone over the last 15 years or so  So why is the Ford Taurus so successful  It certainly has not received the best reliability ratings  the ride is anything but smooth  and despite being relatively cheap in cost  the Taurus has never offered an extraordinary value  On a recent trip from Eureka to San Francisco the  94 Ford Taurus GL sedan provided decent transportation  but not without the typical problems so often associated with the mysteriously popular Ford Taurus  For the  94 model year the Ford Taurus comes in 3 trim lines  2 body styles  along with 4 different engines and 3 optional transmissions  Trim lines body styles include the base GL sedan  tester  and wagon  LX sedan and wagon  and the SHO sedan performance trim line  The base trims come with an OHV 3 0 V6  tester equipped  and an OHV 3 8 V6 both producing 140 horsepower and both coupled with an AXOD 4 speed fully automatic transmission  The SHO trim comes standard with a 3 0 DOHC V6 when equipped with the 5 speed manual or a 3 2 DOHC V6 when equipped with the optional  new for  94  4 speed automatic   Driving Impressions i With only 55 000 miles on the odometer my  94 Ford Taurus GL tester felt like it was on its proverbial last leg  Off the line  acceleration  is adequate with very little wheel spin torque steer  however under full throttle the 3 0 OHV Vulcan engine feels and sounds more like an unrefined 4 cylinder than the V6 that it is  Despite being somewhat slow  it was the transmission behavior that was the killer  Under full or even partial throttle the transmission clunks into gear  letting the driver know each time it up shifts or down shifts  The worst part of this 4 speed automatic transmission is its low speed operation  When driving between 10 20 MPH and punching the throttle  the transmission would many times slip completely out of gear revving the engine towards redline  only to eventually clunk back into gear when letting off the throttle  I m not new to this feeling  I have owned 2 Ford Tauruses and a Mercury Sable in the past to find similar transmission issues  I have also found the 2002 models to carry some of these same transmission characteristics  Like many mid sized family cars in the early mid 1990s the Ford Taurus offers less than exciting  handling   The handling limits on twisty roads are easily reached making the  94 Taurus GL uninvolving and uninspiring in this department  Body lean roll and lack of feel in the steering are the main problems here  The General brand P205 65R 15 all season tires only aggravate the situation  While the Taurus finds its home on the freeway  it s  cruising  abilities still pale in comparison to much of the competition for the  94 model year  The base GL model I drove offered some of the most unrefined highway cruising in a family sedan that had an original MSRP of over  16 000  Engine noise is kept to a minimum  even at 75 MPH  however  wind and roadgrain noise are prevalent throughout the cabin at high and low cruising speeds  The  94 Taurus GL also suffers severely from rattles  and sudden jolts when driving over small imperfections in the road  The  94 Chevy Lumina and 94 Honda Accord both do a much better job keeping their occupants in a hushed environment when cruising on the freeway  back roads  or even through town  Hills climbing is adequate  I could not get the Taurus GL to go up one large hill in top gear  although once the automatic transmission down shifted  again clunking into gear  the car could maintain a decent pace  but not without engine noise  and transmission fuss  If a used Taurus is a must on your car shopping list  and if you live in mountainous areas  the 3 8 liter option is probably the way to go  This particular engine offers much better hill climbing power VS the OHV 3 0 b Braking  was also poor  Having a front wheel disc  rear drum set up without ABS can be more than adequate for many cars  however it made for some scary moments going down steep hills in San Francisco with this particular  94 Ford Taurus  The brake pedal felt extremely spongy  and I found myself many times flooring the brake pedal just to get this car to stop  my Mercury Sable LS had this same problem b Fuel Economy  is good  the EPA rates the  94 Ford Taurus GL 3 0 at 20 29  I observed about 30 MPG overall on my trip from Eureka to San Francisco and back  The fuel tank is 15 gallons so fill ups are kept limited   Interior Accommodation i  The GL model I drove was bare bones  no amenity options  just basic everything  no power door locks  no power mirrors  etc  etc  Dual front air bags came standard and so did an ashtray  Instead of a cassette player that comes standard with most cars in 1994 with a MSRP of  16 000  my tester just came with an AM FM stereo system with 4 speakers  A major gripe with the interior of the  94 Taurus is all the exposed screws in the doors handles and in the plastic moldings around the doors and windows  one does not have to look very hard to find these exposed screws  The plastics also used in the cabin are extremely cheap looking  Cheap plastics and exposed body metal around the window seals also contribute to this  put together with wood and glue  theme  Seating is adequately comfortable  but the cloth bench seats in the front provide no bolstering whatsoever  and the rear bench seats are  full bench  so they do not fold down for added storage like the more accommodating 60 40 split variety Interior room and cargo are by far the  94 Tauruses strongest assets  Unlike the 94 Chevy Lumina there is tons of head and leg room up front and in the rear  The Ford Taurus design provides very good use of the space provided  also allowing for a very large trunk i Exterior Innovation i  When the 2nd generation Taurus was first seen in 1992 it was all the rage  unfortunately by 1994 these cars were getting quite dated looking  In 1996 the futuristic yet ultra odd looking 3rd generation Tauruses arrived making the 2nd generation seem even more dated  While not ugly by any means  I feel the  94 Ford Taurus is more of a practical somewhat handsome grocery getter design than anything sporty or otherwise   Price Reliability i  New  these cars could run close to  28 000 in top of the line SHO trim  My tester had an MSRP of  16 000  today the retail cost is about  4 000  I have seen these base modeled Tauruses go for as little as  2 000 with the owner s claim that they  ran great  Reliability has been very poor according to my own research with the 1st and 2nd generation Ford Tauruses  This particular Taurus has had few major mechanical repairs as of yet  however  hoses  belts  brake rotors  thermostat  struts  front turn signal covers  and power steering lines had to be replaced in 55 000 miles of use  I would also like to note that the car is constantly needing front wheel alignments and I forecast a new transmission is already in demand i Final Thoughts i Like the infamous Hyundai Excel  the Ford Taurus has showed us what it is made of over the years  While it has provided flawless transportation for many owners  it has created severe headaches for just as many  if not more owners  It s not only the reliability issues that has lead me to rate this car at 1 star  it is its overall build quality  ride  and lack of performance  If you are in the market for a used car in the  2 000 4 000 price range  I urge you to test drive as many cars as possible  Some of my personal favorite cars in this class and price range between 1992 1994 would be the Honda Accord  Toyota Camry  and the Nissan Maxima Looking for a slightly better built Ford Taurus  Check out my review on the    a href content 75710631556  2002 Ford Taurus a    Happy Car Shopping  
Neg, About a year ago  my twin brother bought a 1994 taurus with about 115K on it for  4000  It seemed like a pretty nice car when we test drove it  so he bought it and it turned out to be a pretty cool car  his looks better because he added a spoiler  bra  and some chrome wheels  It is a sharp looking car  but he ended up having some problems with it POWER the 3 0L V6 is not one of ford s best engines  though somewhat powerful in lighter cars it seems at some times strained by the weight and size of the massive taurus  It does ride pretty smooth though  About 3 months after he got it  the heater core went out  It was a 400 dollar repair  Soon after they replaced that  the air conditioning wouldnt stay cold  They replaced the freeon  and it was cold  for about a week  apparently there was a leak or some type of problem  About another 300 to replace that MILEAGE His taurus does not get good mileage at all  at one time it was getting only about 10 in the city  Sure  driving with a lead foot was part of the problem  but 10 is still TOO low for a car with an engine of that type  He had the oxygen sensors  there are 2 of them in tauruses  for about 250  and that made it improve by about 2 or 3 mpg  Still not very good  only about 200 on a full tank RIDE COMFORT It is indeed a comfortable cruiser  The one thing i didnt like is there was no p ower seat  so after being used to the one in my car  92 Lumina EURO  it seemed kind of flat  The car rides pretty smooth  and takes the bumps pretty well  I have driven this car and I do not like the way it handles  The complete opposite of my car  It is kind of a fake feel  by that i mean there is no real feel for the road  You can move the wheel with your pinky finger  Some people may like that  he does  but not me  Cornering could be better  At low speeds the Taurus can pull U turns and sharp corners easily  Once you get above 15 or 20 the car sways excessively  Bigger tires would help  although the 15 s are ample STYLING Tauruses are sharp looking  although kind of bland  If you like a car that isnt very sporty looking and that blends in with the crowd  then they are for you  I dont reccomend this car  Apparently other tauruses have been known to have transmission problems that are very costly  If you want a similar sized and similar priced car that has been proven to be more reliable and just a better car  then i recommend you check out the Chevy lumina  just a 92 94  91 s had brake trouble Altogether it s not a bad car  Some like it  some dont  It has been known to have some trouble  but there are many cases of people not having any trouble at all  I dont really recomend it just because I feel there are better cars in the early 90 s 4 door sedan market  
Neg, Just a warning this is a review of the Taurus station wagon  not the sedan The car is nice  Not amazing  but nice  Its a good family car  good steering  but both the braking and acceleration feel unresponsive  The brakes have to be pushed pretty far down before they start working  and it always feels as if the engine is trying to catch up with my accereleration Furthermore  my transmission has started to die  The transmission is always banging into place The car  however  has been very reliable  It has 120 000 miles on it  and has only been in the shop for a new head gasket  It has not even needed a new timing belt  which  to the best of my understanding  is expected to break after 60 000 miles br br  
Neg, I knew that it was pretty the moment I saw it on the lot  it was so gorgeous  coming and going  I was proud to drive it  when I drove it  however  I never knew when I was going to get home first month  run sluggish when hot  we live it Houston  Texas  it will always be hot  that is not a good sign  however  frequently it would just not run  it would just suddenly stop second month  tire separation  we are cruising along the freeway  toodling along and the rear tire completely separates  thanks to some Firestones that came on the car  and not only did we get a flat tire  but the tread separation took the rear bumper off  lovely third month  motor mounts and wheel rotors  okay  fine  it was used  it had less than 50K miles on it  maybe that was reasonable  coolant flush  why  smelled funny to the mechanic  coolant smelled burnt  I blamed the service station for trying to pull a fast one  my bad fifth month  over heating  again  called Ford  nope  not their problem  whose problem  do not know  but FORD said not their problem  fine  sixth month  transmission  slipping on corners  great  I know what a V6 is supposed to sound like when cornering under a freeway over pass  this is definite slippage  high RPM s no increased acceleration  solution  new transmission seventh month  hard starting  wonderful  I am loving this car more each day  solution  new battery  this is not my idea of fun  I want to go out into the garage and just get in and go  I do not want to plan ahead each day for when I will need a jump start eighth month  more over heating  mechanic still cant find the problem  I am learning to nurse it by turning off the air conditioner and keep it going so that the breeze would keep the water cool in the radiator  it would limp home ninth month  rotor cap and wires  anything to convince it that it would start in the morning and not burn up batteries tenth month  serious serious money spent on the best truck battery  Interstate  that would definitely turn this car over the radiator eventually cracked  the head gaskets eventually did blow  out of warranty  and the transmission did go out again  all within 110 000 miles  FORD  customer service sucks  I will never ever buy or recommend any FORD ever again the room in the car was unparalleled  the class of arriving in this car was great  It is a pretty car  but sadly the car itself mechanically was horrendous  I am religious about maintenance  about repairs as soon as there is a problem  I have never hated a car before  but I hate this car  
Neg, We bought our 1994 Taurus in 1999 when it had 52k mi on it  The car was in pretty good shape  I traded it in today at 72k mi  In the one years time and 20k mi we have had the car I have had to replace the water pump  serpintine belt  thermostat  brake pads  rotors  brake lines and other various suspension parts I traded the car because it needed another  3000 worth of work  The AX4N transmission had justed started to slip   requiring a rebiuld to fix  The rear calipers froze and needed replacing  Since the calipers froze it ruined the rotors so they also need replaced  The front struts and c v joints are shot and need replaced  I also needed to have the engine looked at as the transmission shop informed me that it was giving some engine error codes also The car was a roomy and okay to drive  can t handle corners too well  I hardly can believe that quality is job 1 at Ford br br  
Neg, Dear Readers I think i have to start with a sad note  saying never dare to burn yourself buying this vehicle  I bought this vehicle in last September  I think i must have gone crazy when i bought this  I was actually misguided by its look for a 1994 model and the comfort it might offer for its size  Later realized it s nothing but money eater  What i like in this vehicle mm what could i say  Probably the size to accommodate more friends of mine who don t have a car  My list of hatred started with the problems 1  After just a week of buy i found that the engine bed bolts were weak and i had to change them 2  Two months later it was recalled for tightening the side frame bolts uh  i didn t know what it was and what the dealer did  No comments and details from the dealer 3  Three months later i had to change the rear wheel brake rotor  caliper  and shoes since there was misalignment with the caliper which eventually dug into the rotor disk 4  Now came the REAL BIG headache  The oil pressure lamp started to glow  I didn t knew what exactly was happening  Few days later i found out that the Engine coolant was getting dried up soon and also the engine was heating up sometimes  I am not a person who doesn t care for cars  actually i luv to do  Now i added higher viscosity oil  But after few days of oil change the lamp started to glow again  I took it to the dealer  then he confirmed my fate that my engine was no good  WHAT  yes the timing case gasket which is at the lower part of the vehicle has some defects and now the water has started to enter the engine chamber  Oh My GOD  What can i do now  Either replace engine or scrap the vehicle I tried contacting the FORD company  but nothing worked out  The company which was then offering warranty for Head Gasket leakage  didn t offer the warranty for this  I was helpless  And now my car stands in my apartment parking garage for no mistake of mine except for that I bought a Ford Vehicle From my perspective except for those people who lease the vehicle or take rentals shouldn t go for this when there are cars which could easily run for 1 3 rd s of your lifetime br br  
Neg, I own a 1994 Ford Taurus  granted I should have done some more research  but I didn t  It was purchased in 1996  so it was only a couple of years old  fairly low miles  and I had seen the blitz about how safe the car is  It s a family mobile  you can even window lock the car so the kids can t roll down the windows  nice touch  The car is a V 6  but sure doesn t act like one  it s pretty slow getting started  but at least the ride is smooth Here are things that they don t tell you  and it cost me dearly  My car started to have trouble getting into reverse  it was idle there for a bit  then literally  quot kick quot  into gear  it s scary  it feels like the car is shaking apart  Then it started to do that when I put into drive  sometimes it would stall as well  I was getting really worried  so I go online and start checking my problems  It seems there is a manufacturing problem with certain years of the Taurus  Some of the parts are made out of aluminum  when it should have been made out of steel  There were even some lawsuits involved  and Ford of Canada noted this as a problem and agreed to fix some of those cars  This  of course  does not apply to Ford of America  In fact when I called  they told me there will be no financial help for a deficiency in their part  So what was the resolution  Let s just say it cost me about 5 month worth of rent  I had to have a rebuilt transmission  If I had gotten a new transmission  I could be in the same boat again  it really wasn t worth the time  or the effort  I don t know  maybe I am a bit bitter  but I ll never buy Ford again  especially for the fact that it is a known problem  yet they do nothing about it br br  
Neg, I bought my 94 Taurus used in 97  it had 80 000 miles on it  After 1 year  the transmission refused to enter into any gear  This required 2200 dollars worth of transmission rebuild work  Four months later the transmission decides it wants to pick and choose when it will go into Drive  Turns out that a valve sticks  A little tranny lube solved this problem  Five months ago the surpentine belt tension froze  destroying the pulleys on the water pump and power steering pump  Another  400 dollars  One month ago  the headlight switch wiring harness completely melted  leaving me stuck at night with no lights what so ever  I recently ran across a recall list for this model year of taurus and was astonished  There are no less than seven recalls for it On the bright side  the engine has run completely trouble free  And the car is very comfortable on long trips  and with 124 000 miles on it  still has plenty of power Readers  please research your next used car purchase very carefully Brian   
Neg, The Taurus was a great car when we bought it in 1996  Low mileage everything worked fine  And extremely comfortable But then 1999 came and boom  At 100 000 kilometers the air conditioner quit At 120 000 kilometers the head gaskets blew  Then at 155 000 the transmission had to be completely rebuilt  This 1994 Taurus gl was equipped with the 3 8 engine  I have learned never to buy a product with the ford 3 8 engine  The car is now gone to the scrap yard at 185 000 kilometers This car was a very expensive lesson to learn Ford did rebate the money for the head gaskets But not for any of the other repairs which I believe happenned due to the faulty ford 3 8 engine Whatever happenned to cars lasting 10 years  Keep in mind as you read this article that I have used kilometers not miles 100 000 kilometers   60 000 miles br br  
Neg, I came from a Ford family  and after driving a sports car for 9 years  decided to purchase a 1994 Ford Taurus GL early in 1996  Finally  a nice riding car with lots of space  It did great for the first two years  After that  BOOM  At about 55 000 miles it started overheating  and the transmission did not want to shift into gear  That s when I took it to my local reputable transmission repair shop  It would cost  1000 00 to fix or  100 00 for a temporary fix  The shop says it was such a high price because they would have to remove the motor  and all the air conditioning equipment  I opted for the temporary fix  That part went just fine until I realized several months later that the transmission problem caused a broken motor mount  Now  I had a whole new array of problems  The motor shifting around caused a hole in the air conditioning hose resulting in  240 00 worth of repairs  Next a freeze plug blew  Of course it was the one at the back of the motor  so out came the motor again for another  1000  Lo and behold  upon reinstalling motor the transmission was jerking again resulting in a punctured oil filter  I m now praying that this car holds over a little longer until I can afford to find another ride br br  
Neg,  Ever had one of those optical illusion books with pictures that looked like an old lady at one glance and then a young lady looking away at another  How  bout the one that looks like a woman looking in a vanity mirror at one take  and then like a skull at the next  The same effect was revisited for me recently when I first saw the  2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac   Allow me to explain b You see  up until now  sport utility vehicles have been a well defined group  Many of them are built on pickup truck frames  i e  the Dodge Durango  Nissan Xterra  The Ford Explorer Sport Trac is actually a reversal of this trend   it s a  pickup truck  that is based on an  SUV   namely the Ford Explorer   For you automobile savvy Epinions members  yes you ve stumped me  the Explorer  was  originally based on the Ford Ranger pickup  However  the Explorer has since become more rigid and heavier than its pickup cousin  You can see how I had a tough time figuring out what to make of the Sport Trac I had originally hoped that the Ford dealership where my friend works would receive a delivery of Sport Tracs soon  Alas  it was not the case  So  I placed a call at a large Ford dealership in town requesting immediate notification when the first Sport Tracs rolled onto their lot  Sure enough  my call came and I was at the dealership in no time    Note b  Normally  my reviews are based on test drives that take at least a full day  Since this was a new model  however  I could only drive it for about an hour  which is actually very generous of the dealer  I plan on driving the Sport Trac again once my friend s dealership gets some in stock  When I do I ll update this epinion and remove this disclaimer  For now  however  consider this a  quot short drive quot  review i b EXTERIOR  10  I ll let you draw your own conclusions about the way the Sport Trac looks  What I have rated so highly is the  design  behind the truck  There is much to tell  so get ready Although the Sport Trac was built on the Explorer frame  its dimensions are different  it s  14 quot  longer than the Explorer  and about an inch wider  In order to compensate for this length increase  the Sport Trac was modified to  improve lateral rigidity  by 40 Essentially  what we have here is a Ford Explorer that had its rear chopped off and converted into a pickup bed  The bed itself is not made out of metal  but Sheet Molded Composite plastic  Supposedly  it can withstand 400 pounds of impact per square inch  so Ford claims it s just as good if not better than steel in a car crash  The bed itself holds 29 6 cubic feet of cargo  which is about 3 cubic feet less than the cargo bay behind the rear seats of a regular Ford Explorer  Optional on the Sport Trac is a cargo cage bed extender which increases the bed space by 22 6 additional cubic feet of space  In addition  you can fold the 60 40 rear seats to accommodate still more cargo  Whether or not that surpasses the 81 cubic feet total cargo space of the Explorer is unknown to me The  cargo bed seems like it can stand up to some good use   Ford tested the bed with solid blocks of concrete and not a scratch was found  Ten tie down hooks make sure your cargo is securely held in place  An available option you might want to consider is a hard tonneau cover that protects your items  Right now  they re hard to find but availability will be better soon  Another nifty feature in the rear cargo bed is a weather proof 12 volt power point for whatever you d want to power up back there  camping lights  compressors  etc  The protective flip up cap reminds me of the caps on outdoor power outlets On the roof of the cabin   Yakima  not Ford  roof rails  offer more space to stow your belongings  They can hold 100 pounds of stuff when outfitted with the optional cross members b INTERIOR  7  The Sport Trac has many things going for it in this category and things I d like to see improved  First  the good The  dash is one of the best I ve seen on a Ford   The instruments are clearly marked  and I especially like the black on white gauges  The air conditioner did well to cool the cabin in the 85 degree weather  The stereo system I had was the four speaker system  which was satisfactory  though I d opt for the 6 speaker option myself  Another clever addition to the dash is an industry first  a power operated rear window  A dial on the right side of the dash can be tapped for lowering the rear glass by an inch  or turned to the left to bring the window down all the way  All of these controls were well within reach  Looking down  I noticed the  floor of the Sport Trac is actually rubber  not carpet   This is great for keeping the car clean and according to the dealer has a hand in sound insulation  Another feature you might find useful is the removable portion of the center console  It s actually a soft carrying pack for storing CD s  pens  papers  what have you  A final clever feature I noted was a clipboard that flips over for a second cupholder  Neat o Moving to the back  the  rear seats are quite roomy for a  quot pickup quot b  In fact  there is a full inch more of leg room than the Explorer on which the Sport Trac is based  Behind and under the seats  there are small cargo compartments for stowing little knick knacks Having stated the positives  there were many things I would change about the interior  First of all  I did not find the bucket seats on my truck to be very comfortable at all  The water resistant cloth is all well and good for staying clean  but it doesn t feel that great on the skin  I also would have liked more lumbar support  there was very little  Another negative was the  abundance of cheap plastic   not just on the dash but everywhere  that is endemic to all Ford vehicles  When I shut the door getting out  I was met with a resounding  CLANG  and not the solid thud that I appreciate hearing on cars b ENGINE  8  The 4 0 L  206 hp   5250 rpm  240 lb ft  torque   3750  V6 is the same engine Ford uses in the Ford Explorer Sport  and  scoots the Sport Trac along quite well   I was impressed with the engine s highway acceleration  which I got to test extensively  The Sport Trac is rated to tow 5 000 pounds  so the engine is good for light work only b HANDLING  8  The Sport Trac s handling is very  sure and confident  for a truck  Taking the car into a large parking lot  I swerved it left and right  noticing very little pitch  Taking turnarounds can be accomplished almost at the speed of passenger cars without squealing the tires  As far as emergency maneuvers  the Sport Trac performs well  too  While driving on an access road  an idiot pulled out right in front of me causing me to swerve out of the way just in time  After I had recovered my composure  I was thankful for the Sport Trac s performance in that situation  and was happy to know the  quot soil proof seats quot  would be there for me should a need ever arise again b RIDE  8  The Sport Trac handles better than the Ford Explorer SUV  no question  The ride  however  is  more stiff than the Explorer   That may be good for some  bad for others  If you want a lofty ride  then the regular Explorer is what you seek  not the Sport Trac  That said  I liked the way the Sport Trac rode  personally  Yes  I felt the road more  but other qualities were pretty good  Engine  road  and wind noise were all pleasantly muted at city speeds  At highway speeds  road and wind noise made themselves known  As far as the engine  however  I had to look at my speedometer to know how fast I was going because it gave me little help  that s a good thing b RELIABILITY  5  The Sport Trac is brand new for 2001  so it has no proven track record  My truck s cargo cage rattled when I hit bumps  and I also noticed some weathered rubber on the seal of the rear window  These are little observations  but they may paint a bigger picture later  On that note  be advised that you should  be wary of any first year model   If you can  wait about a year for Ford to iron the kinks out  If not  you might find yourself taking your Sport Trac into the garage for unscheduled maintenance or recalls  Ford is not exempt from this dilemma  the redesigned Mustang  the Ford Explorer  and Ford Expedition all had numerous recalls on them their first model year  Having said that  while my rating of  quot 5 quot  for an unproven car may seem unfair  and could be wrong  I m going on past history here  and am just making a point  At best  all Ford vehicles end up giving you average reliability anyway Food for thought b VALUE  6  The Sport Tracs were surprisingly in good numbers when I visited the dealership  When I asked the dealer about it he said they were selling surprisingly slowly  I don t expect that will always be the case because I feel the Sport Trac will become immensely popular  This is something to consider though  if a dealer tells you they are selling like hotcakes and uses that as an excuse to jack the price up For a base target price of around  23 000  the Sport Trac comes in  a little pricey  when compared to other trucks that most closely resemble it  The Nissan Frontier 4 door and the Dodge Dakota QuadCab pickups come in  4 000 5 000 cheaper  albeit a little more bare  Load the Sport Trac to the gills and it tops out at almost  30 000  a sizeable sum indeed Ford argues that because the Sport Trac is actually an  SUV  with a cargo bed and  not  just a pickup with four doors slapped on it  the sticker is well justified  Well  I d love to agree with them about that  but the fact still remains that those changes are all underneath the skin  Aren t the basic functions of the Sport Trac equal to the previously mentioned pickups anyway  Don t they all make the attempt at blending SUV and pickup characteristics  Who cares where the starting point is  SUV vs  pickup  Remember that this is just my opinion  and I m sure others think otherwise  All I m saying is that the issue of  quot it s an SUV  not a pickup quot  is all a matter of semantics  these important differences notwithstanding  By the way  the Sport Trac won t always be the only  quot SUV turned pickup quot  on the market b THE VERDICT  AT FIRST GLANCE  WHAT DO  YOU  SEE b In closing  I think Ford is really onto something here as far as new designs go  The Sport Trac is probably the best compromise between an SUV and a pickup  That s just my problem with the Sport Trac  however  what you are buying is a  compromise   It s neither the best pickup nor the best SUV on the market  In addition  this is an  introductory year   and I find it a bit pricey   For these reasons  put together i  I would not recommend it to a friend of mine b  My opinions may not speak for  you i  however  Ask yourself  does this compromise fit  your  lifestyle  If so  then maybe you should give it a look    And when you look at the  quot optical illusion quot  that Ford s rigged up  play the game for yourself  is it an SUV or a pickup  Ford hopes you ll see something entirely different  love at first site   AVERAGE SCORE  7 43 out of 10  b VARA S PERSONAL RATING  7 5 out of 10    
Neg, Yes this is an odd looking sports utility truck with a rear bed just a little over 4 feet long  The bed is about 2 feet in depth and 4 feet wide by 4 feet in length giving it only about 30 cubic feet in cargo space  After awhile you kind of do get use to the look The 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac 4WD that are made after 6 22 2000  base list price is for  24580 00 without the destination charge It comes with a 4 0 liter SOHC V6  Fuel Induction SFI with 205 horsepower and 240 foot pounds of torque  The gas mileage rating is 16 MPG for the City and 19 MPG for the highway with a standard 5 Speed Manual with Overdrive transmission  The Automatic transmission 5 Speed with Overdrive gets 15 MPG for the City and 19 MPG for the highway When I drove it I was disappointed  it road rougher than I expected and it seemed top heavy on cornering  The performance of the V 6 was fair and it run a lot better when we run a premium gas in it The interior looked nice with two front air bags and a nice gauge layout for easy reading  The rear seat wasn t to bad  there was enough room for two adults and one child as long as the front seats were not all the way back  The back seat has three child seat tether anchors I didn t test the air conditioner  Too cold outside  but  the heater worked great b Standard Equipment  Air Conditioning Power Front Disc Brakes and Braking System with F R Anti Lock Four Cup Holders Power Windows and Door Locks A 20 gallon Fuel Tank Oil Pressure  Voltmeter and Tachometer Gauges Power Dual Mirrors AM FM Stereo with CD   Cassette and Digital Clock Intermittent Wipers Three Power Outlets And more b Cons  One thing I did not like is that the engine rattles occasionally using 87 octane  so you need to use a higher octane gas b Warranty  Ford Motor Company gives you 3 years or 36 000 miles Limited Bumper to Bumper and 3 years or 36 000 miles of 24 hr Roadside Assistance  There is a 5 year with Unlimited mileage for Corrosion Perforation b My Final Thoughts  I was really disappointed in this truck  If you want a Ford truck then check out the Ford F 150  it rides and handles a lot better and you can haul more  If you need an SUV get the Ford Explorer  at least you can haul people more comfortably  I had this truck for two days playing with it  I had the 4 x 4 version with the automatic transmission  they also make a 2 wheel drive version  I did not use it off road since it was brand new and not mine Ford makes some good trucks  I was just not impressed with the 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac 4WD  
Neg,  NOTE read this part of the review first then read the update  My opinion of this vehicle changed considerably over the year and a half we owned it  Thanks When my husband and I were starting our search for a new vehicle  we had several issues we needed to address  First and foremost  we wanted a 4 door vehicle  Second  we needed something with a decent cargo area because of my husband s sales job  Everything was steering us towards a mini van until we spotted a Ford Sport Trac it was love at first sight We test drove one at a local dealership and got all the specifics on it  Originally we were going to order one  but held off and our patience paid off when we came across a dealer demo that had all of the options we wanted  and a few we could have cared less about  We purchased the Sport Trac at the beginning of July and already we have over 7000 miles on it The model we purchased is a two wheel drive with the limited slip axle  6 Cyl  cloth interior and the option packages that include the leather steering wheel cover  fog lights  tow bars  16  wheels  cruise control  and the compass thermometer gauges   I m not going to list the option packages because they keep changing them  Ours also came with the cargo cage  something I wouldn t have purchased had it not been included with this one  but have used quite a bit  For those who don t know  this vehicle comes equipped with air conditioning  power door locks and windows and a single CD player radio  At the time we purchased ours  it was only available with an automatic transmission  Ours is Toreador Red and also has the running boards  Because we bought a demo  we got a nice chunk of cash knocked off the price  but since it was under a certain mileage amount  it still classified as a new vehicle Driving the Sport Trac is a very pleasant experience  while it doesn t drive like any car I ve driven  it also doesn t drive like a truck either  somewhere in between  Handling is very responsive with a minimal roll on corners  Even so  it has taken a bit of adjusting for me since I m used to driving Honda Civics  Braking is a bit soft to me  but that also may be due to the difference in the size of the vehicle  The automatic transmission seems to shift easily and has the overdrive option which can be turned off and on with the click of a switch  It rides very smoothly and from what I ve been told  if we switch to passenger tires instead of off road tires when we replace them  that will improve even more  Acceleration is very good  passing is a breeze on a flat area and climbing hills isn t an effort The interior is probably my favorite part of the whole vehicle  The two front seats are incredibly comfortable  I suffer from low back problems and these seats have been a god send  The drivers seat has the power adjustments which come in handy since my husband and I don t sit the same way when we drive and we can change it quickly  The rear seat is very roomy  one of my pet peeves with most of the popular SUV s is the  knees up the nose  scenario for anyone with long legs sitting in the back  I can easily sit in the back seat  I m 5 7  mostly legs  facing forward and not have my knees even touch the seat in front of me  It also has a 60 40 split for folding down and makes a very flat surface for carrying things you wouldn t want on the seats or in the bed  There are plenty of cup holders in this particular one as well  two up front and two in the back  guess person number 5 is out of luck  The cloth interior vacuums easily and I love the fact that you can take the berber type carpet completely out for thorough cleaning with two furry dogs it will come in very handy  There is also this neat little cargo compartment between the seats that is removable if you need to carry something valuable with you Interior noise is a little more than I would like but nothing you can t drown out with the stereo  I ve noticed quite a bit of wind noise around the windows  not sure if it s because the windows don t seal as tightly as they should  or an aerodynamic design flaw  One major plus though is the rear sliding window it can be opened several inches with the touch of a button or put down the whole way  Even opened just a few inches creates air circulation sufficient to cool it off on a hot day and it keeps the noise to a minimum  far better than driving with the driver or passenger window cracked  I ve never been a big fan of cruise control  but this one is very easy to use and operates very efficiently  All of the other controls are easy to reach too and take a minimum of know how to use with the exception of the windshield wipers  I think there are just a few too many notches in the intermitent section  just how many different speeds do you really need  In addition to the cigarette lighter outlet  they have added an extra one  something which is becoming more of a standard feature now in most cars but for the true sportsman  there is yet another in the bed of the truck for use with various camping sporting equipment  The sound system is very good while ours is only a single CD player  you can get a 6 CD changer with one of the other option packages  It is a very easy to use CD player radio and the sound quality is excellent for a stock stereo  With two speakers in the front and two speakers in the back  you can enjoy anything from a Strauss waltz to Metallica without having to change a lot of settings for maximum sound quality  I do wish they had included a cassette with this package for some of us who don t have everything on CD   apparently they have since changed this Exterior is actually very simple  not a lot of flash or trim and washes up very easily  While the bed is smaller than most pick ups  it is generally large enough to hold most things an average family needs to haul and with the cargo cage it adds quite a bit of space to it  We used ours to help friends move and got an amazing amount of stuff in the back as well as in the rear seat with it folded down  One big plus with the cargo cage is when it s flipped into the bed  it makes a nice secured space for hauling smaller items so they don t slide all over the bed  My only concern with this bed is that it s made out of this  mysterious composite material I am hoping it holds up with the elements and use Okay  on to the things I don t like  The biggest annoyance to me is that Ford has made it impossible to pick and choose what you want in the options department  If you want one thing  you generally end up with two or three other things you don t want and pay an over inflated price for it  A good example of this is if you did want cruise control you can only get it if you purchase the Convenience Group and also end up with a leather wrapped steering wheel  big deal  auto lock relock  which I hate with a passion  and the remote keyless entry with keypad  a nice feature for the person eternally locking their keys in the car  I guess from an assembly line point of view this is a great idea but for the money conscious consumer  it isn t My other big complaint is the crappy gas mileage  Ours averages between 18 and 22  depending on where we drive it and how far but apparently this issue is being addressed with SUV s in general by the government  so hopefully future SUV purchasers will fair better  A tip for any potential buyers thinking of ordering if you are considering the Estate Green  PLEASE go to a dealership and ask to see another vehicle painted in this color  Apparently the guy setting up the color charts is color blind  the real shade looks NOTHING like the brochure or any of the photos I ve seen of it  Thank heavens we saw one or we might have been stuck with a truck in a color we didn t like Overall we are very pleased with our purchase  I will be very curious to see how it drives a few years from now and if we have any problems with it  Before purchasing it we spoke to several regular Explorer owners who had nothing but praise for them I m hoping we are as fortunate UPDATE 05 03 02 I have changed my rating of the Sport Trac by lowering it one star and actually considered two  We no longer own this vehicle because of continued problems and poor customer service from not one  but two Ford dealerships as well as Ford Motor Company itself  In the year and a half we owned it  we had 3 recalls  had to have the wheel bearings repacked  something I ve never had to have done on ANY other vehicle I ve ever owned  and then to top it off  had problems with it not wanting to start  I don t enjoy being stranded someplace  so I had it looked in to  only to find that the idle sensor had to be replaced  The last straw for us was when we took it in for a 30 000 mile check up  We are in the habit of having the oil changed in our vehicles every 3000   4000 miles and when we took it in when it was right around 4000 miles  THEY DIDN T CHANGE THE OIL  What annoyed us even more was that they claimed it didn t need changed  I m sorry  but oil with 4000 miles of driving time is going to show some wear and it s part of the required maintenance at 30 000 miles  We got in to it with the dealership who couldn t even understand why we were upset  so we decided to file a complaint with Ford only to have some snippy customer service rep  I use that term loosely  tell us that they hadn t done anything wrong  When we asked her who would pay for a blown engine if it happened because the oil hadn t been changed  she couldn t answer our question  She was rude  and when my husband got a little bit huffy with her  her response to him was  there you go with that attitude again  EXCUSE ME  What ever happened to customer service  Apparently Ford doesn t know anything about it  Needless to say  within two weeks the vehicle was gone  we traded it in on a brand new  2002 Honda Accord  I will never buy another Ford again and I won t recommend them to my friends  They don t know a thing about craftsmanship or customer service  and for that kind of money I think I should at least get one or the other in this instance I got neither  I don t make a habit of getting rid of vehicles this quickly  but I could see this was one that would be going nowhere  literally as well as figuratively  fast  
Neg, I will begin by saying that I am not the kind of person who cares what a car looks like  I used to be  when my Probe was new  I d wash her  wax her  etc  Now I have gotten more concerned with other things   too concerned to worry about how a car looks  It has to be dependable  My car is  It s hit poles  just a tap  deer  walls  just a scrape  and guardrails  scrape again  It s rather small  but it still resists crumpling well  After the last deer hit  in fact  I didn t even get her fixed  Still drives fine Interior   Small  Can barely fit four people in the passenger compartment However  the hatchback fits surprisingly large amounts of boxes or furniture Exterior   Sporty looks  Gas mileage   OK   about 24 mpg highway  Only 17 or so local  though Electrical system   has been known as a trouble spot with this car Tires   wear fast   hard to keep aligned  That could be the horrid Pittsburgh roads  though  Lots of potholes Summary   I would buy it again  but I would haggle to pay a lot less than  15000  I would not buy it used  however  because I think it s important to know the history of a car like this  If it were a reliable car  like a Honda  I say buying used was ok     
Neg, As a new vehicle this was a grand choice  I have the V 6 LX Model which is by far a more well rounded vehicle than the Turbo GT Model  I have found the reliability to be greater than the Turbo as well  However all cars age  and the Probe has done better than most other American cars I ve experienced  but holds no match to a foreign make  Normal wear items  like both CV Joints have failed  as well as the car now eats  literally  brake pads  Some other items have died early on  such as the A C Unit has not worked in a while  and looks to cost over  800 to repair  Also the fan switch for the climate control has quit  This should be a normal relay  but everyone I consult as well as my manuals say I need Climate Control parts because it has a high tech system  However it does not have Automatic Climate Control to my knowledge  The body has held up well  just recently falling victim to surface rust  and that sin a harsh New England Climate  It has a leak in the rear  somewhere  according to Ford  that causes some havoc on the electrical system every now and then  To purchase one now would be risky  I would recommend searching long and hard for a perfect model br br  
Neg, It s funny  as I read the reviews for the Ford Windstar it sounded just like my exact thoughts I had when I first bought the van  I loved my 96 Windstar for the safety features  strong engine  low insurance costs  roominess  and ride  Then the warranty ended and the problems began  The cruise control worked only when it wanted the upper subframe mount broke  the ABS light came on  electrical short  the automatic locking feature would lock every few minutes the one feature that I have come to hate even when working properly  and lastly  and most expensive  the head gasket blew at 65 000 miles  2500 00  Ford has had many problems with the head gasket on the 3 8 V 6  in fact they have extended the warranty on 95 s to 100 000 miles to cover the problem  but I have a 96 and that doesn t count in Fords eyes  Calling Ford customer service  1 800 392 3673  is useless  sorry sir your file on this matter is closed I m filing a complaint with the NHTSA and I am writing a letter to Ford for reimbursement  Lastly  I would like to break down the overall rating at the end of this review  4 the first two years of ownership  1 for the reliability and customer service  dealership and Ford hotline  and for after the warranty period br br  
Neg, We had a  90 Caravan and test drove the first Windstar that came out  We loved the ride and quiet so we bought one  Big Mistake Picked up the car and two weeks later it was in the shop for 5 days to repair the A C  I turned on the a c and the fan blew all the vents shut  They fixed it but the car was in the shop for 5 days Two months later I turned on the HEAT and guess what  Only Defrost worked  They said the vents and passage ways for the heat were defective and needed replaced  Another 5 days in the shop All sent smoothly  except by now we discovered that not one roof top shell type luggage carrier fit a Windstar  Ford will sell a  70 canvas water RESISTANT tent type thing We took out 60 000 extended warranty  At 60 200 miles the transmission went and the engine gasket went  The re built transmission cost us over  1000 and they said since it was close to the warranty mileage  the DEALER would give us a little off the bill  Luckily  by now the gasket was a re call   why was I not surprised  I took the car home  1000 poorer and that week end discovered that my brakes failed  When we bought this Windstar  Ford advertised that it had more room inside than a Grand Caravan  After we bought it  I checked out that statement and found it was false I called Ford 800  to see if they d help with the  1000 bill on the transmission and the man laughed at me  I mean laughed out loud that I thought they d help   quot Lady when you re expired  you re expired  Even if you were only 2 miles over  we wouldn t help quot  I was furious I wrote to the CEO of Ford with a copy to Consumer s Reports  I told him the whole story and asked for help  His assistant called me and she said the exact same thing that the  800 man said  When you are expired  you re expired  The Dealer and CEO assistant said that they used to help people when it was close to the warranty mileage but the stockholders didn t get much money then and they do now  with this new policy I told her that it was interesting what she said and ironic  because we were leaving to go pick up our brand new Dodge Grand Caravan  P S  27000 miles later  our Caravan has NEVER been in the shop br br  
Neg, The Ford Windstar has both good points as well as bad  We were sold on how comfortable the car was to drive and ride in  I also have to haul equipment around in it so the room was also a plus  About one year after we had the van  we experienced out first trouble  It was strange  The car would not go in to third gear  staying in 2nd instead of drive or over drive  We brought it to the dealer for repair and got the surprise  No the car was not pregnant  we needed a whole new transmission on a year old car  In the mechanic s ramblings we learned that he had to do this kind of work a lot on the ford minivan line  While the comfort of the van was luxurious  the hassle of having to get a major repair so soon after receiving the car was too much of an event to convince me to lease another ford  The warranty of course covered the repair but I have to assume that this can happen again  the new transmission can from the same people who made the year old one  I return the van in three months and I think I ll get a fuel efficient sports car br br  
Neg, We bought our 1996 Ford Windstar minivan used in May of 1998 with about 25 000 miles on it  We immediately noticed little things that were annoyances but felt like we could live with it  cup holders which immediately broke  rear motor on vent window no longer working  chair arms breaking  The ride and glide of this van was great  even though the gas mileage was not at all what we had hoped for  I wanted this van because I wanted to keep my children safe  It replaced a 1991 Ford Taurus station wagon which had had numerous problems  all of which we attributed to Ford just having a bad year  All was well until right at 60 000 miles the head gasket blew  Because we were not under warranty  we took it to a local reputable repair shop and paid  1 000 for the repair  In less than two weeks I am driving down a very busy highway and my engine self destructs  Now we have to have a whole new engine  the  1 000 for the head gasket repair is down the tubes  and we have to shell out 20  of the cost for the  new  engine which is  in fact  a remanufactured engine  And on top of that  they have NO idea how long it will take to get it in because there is such a high demand for these engines right now because there are so many people having the same problem as I have had  I am thankful that Ford is only going to charge us 20  of the cost  and I am thankful that they are giving us a 100 000 mile powertrain warranty which will be backdated to the time that we actually bought the van  However  after this has happened and we have read countless reviews of this happening to others  not to mention the transmission troubles and timing gasket troubles we apparently have to look forward to  I go back to my original intent in buying this van  to keep my children safe  This is not the van that I thought I was buying Never again  Ford  Never again Updated information  Yes  within two weeks of getting the van back with the  new  engine  the transmission falls out  That sucker is GONE  We now own a 1998 Toyota Sienna and are very thankful for it  NEVER AGAIN  FORD  No wonder y all are having such troubles  
Neg, I will never buy a Ford Windstar again  Mine has been in the shop nine times for transmission work or front end work  As for the transmission  it shifts hard going into second gear  Ford told me this is normal on the Windstar  Every time I took the van in  they would do minor adjustments and give it back to me with the van still shifting hard  A month after the warranty went out the transmission went out completely  It took me threatening to take them to court before they finally fixed the transmission  I have four friends who have bought Windstars and three of them are having the same problem with their transmission  I am also having problems with the front end  I have been talking to a man that works on vehicles and he has informed me that the Windstar has three problems  One  Transmissions  Two  front end alignment problems  three gasgets on the engine  Two of the three I have had problems with  Ford has earned its reputation  Fix or repair daily br br  
Neg, I loved driving this van  I would probably still be driving it if Ford was a responsible and reputable company  At 80 000 miles my van started showing the classic symptoms of pending head gasket failure  My dealer service manager discovered the problem but could offer me no financial assistance even though he agreed the failure was premature and identical to the problem on various  94    95 model vehicles for which Ford had issued extended 100  coverage warranties  I spoke with the district office as well as the main customer service office in Detroit to no avail  Ford d only answer was that if I could show where assistance had been provided to other owners of  96 or later vehicles in a similar circumstance  they would try to offer assistance  I got rid of the vehicle before the failure occurred  Avoid any Ford vehicle with a 3 8 liter engine  Also  Ford has a continuing problem with faulty defective transmissions  Of my friends and family members who drive drove Ford vehicles with 3 8 liter engines  the following can sum up the experience co worker on his 4th engine and 2nd transmission  in law on her 2nd engine and 3rd transmission  cousin on 2nd engine   also had  2000 damage repair from defective subframe failure  
Neg, We have had so many problems with this van it isn t funny  The head gasket blew and was fixed before we got it thank goodness but who cares really with all the other problems we have had  what difference would one more problem make  On top of a ton of other problems  We had a check engine light coming on that was a cylinder 4 misfire code  We took it in had the spark plugs  wires  complete tune up and it didn t fix the problem  I took it to ford and they said that it was a head gasket problem  I decided to get a second opinion because we were not having any other symptoms of head gasket problems and the guy i took it to said that we didn t have the problem like Ford had told me and suggested a few other things  We first tried the coil pack and it didn t fix it  so we replaced the computer and it corrected the problem completly  I drove it about 500 miles and the oil light started coming on  flickering on and off  I stopped immediatly and checked the oil and it was not low  I went straight to the mechanic and he said that he thought the oil pan screen might be clogged   another  400 repair  and suggested I change the oil to a heavier weight to see if it could help first  The oil light went off and was fine for about 2 minutes and then the check engine light came on with a cylinder 4 misfire code  I drove it home and parked it for the night  The next day I was going to drive it back up and leave it with the mechanic and when I turned the key I heard a huge clunking scraping sort of sound and then nothing  The dumb thing wouldn t start  So I had it Towed to the mechanic and he said that he suspected a seized engine but will let me know tomarrow  It NEVER seems to run out of things to go wrong  I would DEFINATLY NOT recommend a Windstar unless you just like spending time and money at your mechanic for ENDLESS repairs   updated to say  that the engine IS locked  I am hardly suprised  I took it as a bad sign when we were looking to sell our van and 75  of them had either a new or rebuilt engine on it    
Neg, Ford sets up extended warranty program costing ford 200 million dollar in response to class action lawsuit covering faulty engines in 94  95 Windstars  Ford has since extended this program to cover additional models that have 3 8L V6 engine  tauruses  sables  mustangs  2 million Ford vehicles are covered but not 96 Windstars  Ford gives horrible customer support  Replacement engine blocks are in high demand and on back order  It takes Ford 8   11 weeks to replace faulty engines  Center for Autosafety in Wash  D C  is considering further action against Ford on behalf of 96 and later year Windstar owners  Stay away from Windstars  
Neg, Alright  so you re interested in buying a sport utility vehicle  Time to look around  The Ford Explorer   a great car  Size is not too big and not too small  Huge trunk size  Design is flawless  especially the 1996 model  Now  four door or two door  The difference in price is certainly one factor  but  let us look at the other factors My qualms about the two door The back seat passangers have very little room It s really no bigger than a regular car and gets ten times worse gas millege Basically  two door cars are just a big pain to deal with  from my standpoint Pay the extra cash for the four door  It s easier  nicer and just  overall  more convenient It makes driving enjoyable when everyone riding in the car is comfortable and happy If you are shopping around for sport utilities  also consider the Toyota 4Runner  my personal pick  the Niessan Pathfinder and  for a smaller variety  the Honda CRV  which  in actuality  is not small by any means   I test drove one a few months ago and was extremely impressed with not only the size  but also all of the special features that come even on some of the most stripped down models Happy shopping and drive safely br br  
Neg, Okay  perhaps this title is a tad misleading  Actually I ended my ownership of my paid for  Ford Escort  after about a year  This is a good car for some people  but read further to ascertain if in fact it is right for you  or someone you care about b Why did I purchase a Ford Escort  My previous vehicle had seen its last days  I meandered over to the local Ford dealership  While I wanted a car I could depend on  I was also seeking safety and reliability  and wanted a vehicle which was also appealing to the eye  I thought the  Ford Escort  was really cute  and it was reasonably priced  around  12 000 at that time  It is probably around  5 000 at this time  I purchased the  Ford Escort LX 2DR  which is the luxury model of the  Ford Escorts    The purchasing experience  The sales personnel were pretty nice and were helpful  I decided to pay cash for this car  and obtained a three year 36 000 mile warranty  However  we were not pleased when the salespeople and sales manager made us sit there waiting  playing games  for HOURS  They did not make points   Some of the comparable models in the Ford Escort line  2 Dr Hatchback GT 2 Dr Hatchback LX 2 Dr Hatchback LX 4 Dr Hatchback LX 4 Dr Sedan LX 4 Dr wagon The  Ford Escort  is a 4 cylinder of course with a 1 9 liter engine  The car seats 5  though of adults wouldn t be comfortable in the back seat  My  Ford Escort  was turquoise in color  had a c  air bags  am fm stereo  hatchback  cassette   Here are the features and availability from the Ford website  Anti lock brakes  not available Driver and passenger side airbags are standard air conditioning is optional alloy wheels optional cassette optional cruise control is optional There is not a full size spare Leather seats not available luggage rack not available Power brakes are standard on this vehicle Power door locks are optional power seats not available power steering is optional power windows are optional premium stereo not available rear defogger is optional sun and moon roof is optional tilt steering is optional  Here are some of the dimensions for the car noted on the website  Cargo capacity 17 cu Front head room 38 Rear head room 38 Front leg room 42 Rear leg room 35 Exterior Length 170 Width 67 Height 53 Curb weight 2353 Wheelbase 98 Fuel tank capacity 11 9 gallon The mileage for this car is excellent at 30 38 b What I enjoyed about the car  Other than the airbags for short or small people  see below  the car is very safe  This car had absolutely no repairs required in the period of time I owned it  I really appreciated the reliability and dependability  all around driving was fine  The vehicle turned corners well  and I liked the compactness of the car  and the ease in parking because of the small size  It is relatively inexpensive to maintain  I always have to have a cupholder  and this had one in the center console  as well as a change bin  The ignition is illuminated which is a nice feature b What I don t like   What I didn t enjoy about the  Escort  is it has almost no  get up and go  It is powerless  It is not fun to drive  It is not comfortable even in the driver s seat  I have a back problem  and if I drove for more than a half an hour or so I was miserable  The seats are simply not comfortable  as they are very hard  The auto transmission is slow  The driver s side air bag in the 1995 model that I owned was one of the first air bags that came out  This meant that in a slow speed crash it would deploy and anyone  child or short adult  under 5 7  or so  could die  This made me nervous whenever I drove the car  because I am 5 3  If I am going to die in a car crash I would like it to be for a valid reason  like a high speed crash  not because of a poorly thought out  dangerous air bag  The dashboard appeared to be made of plastic  It was poorly constructed  and frankly looked cheap   So  what happened with this car b Even though this car was completely paid for I couldn t wait to get rid of it  due to safety concerns not overall  but due to the airbag problem for small or short people  me  comfort concerns  enjoyment in driving  etc  If you are not short like me  and want an inexpensive  simple  basic economy car I would think the car is acceptable I now have a Saturn SC2  the sporty model  and love it  I feel safer in it  it looks sharp  it is fun to drive  has all the bells and whistles  dings can usually be rubbed out  so the insurance is less expensive b Final wrap up  This is a safe reliable vehicle for most people  If you are short or small or have passengers who are  you may want to really give this some thought  As noted  these airbags were the first out there  so could cause serious injury or death if they were deployed during a slow speed crash  I read this in a few website locations  The motorized seatbelts are a hassle  and the car is very noisy to drive  The seats are hard and terrible for someone with back problems  I did not enjoy this car  other than the cuteness factor  but it is reasonably priced  inexpensive to maintain  minimal repair problems  Obviously others love this car  but for me  I give it a two stars  well okay  two and a half stars  If you decide to purchase this vehicle  be sure to check out the airbag situation  as it could mean the life of you  your child or a small person riding in the vehicle

Neg, Real life comments on usability on our 1995 Ford Escort Wagon We sold our Toyota PU  for a family car  because we were expecting a child  and needed to be able to have a child car seat in it  We also are a one car family  Going from the pick up  which had good mileage and hauling capacity  we wanted a station wagon We picked the Ford Escort over the Subaru for a few reasons  but mostly cost and fuel economy  The Subaru has become a  quot sport utility quot  and the cost has shot up  while the fuel economy went down We have not been disappointed  The Escort gets good mileage  mid 20 s in the city  and 29 30 mpg on the highway  With a stick  it s zippy and responsive  We feel safe in it Ours we picked up used  45K for  5 500 in 1998  when it was almost 4 years old  We bought from an owner directly  But as I looked in used car lots  I saw alot of similar cars  in the  6 500 7 000 range  and didn t have as nice packages  automatic  no AC  etc  So I think we got a good deal  Plus  all we ve had to do to it is regular maintenance b Good things about it   are some of the features like the stock radio is nice  having a tach  and nice dashboard layout  It s got several dome lights and has power rear view mirrors  that make it easy for adjusting  It s also got a tiny  insignificant feature I like  a little arrow by the fuel gage that tells you what side of the car the fule lid is on  The front seats work nice  and the back has a split 1 3rd 2 3rd seat  for loading b Bad things about it   are that the car is a bit small  I m 5 10 quot  210 pounds  sometimes I bonk my head  but I don t feel  quot cramped quot  once settled in  And while the car seat for the kiddo works  my back does get a big tweaked from time to time  and she s had her head bonked a few times as well  I m not sure this car would work as the only car for a family with two teenagers  Right now  and until the kids are 7 10  I think it would be fine The other downer  is that the car sometimes sounds a bit  quot tinny quot  this is kind of unfounded  but my worry  it that it won t hold up over time  I mean  will I be able to put 200 000 miles on this car  or will things start to break  A few insignificant things are starting to show wear at 56 000 miles  My concern is how the car will age  will I see lots of this in the next 20 30 000 miles I ll keep you posted b Andr b br br  
Neg, Remember back in the  70s when grocery stores came out the generic canned goods  They were quite popular and then were made fun of  I remember seeing an automobile painted in the familiar blue and white generic color with the word CAR painted on the side The  95 Ford Escort Wagon LX strikes me as that kind of car  In fact  the entire Escort line strikes me that way It s a CAR  Nothing fancy  certainly nothing very desirable  But it has four wheels and will get you from here to there It has been a fairly dependable car  although squeaks and rattles showed up almost immediately  For the first year I had that car in the shop quite often trying to nail down noises that I felt shouldn t have been there Still  it has performed reasonably well  if not exceptionally  It has little pick up  It is not particularly roomy  The ride is rougher than I like  Road noise is pretty loud  But it gets you from here to there  If you are someone who doesn t particularly care what kind of car you drive   just need transportation or don t have a lot of money   than this isn t such a bad car to own  But if you re looking for anything with pick up  style  room  or comfort  and quiet then the Escort is not for you br br  
Neg,  Fine  I ll just go buy something bigger and nicer  Thats what I told the Toyota salesman a year and a half ago when we couldn t strike even close to the deal we wanted on a Sienna minivan  We had a Ford Windstar that was nothing but problems so I was hesitant to buy anymore Ford products  However  with a bad experience at a bad Toyota dealership  we went back to the local Ford lot to look   I don t think all Toyota dealerships are bad  you can see my review on my new 2003 Toyota Sienna  The salesman recommended that we look at SUVs as opposed to minivans since they tend to hold far better value than minivans  Majestically sitting on the front row was a good looking 1999 Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer Edition  I ll have to admit these vehicles are eye catchers  As we soon found out  with eye catchers  reality sometimes gets tossed out the window  We struck a lease deal and soon headed out on a long road trip that very evening  Thats when I soon realized what I had done              1 Problem    Gas Mileage  On the highway with cruise control on 65 and no major hills  you can get a whopping 19 MPG  Keep in mind  I m a Republican  but even those kinds of gas mileage upset me and my pocketbook   2 Problem    Control  The vehicle handles very awkwardly in curves and in situations requiring quick response  I often found myself trying to overcompensate for bad timing in curves 3 Problem    Cabin Design  Folks  this is one of the biggest vehicles on the road  therefore  there must be plenty of leg room and cargo space right  WRONG  The third row seat is made for munchkins  Seriously  Very minimal leg room back there  So then you say   Oh  That must be to make up for the cargo room behind the third seat  right  Wrong again  We have to sit our folded stroller vertically to make it fit  and then you sort of have to  slam  the door to get the stroller to push against the back seat so the door will close  Big disappointment 4 Problem    You get to know your service department personnel by name  We owned the vehicle for approximately 16 months and had approximately  800 in repairs over 4 separate incidents  Good thing I purchased an extended warranty   5 Problem    DEPRECIATION  We leased the vehicle based on a  24 900 base price  When we went to trade it in 16 months later the best trade in we got was  16 500  And that was a high offer from the dealership we bought it from because they knew the vehicle and had serviced it  many times  I m really glad I didn t pay the new sticker price of  40 000 plus Just so you don t think I m solely a complainer  I will share with you some of the good things 1   Beautiful exterior with nice paint  Definitely one of the best looking vehicles on the road 2   5 4L V8 Triton Engine has lots of power and can handle any load you put on it  Definitely would be great to pull campers with 3   Leather seats are tough and durable even with small kids   4   Probably the best factory sound system I ve ever heard  Beats most aftermarket stuff 5   Climate control and rear air make the cabin comfortable for all passengers To sum it up  I was more disappointed with this  40 000 vehicle than I was pleased  I m very glad to be the owner of a new 2003 Toyota Sienna  Our family rides much more comfortably now  If you still decide you want one of these monsters  I highly recommend an extended warranty  Good luck on your new purchase  
Neg, We bought a 1999 Ford Expedition  We had previously had a 1993 Jeep Cherrokee and it turned out to be quite the lemon  I did my research and used Autobytel to purchase the car  I do think that by using this service we saved several thousand dollars  After looking at all the different Expeditions and driving the 4x4  we decided on the Eddie Bauer edition  The 4x4 was a VERY bumpy ride and it sits so high I could barely get into the truck  We have loved the size  we did get the third seat and it works well for children  BUT the truck is extremely bumpy compared to our old jeep and other SUV s  There is also a recall coming up about the windshield wipers  they go off all the time  I do not think we will get another Expedition when out lease is up br br  
Neg, i recently got an oppertunity to drive an expedition in Dallas Tx i will admit it does have a good look but it s made by ford  I will also admit i have been a chevy man since i was a kid  The expedition does have room though the seats were not really comfortable   And it does have plenty of cup holder s  this truck is good for that mom or school teacher who like s to run a rat pack of kid s to their soccer or basketball game  It s loaded with options decent stereo with cd changer  when i got the expedition on the freeway  i was not impressed with the acceleration  It seemed to take off as if though it was a six cylinder  Now from my understanding these thing s come with a v8 which i believe is a 4 9 litre engine  Compared to chevy s 5 7 litre i know there is no contest here  I also noticed they have beenm recalled for tires falling off brake mastercyliders failing  and sorry gas milage  I wouldn t own one even if they gave it to me Remeber the four dangeruos word s kids  Ford stands for  fixed or repaired daily  So if you have been brainwashed from child birth to purchase ford motor product s flame on   If you are smart and do enough research   You will see how often they see a shop  Also note friends don t let friend s drive ford s see also www consmer reports com ford recalls  don t say i didn t warn you     
Neg, I have expressed my dislike of SUVs in many of my earlier reviews  but as long as my relatives continue to buy them  I will continue to write of my displeasure when driving them  Ford s Expedition is now sadly a  quot mid size quot  SUV despite the fact that it in itsself is a monstrosity  The car  with its massive size offers an unwanted guarantee that it will kill the passengers of any car you come into collision with  My closest friend s husband died in a collision with an explorer  a smaller car  and the child driving the Explorer is still emotionally wounded  However  it still is ridiculously flimsy  and suffered  2500 of damage once in a five mph collision with a garage door  Of course my biggest pet peeve is mpg  This car gets a ridiculously low mpg of nearly 10 in the city  I think it would be more environmentally sound to clear cut ten acres of rain forest then drive an Expedition around for ten years  As usual  I have experienced another SUV and grown to hate it  I recommend buying any car that will not waste fuel and kill passengers of other cars you may collide with br br  
Neg, My mother has one of these monstrocities  and I drove it for the first time a few weeks ago  It was the most nerve racking experience of my life  Going from my small Toyota Camry to the Ford Expedition reminded me of the mock suv  the Canyonero  from tv s The Simpsons  you remember the theme song   quot fifty yards long and two lanes wide it s fifty tons of American pride quot  I love all the features on it  led showing  quot miles to empty quot  or  quot miles per gallon quot  six disc cd player  auto climate control  blinkers in the side mirrors  and room for seven comfortably  It was definately powerful  and the power steering was very responsive  but I couldn t stop worrying about hitting the car next to me or the curb  In short  if you are a very experienced driver and want luxury in an SUV  buy this vehicle  if you re even the slightest bit nervous about driving  get something smaller br br  
Neg, I used to drive a 88 Full Size Bronco Eddie Bauer  I then took some vacation time in Colorado and decided to rent the Expedition  Compared to the Bronco  I HATED the expedition  It s a larger truck but inside it doesn t feel like it AT ALL  The parking brake constantly dug into my shin  It didn t handle NEARLY as well as the Bronco did  but thats not surprising being that it IS a larger vehicle  I even wound up sleeping in the vehicle one night and found it quite frustrating that 1  the seats don t recline enough to sleep in very well and 2  with the design of the rear seats  there is no comfertable way to sleep in the back  It s also too luxurious  I can t stand what car companies are doing to these trucks  If you want luxury  buy a bmw  if you want a truck  don t expect it to look and feel like car  Although I must say  my 88 bronco was able to outhandle my friends 97 VW Golf on dry roads which I proved when I wound up pulling him out of the ditch  br br  
Neg, After many years of driving a 3 door minivan  with three kids my husband and I decided go for something more practical  We both like the look of the Expedition and the fact that it has the third seat  We got to the dealership and we gung ho and ready to buy  I took it for a spin while my husband conversed with the salesman  upon my return and to the dismay of the salesman I told my husband no way  After he drove the Expedition he also agreed  We were reluctant to reject this vehicle because until you drive it   its great  The interior is well designed and comfortable but the positive aspects of the vehicle are mostly aesthetic  The truck feels narrow and  quot pigeon toed quot  while driving  rendering it a poor handling truck  The suspension feels too bouncy making the truck feel as though it were all over the road so to speak  especially over bumps  I drove the truck for about 45 minutes  and my husband the same  so in total we drove for an hour and a half and were unfortunately not at all impressed br br  
Neg, I was not in the market for a new vehicle  but my son was  He asked that I go with to look at the Ford Expedition  It didn t take long for him to realize he could not afford it  However  while looking with him  I fell in love with the Expedition Eddie Bauer Edition  of course and  behind my son s back  went and purchased one  Sitting behind the wheel of this humongous vehicle makes me feel like the Queen of the Road  The smell of the leather  all the modern conveniences  the sense of power one gets from controlling this huge animal and all the envious glares from on lookers makes one feel on top of the world  However  I soon learned that the cost of the vehicle  as high as it is  would only be a fraction of what it would cost to drive and maintain this animal  Unless you have money to burn  and a smaller vehicle for your everyday running around  I do not recommend this vehicle  After putting only 6 000 miles on mine  I was fortunate to sell it just as gas prices began to soar  I am now happily in a 28 33 mpg small car br br  
Neg,   Update 4 3 2002  I am downgrading this car to 3 stars   and will not recommend this car any longer  I have learned that there are four simultaneous government safety probes launched on this model  regarding such items as unintended airbag inflation  engine fires  and bad rear wheel bearings  There have also been eight recalls for the Focus  which I reflected in the reliability rating  I am also concerned with other Ford of Europe products  such as the bigger  Contour  and even the  Jaguar X Type   which were designed by the same folks and share much of the engineering and some parts  My Contour review has been downgraded accordingly i b Below is the original review from 2 22 2001  which I chose not to alter in any way despite the disturbing information above b I don t know why  but my Ford Contour seems to have a huge affinity for body shops  As soon as I brought it to Tucson from the harsh life of the San Francisco Bay Area  the car acquired another huge dent in the front fender   using the few drops of Bay Area gasoline left in its tank  it had been towed here  not driven  That meant I had to arrange yet another rental car for the duration of the repairs  of course after yelling out a few choice words on this final Bay Area curse  I was happy to pick up a brand new Cloud Nine White 2001 Ford Focus LX 4 door sedan  with a whopping 28 miles on the odometer  Although it differed significantly from the spunky ZX3 hatchback most of the other reviewers wrote about  I still found the car to be very pleasant b The Exterior  The exterior of the Focus has often been described as  love it or hate it  styling  It is very true   and for the most part  I love it  The very geometric shapes of the wheel well arches  the sharp and triangular headlights  and the fixed antenna mounted over the center of the car all served to give this car a personality  The Focus  developed in Europe just like my Contour  definitely looked the part  features like the center mounted radio antenna are very common in small European cars  and on the streets of Tucson where jellybean shaped Korean cars dominate  this car was a standout  Even the wheel covers on the standard 14  stock wheels looked decent  I must  however  say that the Focus sedan looks rather boring next to the sporty hatchback version b The Interior   Dashboard  The interior continued the exterior styling  with a dashboard full of asymmetric shapes and bold diagonal lines  interrupted by perfectly oval vents  Conventional would be the last thing to describe this dashboard  but I liked it  Although the dashboard was made entirely of hard plastic  it did not feel or look cheap  The instrument cluster was more conventional  and it was extremely easy to read  its legible letters  bright warning lights  and green backlighting bore a family resemblance to the boring yet legible instrument cluster in my Contour  Sadly  there was no tachometer in this bare bones LX  In the middle of the dashboard was a large emergency flasher switch  large and illuminated just like those on Volkswagens  Below it  a large  easy to use radio cassette player welcomed me  and even at low volume settings I could hear it clearly  although I felt quite some distortion at higher volumes  Below the radio was the climate control system  with separate A C and recirculation buttons and many options for airflow adjustment   just like the excellent systems in Japanese cars and Volkswagens  and a far improvement over the old fashioned controls of my Contour  And yes  the A C was very cold b The Interior   Seating  It took me a bit to get used to the driving position  but the seat was decent  The driver s seat adjusted for fore aft  seatback tilt  and seat height  I found that the seat somehow became more uncomfortable as I raised it  The seat did not hug me as well as my car s seat  but it supported me in the right places  From the seat it was easy to operate the controls  The steering wheel  while not as nice as the one in my Contour  was still good  with thickened grab points at 10 and 2 positions  and the turn signal and windshield wiper stalks were within easy reach  Next to the parking brake lever  I could even find a pen holder  I also tried the rear seat  and found plenty of headroom there  but legroom seemed a bit more cramped than my Contour  The seatback had a 60 40 split fold down feature  which was easy to use from the trunk  The trunk  with its high lid  was fairly spacious  but not deep  and thoughtfully it came with a fluorescent pull handle which trapped children and adults could use to escape   I trapped myself in the trunk just to test it out  and it was very easy to use  Even better for children  this car came with three child seat anchors above the rear seat   but on the other hand  the child lock switches are hidden deep inside the rear doors  and requires the key to flip b Performance  As the repairs to my Contour only took three days  I did not have too much of a time to check this Focus out on the road  Tucson s dead straight streets also offered little opportunity to test out the handling of the vehicle  Nevertheless  I drove around quite a bit  heading out of town to nearby mountain passes to watch the beautiful desert sunsets   and to test this car s cornering abilities  Although the steering did not feel as direct as my car s  it was still fairly sharp and responsive  and I could take mountain curves at 10 15 mph above recommended speeds without feeling the car lean into the corners  Too often I would find myself stuck behind a less nimble car  such as Kia Sephia  struggling just to maintain the recommended curve speed  On the other hand  I was not as happy with the powertrain  while the 2 0 liter SPI engine carried over from the Escort was adequate  the 4 speed automatic transmission was quite slushy and hesitant  By contrast  the ZX3 hatchback  reviewed by others here  inherited the more sophisticated Contour powertrain  including the more powerful Zetec engine  in the future I should drive a ZX3 for comparison  While driving  I found the visibility to be so so  the view to the rear felt somewhat limited  and the outside mirrors were smallish  At least the manual mirrors were very easy to adjust precisely  in other cars  manual mirrors tend to be too sensitive and finicky to adjust precisely  At night  headlights were fairly bright  both high and low b Workmanship Quality  It appeared that the car was very well put together  The paint seemed smooth  the interior materials seemed substantial  and I could not find a single rattle   but then  this was a brand new car  so it had better be quiet  Aside from a slightly damaged roofliner fastener  I saw no defects  I could hear some engine noise during acceleration  but otherwise the car was fairly quiet  Even the turn signal clicks were soft and synthesized   soothing enough to inspire a few poems  It seems that Ford strove to put the quality feel of a sophisticated European car into an inexpensive American built car  and it succeeded  On the other hand  this car also felt quite flimsy in many aspects  The way the hood and the doors closed and the way the car drove told me that despite what the Ford marketers may claim  the Focus is not a replacement for the Contour  Yes  this is a fantastic car  a superb replacement for the Escort and a formidable competitor to the likes of Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla   but this is still a smaller car  not in the league of bigger  heftier cars like VW Jetta  VW Golf  and Ford s own Contour  Yes  the Focus has more headroom than the Contour  but that is only because the Contour got saddled with a ridiculously low roofline b Pricing  As I put away my rental contract in the glovebox  I found the car s sticker  The sticker revealed that this vehicle was a stripped down base model  equipped with only automatic transmission and A C as options  The base price was in the ballpark of  12 500  and the particular vehicle I rented  after destination charge  was  14 400 MSRP  I think this is a bit too expensive  But then  Ford crammed lots of extras into this car as standard equipment  including a high quality cassette player  an electric  not cable  trunk release  fold down rear seats  power steering  and a large 2 0 liter engine to start with  True  I could find a car for less  but they would lack some of these features many people now take for granted  Besides  once I drop the  815 automatic transmission  even a loaded ZX3 hatchback with cruise control and power accessories could be had for the price of this lowly LX  and the top line ZTS sedan would still be under  16 000  I won t complain with this kind of pricing  And since the likes of carsdirect com sell the Focus at near invoice prices  the pricing will be even sweeter than these MSRP figures suggest b Verdict  Contrary to Ford s marketers  the Focus does not replace the Contour  But it is an outstanding replacement for the Escort  Although I was saddled with the rock bottom LX with lackluster powertrain  I still was able to enjoy the car s thoughtful features  European personality  and precise handling  I had driven a top line Focus ZTS last year on a closed track and was impressed then  and this base model did not disappoint me either Unfortunately  this car comes from a company that is mega obsessed with trucks  not cars  Visiting the Ford dealership where my car was repaired   and this rental was picked up   I could see hundreds of trucks and SUV s versus only two dozen passenger cars  Ford kept cheapening the Contour before killing it outright  and I am not sure how serious Ford is about this car either  I ve grown a strong dislike for Ford because of its role in creating and perpetuating the current SUV boom  and that will keep me away from the Focus  Unfortunately  at this price level  the only viable competitor seems to be Hyundai Elantra  another fantastic car from another company I hate  Of course  there is the option of buying Japanese or Volkswagen   but for a price  
Neg, After researching different types of small to mid sized cars earlier this year  I decided that the Ford Focus was definitely the type of car I wanted for myself  It was only a little bigger than my old car  a 1989 Dodge Omni  it had a ton of fun new features  and it seemed pretty reliable from the information I could find on the Internet about it  So  after applying for a new car loan from my bank  and finding the Focus I wanted from Carmax s website  I went in and bought myself a new car P P I was excited  I had all these new features  and a bigger engine to play with  My car came stocked with power windows  power door locks  AM FM radio  a CD player  and the new Ztech engine we had heard about  I was very proud of this shiny new car  showed it off to everyone where I worked  took my friends and family on test drives to show how great this car was  and recommended Focuses and Carmax to everyone P P And then  the first problem hit  Almost a week after we bought the car  on the way home from work  the check engine light came on  When I pulled into Carmax  I was brushed off by the service department there  and told that they wouldn t be the ones fixing the problem  it was still under Ford s 30 000 mile warranty  I was surprised to hear that  as when I bought the car  I bought it with Carmax s MaxCare warrantly as I ve had my other cars in for service there  and have been very pleased with the level of service  I was unaware that there was any warranty under Ford  I didn t even know American car companies offered them  but figured the people at Carmax knew what they were doing  and had them call up our local Ford dealer in Leesburg  VA  The next day when I picked up the car from Jerry s Leesburg Ford  I was told that a sensor had blown  that they replaced it and everything should be fine  They were right for about three months that is     Our first sign of trouble occurred on September 11  2002 when I was driving my husband back from his eye doctor appointment in Reston  VA  We were driving home  and the transmission seemed to slip  Having driven an old car for most of my life  I just thought it was a normal thing and brushed it off  but that weekend it got worse  After going to our local mall on Saturday  September 14th  the car decided to throw us for another loop  As we were driving down the road  the transmission started slipping again  more violently this time  and the interior and exterior lights started to flicker on and off  We got the car home as soon as we could  given the traffic around our area  and the next day took it out for a test drive  since Carmax   the dealer would not be open again until Monday morning  to see if we could pin down what was causing the problem  We drove it for about 30 minutes  so that the car would be warmed up  and then as we were driving by WorldCom in Ashburn  the problem started again  We hadn t done anything to cause a problem  but slam on the brakes when a bird flew out in front of the car     The next morning  this would be Monday  September 16th  we took the car to Carmax again as they still had not sufficiently explained this unknown Ford warranty to us  Again  we were told to go to the Ford dealer as Carmax wouldn t touch it  So  I called into work telling them I would be late  and we went over to the Koons Ford in Sterling  VA to drop the car off  I got a call from them later that afternoon telling me that the service technicians were unable to find any problems with the car and could we please come in for a test drive the following morning  So  my husband and I got up extra early that Tuesday  this would be September 17th  and went on a rather lengthy test drive with the technician  and still the problem did not occur again  At this point  the technicians were being extremely helpful  and said that if we didn t mind having extra miles put on the car  the technician would drive it to and from his home in Front Royal that evening to see if it occurred during his drive  The next morning  still nothing was found  and we were forced to pick up the car that afternoon with no resolution P P  Surprisingly though  the car behaved alright for the next couple of days  and didn t exhibit any more signs of failing until Saturday  September 21st when the car started doing the same things it had done to us on Saturday  September 14th  except that it was also making the gages on the dash go up and down making it look like we were doing 120 mph at a stop light  Luckily for us  the Koons Ford service department was still open that Saturday afternoon  so we drove the car in as it was breaking down so they could visibly see what it was doing  The service department at Koons took the car in right away  and about a half hour later  we were told that the car s alternator was dead  So  we waited until about 5 30 p m  as we were promised they would have the car all fixed up by the close of business that afternoon  and went to go visit Matt in the service department  He told us that the car wasn t finished yet  and offered to give us a loaner so we would have transportation until we could pick the car up on Monday P P  We picked up the car Monday morning  and it drove wonderfully until Friday  September 27th  I was driving with my husband to our local Enterprise car rental agency  so we could pick up a rental car for that weekend for a family get together  when the check engine light came on in the car again  Clearly upset  I drove the car back to Koons Ford that morning and demanded they fix the car this time  They took the car in  and later I was told that another sensor in the engine had blown  but it was fixed  I picked up the car on September 30th  and again the car seemed fine for awhile  and then it started doing the same thing it had been doing back when this whole thing started     On Friday  October 25th  on the way home from my husband s oral surgery  the car s transmission started slipping  the interior and exterior lights blinked on and off  and all the gages on the dash shot up and then went back down to normal  Since my husband was still somewhat sedated  I decided to wait until the next morning to take the car to Koons Ford  That Saturday  I took the car in and told them to call me when they had it fixed  About 4 00 p m  on Saturday  October 27th  we received a call from the dealer telling us that what was wrong was a loose ground wire and they fixed it and the car was ready for pick up  It sounded plausible  so we piled into one of our friend s cars  as my husband could still not drive yet  and picked up the car P P  Again  the car drove ok for awhile  I ran into a little difficulty on Wednesday  October 30th on my way to the National Zoo from work while I was sitting in traffic on the Beltway  but I thought it was just my imagination  and tried to convince myself that the car could not be breaking down again after all of that  Well  there s only so much you can brush off because on Saturday  November 9th  the car started exhibiting the same exact signs as before  And as before  we drove it straight back to Koons Ford in Sterling to be fixed  I just got a message on my voicemail at work this morning that they can t find anything wrong with the car  but they will check again today  and see if anything shows up     So  my shiny new car that I was so proud of back in May has turned into my worst nightmare  This is unfortunately not the first time I ve had this kind of trouble  I had a 1995 Dodge Intrepid that cost us a lot of money in repairs  but this Focus only has 23 000 miles on it  I can t even imagine what horrors await me when it hits 50 000     I would only recommend the 2001 Ford Focus ZX3 to someone who doesn t plan on driving it much or who wants to learn how to fix some of these newer cars  This car has proven to be very unreliable for people who need a reliable car to drive to and from work and take care of their family  The car looks great  and when it works  it drives like a dream  but who buys a car to have it in the shop all the time  
Neg, You may have read my initial review of the 2001 Focus ZX3 where I lauded the car s impressive features for the price  impressive handling  styling and comfort  To say I am  dissappointed  Six months and 7 000 miles into my ownership experience  is a gross understatement This vehicle has spent 16 days in the shop because of a variety of fuel system and transmission problems   5spd manual  The dealership initially insisted that there was nothing wrong with the transmission and that they could not duplicate my complaint  After doing exhaustive internet research  I found that the transmission problem affects ALMOST EVERY Focus with the 5 speed manual  I also found that although Ford initially denied there was any such problem  the company has recently issued a service bulletin regarding  gear rollover noise Gear rollover causes a distinct chattering from the transmission  The car sounds like an old diesel engine  There is no doubt that the noise will substantially impair the trade or resale value of this car and it suggests that a more serious transmission problem is yet to come  Ford says the noise is  normal  Gas consumption is MUCH less than Ford claims under all driving conditions The engine loses RPM and stumbles  as if it s going to stall  at almost every traffic light  My dealer has been unable to fix the stumble There is a noise coming form the cargo area which sounds like a mechanic left a wrench or something inside the body I am filing for the lemon law hearing this week  I highly suggest you run a word search in the USENET archives and check out the problems people are reporting with their Focus  
Neg, In all fairness to Ford and people who rated the Focus highly  I rated mine on a rental car  It was a basic model  with automatic trans  but plain interior  Perhaps the one I rented wasn t typical of all models  Also  I tend to base my opinion about cars on my 1990 Toyota Camry  and this is probably unfair to American car manufacturers  read that anyway you want b Some positives about the car b I liked the size of the car   very compact b  but with ample room for up to four people  The front seats had plenty of headroom due to the high profile of the car The  trunk was exceptionally large  for a car this size The car  turned around in literally no space at all b  It has a very tight turning radius Gas mileage appeared to be very good  but I didn t actually keep track b The things I didn t like b First of all  who in Ford gets paid to style these things  Maybe it s just not my cup of tea  but I think  the style  to quote my 12 year old  sucks b The car was quiet enough in the city  but on the road  Getouttahere  New York construction sites are quieter  I heard that  droning road noise b  especially from the rear  long enough to put me in a straight jacket The dash board looks like Ford had stock in a plastics company  Maybe the bulk was supposed to impress me   but it looked downright ugly b  The high rear deck caused me problems when looking in the rear view mirror b Road handling on the highway didn t impress me b  It had minimal pickup and I didn t care for the road feel  I kept the car at around 70 mph  and it seemed to be straining to go faster  The Focus seemed to wander too much and not give me a firm steering feel I didn t find the dash buttons  door locks  radio controls  etc  to be exceptional  In fact  the radio seemed to have two volume positions  off and loud  There was no in between  and with today s rock that I had to listen to for hours  well  I think you know my feelings b Bottom line b  the car simply didn t math up to my 1990 Toyota Camry in any category  In fact  if I were making a choice in buying a low price car  I would look to a 1997 Camry or Honda for a much better value  
Neg, This car is a lemon  plain and simple My wife and I bought the car in April 2001  to replace an Escort that had just ended it s lease  and we had no trouble with Brake problems Within the car s first week  the brakes were grinding  We took it in to the dealer  where we were told  That s normal  Focuses do that Within 6 000 miles  the front and rear brakes needed to be replaced  Originally the Ford dealer tried to charge us for the repair  but after arguing for about an hour and having to explain to them why the rear brakes should NEVER have to be replaced after 5 000 miles  they finally did the work as warranty 14 000 miles  we had the same problem  Again  the dealer tried to charge us to fix the brakes  and again we refused  The dealer went so far as to suggest that the problem is that my wife drives the car most of the time  and since she s a female she was probably  feathering  the brake pedal causing them to wear out quickly 20 000 miles  we had to replace front and rear brakes AGAIN  This time  At a different dealer  they put on heavy duty brake pads and rotors that have lasted so far  50 000 miles on the car now  They tried charging us for the work  but I went in with a stack of about 100 pages of printouts from http www fordfocusbrakeproblems com and the NHTSA website of customer complaints exactly like ours  They finally comped the service Poor mileage Ford bills this car as an economy car  We ve NEVER gotten over 22mpg average on a tank of gas  We took it back to Ford after having the car for about a month  and they told us that is normal  We asked why the window sticker said it would get over 30mpg  but was getting under 20 at the time  They said the sticker is just an estimate  and cars usually get far less than the window sticker says We took the car back to two other dealers for the same fuel mileage problems  and not once could they identify a problem After the car s warranty expired  I looked into it myself  Within half an hour  I found a vacuum tube coming from the exhaust manifold that had been manufactured with a hole in it  I replaced the tube with a new one  and the car instantly ran better and started getting about 5mpg better  Not one of the three dealers I had taken the car to was able to find it Other problems we ve had Radio turns itself off and on occassionally  usually on long trips  We ve had the radio replaced twice  with no success Passenger side headlight burns out after about a week  It just started doing this about a month ago  but I m not bothering trying to fix it since I m turning the car in this week A thumping noise comes from the front suspension when going over bumps  There was a recall for this  and I took it in  The thumping stopped for a few months  but started up again  Ford claims they can t hear it Our rear passenger side window fell into the door a few weeks ago  and of course it did it while it was pouring down rain  I had to try to fix it in the rain too  The cable that pulls the window up and down is attached by a flimsy plastic piece that broke off  The window is currently being held up by a piece of wood I wedged inside the door Our transmission will downshift for no reason  I ve had the car on cruise control  on a flat freeway  and the transmission will downshift itself  race the engine for a few seconds  and then upshift again  It does this pretty frequently On the freeway  the plastic moulding around the rear wheelwell came loose and was barely hanging on  I had to stop  and snap the piece back on The passenger side air bag cover has started opening up three times  All three times  we had to take the car in and they fixed it The a pillar trim on the driver side came loose  and was about to fall off  The dealer replaced it Both rear seatbelts have malfunctioned  The passenger side seatbelt doesn t latch securely  and will often times undo itself  The driver s side rear seatbelt will often lock after being pulled out about 12 inches  which makes it useless and unuseable  When it does that  it will stay locked for several hours  so anyone sitting there can t use the seatbelt on that trip  Of course the Ford dealers were unable to duplicate either of those problems Our trunk opens itself randomly  We ll be driving down the street  and the door ajar light will come on  The Ford dealer claims that is impossible  and told me that I was probabbly accidentally hitting the trunk release button on the dashboard without knowing it Our windshield was hit by a small piece of gravel on the freeway  Instead of creating a small pit  it caused a large crack that runs across the entire windshield  This thing has a horrible resale value  In late 2003  the Kelly Blue Book wholesale value of the car is about  4 500  That s for a 2 5 year old car that started out costing  13 000 more The only good thing about this car is it is pretty roomy for a small  economy  car  I m 6 3  and fit fairly comfortably in it If you want to read hundreds of other horror stories from Focus owners  check out the following two web sites http www fordfocusbrakeproblems com and http nhtsa gov   Go to the section to review customer complaints and defect investigations Three days ago we bought a 1996 conversion van to replace the Focus with  We have almost a year left on our lease  but we opted to pay the remainder of the lease off so that we could get into something safer and more reliable  As soon as we get the check from the bank to pay off the Focus  it will be going back to Ford  Good riddance  
Neg, This car was awarded European Car of the Year and the North American Car of the Year  I was so impressed by these accolades and the positive magazine reviews that I purchased a silver ZX3 in May  2001  It only took a few months for it to be transformed into lemonade My family and friends warned me and I didn t listen  After owning 6 European cars in 10 years  I did something I vowed to never do  purchase an American car  Problems occurred with my vehicle within the first month  A loud creaking sound was evident from the rear of the car when turning corners  After a few unsuccessful attempts of the dealership trying to fix this  one of Ford s engineers from Detroit was flown in  Spot welds in the rear chassis were drilled out and replaced with rivets  This DID NOT fix the problem  Since nearly the entire interior was disassembled to resolve the creaking problem  more squeaks and rattles were now present from the plastic trim panels coming apart There were a few driveability concerns with the car that were also not resolved  The car died while driving 4 times and often felt like it was going to die when approaching a stop light  The gearshift lever  manual transmission  would often stick and not go into 4th gear  On cold winter mornings  2nd and 4th gears had to be bypassed for the first few minutes of driving because the lever would not go into the gears  The dealership could not find any problem The car is rated 25 City  33 Highway miles gallon and I never saw anything close to this  I drove 60 70 on the interstate daily and never averaged more than 24 mpg  The dealer said this was normal All in all  my Focus ZX3 was at the dealer 6 times in the first 6 months of ownership for a whopping total of 43 business days  I contacted Ford s Dispute Settlement Board and asked them to repurchase my vehicle under the Lemon Law  They reviewed my case and a few months later Ford offered to replace my car with a brand new Focus or apply my money spent toward any new Ford product  I stood my ground and told them I would never buy another Ford and wanted my money back  My case was heard before the board and I won  Weeks later  a check was cut and I was refunded full purchase price including tax  title  and license  Based upon my experiences and a few of my friends that own Focuses  I try to sway everyone I know away from a the car  The initial price of the Focus is low  but so is the quality  If you really need a NEW car and don t have much to spend  you d be better off with a Hyundai  But better yet  purchase a 1 2 3 year old Honda or Toyota and have a great car without the headaches of a Focus  
Neg, http www geocities com archangel jjn I really loved this car it was small and fun until the cowl cover cracked and it leaked into the passenger footwell every time it rained or I went to the car wash moisture entered the headlight and it needed to be replaced the cruise control stopped functioning the rear wheel bearings needed to be replaced due to a recall the wiper motor stopped working in the winter and needed to be replaced and before I owned it it needed new brake pads and rotors despite having less than 15 000 miles a new transmission and associated cooling hoses a new hatch strut and finally  after only having it 7 months and still being well within original factory warranty  it caught fire all by itself by a recall that happened 4 months after my incident  It ended up being totaled  See the pictures at http www geocities com archangel jjn So far  Ford s basic response is that it is an insurance issue  so if you think your car is protected by factory warranty against catastrophic failure  even from an issue covered by a recall  think again they ll leave you out swinging in the breeze  and you re left with only your insurance payout on the rapidly shrinking book value to pick up and start over  
Neg, When it came time to replace my well worn 1987 Jetta  I wanted a hatchback  and the most logical choice was a Golf  Apon seeing the hatchback version of the Focus  however  I decided to up the list of consideration to 2  After test driving both cars  I found the Focus was by far the better deal  and walked out of the dealership with a brand new 5 speed 3 door hatchback  with the racy sounding zx3 badge  with a c  alloy wheels  cd stereo  and  rather useless  fog lamps for  3000 less than a Golf with only a c  The focus is a great small car  on driving alone  it is by far the best small car offered in America  the interior wouldn t be out of place in a luxury badge  the car is pleasent to drive  very quiet even at highway speeds  My only complaint  a car this size should get even better gas mileage  though it averages about 29 mpg highway  in city driving it can be much lower  this with the 5 speed standard transmission  not much better than the pinto ford built almost 30 years ago  A few months of living with the Focus and I was sure this was the best economic choice I had ever made Then came the recalls BEginning with an axel related problem  i ve had 2 announced  and 2 pending recalls of the focus  WHile the dealers are quick to correct the situation  having to make a special trip and arrangements  both recalls required leaving the car all day  with no loner  was not what i expected from a new car  In addition  The car has refused to start 3 different times and stalled out once  the dealer is clueless as to the source of the problem  I ve had the Focus for over 2 years now  and am approaching the end of my warranty mileage  and wonder if I ll be put in a situation where I have to dish out my own money to fix future problems  That said  having driven friends vw s  honda s and saturns  the focus feels like a car in a higher price range than these  but it lacks the problem free nature these cars seem to have  Advice  Buy with caution  the 2003 models offer a 100K warranty  
Neg, My wife bought this car in 2001 and at first  within the first 5000 miles  the car seemed like a decent choice for a small sedan  But in the last year or so  we have regretted the day we signed the loan papers on this close to being a lemon  Here s why  Please note the Focus in question has 32 200 miles on it currently 1  Loud  weak Engine  even when this car is driven at speeds less than 30 mph  there is a pronounced loud drone of the engine  At freeway speeds  gt 55 mph  the engine noise is as loud as a delivery truck  Yes  this is a 4 cylinder vehicle that struggles to accelerate rapidly and labors to do anything  But the problem is not simply due to being 4 cylinders  In comparison to our other car a 2000 Honda Civic  4 cylinders  the Civic appears to be a V6 and the engine noise is not 1 4 as loud 2  Bizarre problems  including a trunk door that takes TWO slams of the lid to close down from THREE after a trip to the Ford mechanic  A gas gauge that never shows FULL even when the tank is full leaving the pump  This was due to bad gauge sensor anther trip to the Ford mechanic  In addition the fuel pump on this car went out at 26 000 miles  Trip number 3 to the Ford mechanic  The brakes and engine belts squeak horribly whenever the outside humidity goes much above 50  The belt squeaking is especially embarassing  I ve had people at stopped traffic signals ask me to roll my window down to say   Excuse me  but is there something wrong with your car sir 3  Poor fabric in seats where everything  Lint  hair  etc  sticks to like a magnet  We ve tried the most powerful industrial strength vacuums out there with no luck 4  Rapid depreciation  the bottom line is if you buy a Focus expect to keep it awhile as it depreciates at a rate much faster than your average car  We owe in excess of  10k on the loan  according to Edmunds com the car is worth about  6400 for a trade in 8200 if sold privately a loss either way we might choose to sell it 5  Driving comfort  the ride for this car is stiff and the front drivers and passengers seats are cramped  At higher speeds  gt 55 mph  the car shutters and every road bump is felt  Long trips are an exhausting experience Needless to say  this is the last Ford  my wife and I plan to buy  A Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla are much better uses of your car buying dollar  In addition  there have been numerous recalls on this lemon  I feel like I should make a standing appointment with the Ford mechanic  
Neg, I got the car from Sunnyvale Ford  In my opinion it seems to be a good place to buy a car but not a good place to service it  If you want to service your car in the San Jose area  better go to Frontier Ford in Santa Clara I got the ZTS Sedan which had every option possible except Advance Track and automatic transmission  One reason I picked ZTS over SE is that ZTS has standard 16  wheels with 205 50 tires I test drove Focus ZTS with an automatic and I must say that it felt very lame  It shifts up at very low revs  while the engine likes to be revved   Later I learned that the new automatic transmissions  as well as modern engines   learn  some program parameters during the first 30 50 miles  This might explain the lameness of the Focus with automatic  but that is just a guess The version with 5sp manual transmission is fun to drive  The engine revvs very smooth  The power is available from low 2000rpm to well over 5000rpm  It is easy to cruise at 45mph in 5th gear  But I can also rev it and have fun   The thing I really like about this car is that it feels very stable in curves  So far I have never felt that the car was loosing grip in a curve  and I have tried to push it a few times The breaks are also very good  and ABS helps when it rains And now the COMPLAINTS After two weeks  about 750 miles  I noticed a bulge on the hood near the right hinge  I took it back to the dealer  It took me a while to convince them that the bulge was something that had to be fixed and that it wasn t me that caused it  The convincing part was that I found a bent steel rod under the front seat  which turned out to be a support rod for the hood  It appears that some moron  at factory  dealership  closed the hood with the rod still supporting it It took them 4 days to fix the hood  as it had to be repainted  It looks like new  I only hope that the paint will last as long as the original   I got a rental car for the period that my car was being fixed  however they initially did not want to pay insurance on the rental car  Eventually I got a  100 voucher to compensate for the money I spent on rental car insurance The center arm rest seems to have been designed for cars with automatic transmission  It is in the way when lifted up  and one has to lift it up to use a hand brake comfortably In May  when the outside temperatures got higher I noticed that the dashboard started squeaking like mutilated squirrel  sounded like two pieces of styrofoam rubbed against each other  It took me 4 visit to the service department before they finally fixed it by replacing the instrument panel bezel  Before they decided to replace it  they tried spraying WD 40  or something like it  between the bezel and the dash and loosening the screws that hold it  this made the dash rattle  so that I had to take the car back to the service where they tightened the crews  which made the dash squeak again   Altogether  this was very annoying experience At about 5000 miles I started noticing a rattle coming from the rear of the car  It was noticeable  and sometimes pretty loud  when driving over 60mph  It was difficult to locate precisely  but it seemed to come from somewhere near rear right wheel I brought the car twice to the dealership to have this fixed  First time they thought that some exhaust hanger was missing  It was installed but the rattle continued  Some 3000 miles later I brought the car again with the same problem  This time I went for a test ride with a mechanic  He could verify the rattle  He said that it was  a tough one  but did not do anything about it apart from adjusting rear right door which was a bit misaligned  Basically  he told me to see if this helps  and if not then to come again   I am sick of coming again and again to the dealership Fortunately  someone at www focaljet com forum gave me a hint to look at the aerodynamic deflectors placed in front of rear wheels and suspension  It took one look at it to figure out that they were the source of the noise  I wrapped some duct tape around them and the rattle stopped What it shows  is that the Sunnyvale Ford mechanics do not really know the cars they work on   In Summer I noticed that  on hot days the engine has much less power  especially between 2000rpm and 3000rpm  In part  this must be caused by airconditioning taking power from the engine  However  the power loss is there also with AC off I read some discussions at internet Ford Focus forums  and it seems that the power loss in higher temperatures is partly caused by bad design of the EGR  exhaust gas recirculation  system  It seems that the EGR valve opens too fast and at the wrong time  robbing the engine of power when it needs it most  i e  while accelerating Pity  because with the hesitation between 2000 and 3000rpm the car does not feel zippy anymore and is not such fun to drive  So in Summer the car is fun to drive only in the mornings when the air and engine are cool At 16900 miles the battery light came on  This time I took the car to be fixed at Frontier Ford  I also requested them to make and program 2 spare keys  I lost one  do something about squeaking rear brakes  and check if TSB 01 16 3  technical service bulletin  applied to my car  it is supposed to fix the engine stumble hesitation by reprogramming engine computer Frontier Ford did a good job on my car  They replaced alternator  made and programmed two keys for  87  replaced rear brake shoes  reprogrammed engine computer  and washed the car I haven t driven the car much since then so I cannot tell yet if the stumble hesitation has been fixed So what are my conclusions Sometimes I like my Focus  e g  morning drives to work  and sometimes I wish I bought a different car  e g  drives on hot weekends when it feels  felt  weak   I still have to see if this problem has been fixed Would I buy another Focus  I don t think so  If I were to buy a similar sized car now  I would probably go for a WV Golf or Jetta Would I buy another Ford  I do not know  I think Ford has some potentially good cars  They have good ideas  but they fail in implementation I do have another Ford  an Escape  but I think that its build quality isn t great either I think I will try another car brand  when time comes to replace my current Fords  
Neg, Our 20 year old son purchased a Ford Focus a few months ago  Paying  12 995 for this car  we didn t expect luxury  but we did expect good quality  So far that s not what we ve found Shortly after purchasing it  he received notification of two recalls  which of course the dealer promptly took care of  From there  however  it s been lots of little things things that will undoubtedly eventually nickel and dime him to death  if the car even retains that kind of value The Focus feels like it s made of tin and plastic  Leaning on the hood or trunk will sometimes cause buckling  The bumpers are constantly detaching from the vehicle and the front side panels are  too  My son has finally resorted to a type of automotive  super glue  to fasten these parts back onto his car  He has tired of the weekly trips to the dealership The Focus is an attractive car at an attractive price  and this is sadly part of the reason young buyers are flocking to Ford dealers to buy them  They are sporty and economical  Fifteen dollars a week is all my son has ever spent on gas  and some weeks have seen quite a few miles Yet I remain concerned about the safety of this vehicle  as it doesn t appear to be solidly built and besides  who wants to trust a vehicle to protect its occupants if the outside parts keep falling off Aside from these complaints  my son does insist that his Focus runs like a dream  It has good pick up and is easy to handle  His is a standard My son s Focus came with cloth interior and a great stereo system  The CD player was included I guess if one is looking for a cheap set of brand new wheels  the Focus is enticing  However because so many young people are purchasing it  due to its affordability  I do have deep concerns regarding safety  
Neg, I was recently married  My husband and I decided we should buy a car  After much consideration and various test drives  we decided against the Ford Ranger and went with the 2001 Ford Focus  my theory being  where would we put the kids in a truck  This was my first mistake The car was awesome  We had a great time bombing around in our brand new car and decided to take it on a road trip when I drove him back to California where he works  I was to stay in California for a few weeks then return back to Toronto While down here  I was in an accident  I was rear ended by some punk kid  The damage was minimal to my untrained eye so I figured that it would be in the shop for a couple of weeks and then I would have my car back  This was six weeks ago  What is the deal you ask  Well let me tell you Ford puts out manuals of car parts  Little pictures with all the parts drawn neatly in a little square  and then a list of all the parts you would need to fix the car  Unfortuantely  someone  somewhere was slacking on the job or was too high to realise what he was drawing and perhaps turned to drawing little doodles instead of the parts  The result of this is the one part stopping my car from being on the road does not exist  It is not on the parts list  nor in the diagram of little pictures  So what does this mean for me  This means endless hours on the phone to my insurance company  Ford Customer Service  who  by the way  assure me that there will be an internal investigation  the Body Shop who is fixing my car  who are actually a Ford Dealership Body Shop  and my parents  trying to figure out a way to get my vehicle and get me home  Rental bills so I do not have to be stuck sitting here with no car  are piling up and although my insurance company is reimbursing me  that does nothing for me now Apparently this is not the only problem they have had  Seatbelts  transmissions  seats  panels etc have all taken between 2 weeks and 6 months to arrive at various body shops in North America  leaving you  the proud Ford automobile owner  stranded This has been one of the worst experiences of my life and I dread even thinking about what would happen if I were to be in another car accident with this vehicle  
Neg, When my 2001 Explorer Sport s transmission died  see my review  I ended up with a Ford Focus 2 door as a rental for the week Coming from a big and tall SUV to a small  city commuter  I was worried about the Focus being under powered but I was pleasantly surprised at the pep   even with an automatic transmission Engine Peppy for city driving   even with auto transmission  Highway driving is also smooth Interior Extremely cool dash design  Though the dash is ergonomically correct  some cost cutting is noticeable with the lack of warning lights and lights on buzzers  Front seats were firm and supportive  Rear seating   even in the 2 door   was fine for 2 smaller adults  Rear hatch stores a big trunk space Over time  however  the seat fabric has begun to wear  The Seatbelts anchor s plastic guards are cracking and the cheapie no tach dash is pretty uninformative Quality  revised Though the car started off very tight  fit and finish seemed to deteriorate after a year Overall Good design that seems to have suffered major Quality Control problems  Commuter car in the 2 door format  Much more stylish than a Civic  I did feel as if I was sitting very low to the ground   but then again  I was coming off an Explorer  The 4 door models lack the daring design of the 2 door and the station wagons are even more conservative  
Neg, It is a 92  got it used about a year after it came out so it was basically as close to factory condition as you r going to get without actually being there  so let me talk about ours  the cigerette lighter in the back doesnt work is our only major problem  but we don t need that anyway  So we ve been in several accidents with it  some in which would be classified as  quot totaled quot  to the cost  even though it wasn t all that bad anyway  so we got them all fixed  and it still runs pretty good  sometimes the heat doesn t work but besides that there little or no problems br br  
Neg, I bought my Aerostar 1992 from a friend about a year ago  with over 110 000 miles  for a 1500 bucks  He sold this van because he disliked the van Comparing to toady s new minivans  the Aerostar is far from the good minivans  Makes big noise at driving  Steering wheel makes also big noise at each turn  Rides very bumpy  It s not comfortable to drive long trips  Toady s new cars   minivans are very smooth  The Aerostar is not  Braking is also poor  All passengers are feeling that I m braking now  If you don t wear seat belts  you almost fall down when braking  When I stop  at a traffic light  etc  the van shudders and shivers Also the power windows doesn t work fine  I have to push it down with my hands  to  HELP  the power  The sliding door is not closed unless you close it with full power  and you hear a THUNDER noise  and the whole van shudders  So every time you have to try about 3 4 times to close it  I also hate the design of the Aerostar  Also had a lot of problems w  the Air conditioning  The stereo system sounds very bad I also dislike that you have to climb in into the van  Like a big SUV  The new minivans today  excluding Chevy Astro  has a low step in height  which is great On the other hand  it has a very strong engine  It s a truck like van  with the powerful and noisy engine  And   it s better than nothing  It s my first vehicle  so I m happy with it  until I ll have money for a better one  I need a minivan for the room of it  I ve once rented a Ford Windstar 2000  and another time the Pontiac Montana 2001  and they re unbelievable  Very smooth  good braking  comfortable seating  and nice panels  with a lot of features  So when I got back to my Aerostar I wasn t happy  No features  no nothing  Just a simple  HEAVY DUTY  minivan Sorry for my English  
Neg, All in all the van has proven to be dependable  Lots of little annoying things went wrong  The most serious was that the large sliding door quit opening  I have not had that fixed yet  Tape player quit working along with the remote radio panel  Bought the van in 96 and all these quit in 98  Power mirrors don t work now  AC fan went out last year  All these except for the large sliding door seem small  Front end hard to keep inline  but Arkansas roads seem to help that  Motor is still strong after 121 000 miles and mechanically I would not be scared to drive this van cross country  It would take alot to fix all the little things wrong to make this a real nice van again  Plan on trading soon No problem with motor or drivetrain  Put starter on last year br br  
Neg, My father in law bought this car new in Nov  1993  It has the 3 8l v6  I don t have to tell you about the 3 8l Ford V6 From the beginning he had problems with the electrical system  Ford repaired the tail light assembly  The tachometer went out at 1 year  Needed brakes at 2 years   14 000 miles  Master cylinder and calipers at 20 000 miles   3 years  My wife inherited it in 1996  At that time we had a 1994 t bird that I loved  It had the V8 motor and was a blast to drive  Very reliable  Any way  at 35 000 miles the brakes went out again  One winter morning the temperature dropped to  5 degrees  When my wife started the car the left turn signal came on all by itself  the right side window kept going up and down all by itself  the horn started blowing and the head lights started flashing between high and low beam and then off  This car has a mind of it s own  At 50 000 miles I was in a parking lot and started to back out and brushed up against a guard rail and the whole front bumper assembly came off  Cost   1500 00  Both door panels are falling apart  The drive side door hinges broke and had to be replaced  Now the hinges on the passenger side need replacing  At 63 000 miles it had a blown head gasket  Cost   2500 00  The car has 64 000 miles on it now and last night my wife pulled out into traffic and the car stalled  She almost had a wreck  Some wonderful people pushed it off the road for her and that is where it is now  Going to have it towed to a junk yard today and buy a Dodge Intrepid DO NOT BUY THIS CAR UNLESS YOU ARE A VERY RICH PERSON THAT WANTS TO THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY br br  
Neg, I loved this car until everything started going wrong with it  It has been in the shop numerous times just for recalls  how safe can that be  Then it has been in the shop for repairs and they can never seem to find the problem Now for the good things  The interior is very roomy and comfortable  Ours is loaded with power everything which is great  Power windows are the best when you are alone in the car and need that passenger window down  same with power door locks  The car gets decent gas mileage on the highway but really sucks it down in the daily driving around town  All in all we are pleased with it but are ready to pay it off and start with something else br br  
Neg, This car has been a nightmare  It is currently sitting in front of my house with a tarp over it because the windows no longer work  or the locks  or the a c  or the headlights  Before you jump to conclusions about how i have abused the car  let me give you the cars history 1993  My dad bought a beautiful black t bird lx with red interior  Within a week of having the car the back tail light almost caught fire and has been broken since  The car was purchased in late november 1994  no problems  my dad barely puts any miles on the car 1995  babied as usual  car has always been washed at least once a week  and waxed roughly once every two months The car did require lower ball joints and brakes this year though  and an alternator  car still does not have 30k on it 1996  Not a bad year for the car  the door handle on the passenger side breaks loose this year though car still does not have 30k on it 1997 Car requires brakes again At 39 thousand miles the transmission goes out  the a c compressor also begins to whine a bit lower ball joints again this year the speedometer breaks also 1998  I purchase the car from my dad in february  I gut the stereo system install alarm  and new rims  The car begins to float all over the road  At 45k it needs tie rods  It also needs brakes again  and a sensor goes out and the car leaves me stranded  The door hinges on the drivers side actually brake in august of this year  Late that year the transmission has to be taken back 1999 This was a big year for the car  It took ford 1000 dollars worth of work to find the sensor that made the car shut off for no reason  Car once shut off while i tried to cross the street and i almost got hit by all three lanes of cars  the headlights die now both sides of the doors have broken loose  cant run the a c or the car will overheat  Another alternator  and the entire ignition need to be replaced  and a battery and more brakes and the car is almost impossible to keep in one lane while on the interstate  In late december the a c dies car has 68 thousand miles on it now 2000  In january the headlights die for the second time and i have to replace the blinker switch has headlight controls in it also In march the locks begin to stick on the doors and the front end has a terrible sound coming from it  in april i finally replace the rack and pinion lower ball joints and a few bushings for 862 dollars still no a c in car  3 days later it looks like it is going to rain for the first time in months  i go to roll up the windows  and neither of them work  the power locks no longer work  nor does the a c  In a rainstorm with a trashbag over the windows i sit in the car at a friends house  and replace the window switches  now one window works and still no locks  While driving the car home the headlights died for the final time and so did the radio final mileage  77 833 Cosmetically the car has no dents or scratches  and still shines like new The interior is spotless no rips in the leather  no stains  nothing  from reading the posts on this site  its half and half on the reliability  but overall these cars are a nightmare  I would not recommend buying a t bird to my worst enemy br br  
Neg, So there are a ton of reviews about this car saying it is the greatest  Well it is  But I m still here to burst your bubble  It has problems  I personally own one  it s a  93 Ford Thunderbird LX with 80 000 miles on it  I love it but it doesn t always seem to love me back  Recently it has been having problems with the thermostat on the engine  You may say   quot No biggie  it s only a  10 part that can be easily replaced quot  and you d be correct  It is  However it keeps on breaking  The problem is not the thermostat  because I have tried different brands  many with lifetime warranties  and they still keep on breaking  Still no biggie but it regulates your engine s temp  and you don t want it over heating  Also  every once in a while the spark plugs will miss a step  causing the car to shake  Many say that the engine put in these cars is the worst one Ford makes  But I m not sure about that  Anyway  have fun with any car you choose br br  
Neg, My husband owns a 1993 Ford Thunderbird and it has caused us nothing but a headache and has put a whole in our bank account  At 38 000 miles he had a problem with the electrical system  At 40 000 miles he had to have all of the brakes and drums and etc  replaced in which was a cost of 1 000 00 at 42 000 miles the head gaskets blew the cost to repair this was 2 500 00  Now there is 52 000 miles and two of the motor mounts need to be replaced  the driver side door won t stop chiming when you have the lights on  The molding on the drivers side is coming off  I know my husband isn t to blame for these problems because he babies his cars and he is a very excellent driver  This car does have excellent pickup  handles uphill with ease  When driving in rain or snow the rear end tends to sway while making turns  The interior is very spacious  seats five with enough extra space to seat six  even if all the passengers were six feet tall  The trunk space is very spacious The long roomy look this car has is very appealing but once you own one it s not worth it s looks br br  
Neg, Everyone has heard of all these great new innovations that are intended to make our everyday lives more convenient you know  disposable diapers  disposable cameras  disposable contact lenses  and I believe this was Ford s idea of a disposable car  I was so in love with my electric blue 95  Ford Probe SE  Sport Edition  in the beginning  As I drove it off the lot with its 37 miles on it I lovingly named it Poindexter and vowed to wash it on a bi weekly basis  It was truly cherished a car among cars mine  I loved the way it handled  the sleek body style  the gas mileage  the way men turned their heads as I drove past  but all that came to an end  except the head turning   tee hee  within the first year  It all began when the vanity mirror fell off the passenger side sun visor  It may sound small  but you would be amazed how many people use that thing  Shortly after the trunk on the hatchback decided to wimp out and tried to decappatate you at the first moment you weren t looking  The windows rattled every time you drove and my cigarette lighter fizzled out on me  Good thing it was all under warranty  Right  Well  some of it Ford took responsibility for and fixed as well as expected I suppose  Everything else was cosmetic and wasn t included in the warranty  Great  Although all women know that cosmetics are important  I ve never considered myself stuck up enough to really care about trivial things  It got me to school  to work  to parties  and those were what mattered  until suddenly it didn t  About 4 months before the warranty was up  the battery gauge on the dash would go from the dead center to  quot oh no  absolutely no juice quot  every time I would come to a stop  Driving a car without stopping is actually kind of difficult  so back to the shop  quot Dex quot  went  Two weeks later they deciphered it was nothing more than the battery and I was free to pay the  175 that was not covered by the warranty  Yee Haw Well  to make a long story short  my warranty expired and suddenly they figured out exactly why my car was acting funny  It needed a new set of belts  Then when that didn t fix it  it needed a new altenator  then a distributor cap  then spark plugs and eventually an idle speed motor  The brakes have been done 3 times  the last time costing me  1200 because I needed shocks  calipers  rotors  and God knows what else  I ve needed 4 new rims  3 sets of tires  2 new antenna motors   and a partridge in a pear tree  and have had to deal with the fact that the material is dangling off the ceiling of my car and my seatbelts won t go back in their slots  I have sunk the value of my car into my car in the past year alone  Now  I am a girl  and guys seem to always think I was ripped off  but what do you do when you re single and your car is sitting in a shop with the wheels off   No  crying didn t help  I tried that  Reliability is definitely not it s strong suit  Well  I can finally write this opinion with a clear conscience  because as of yesterday I am a Chevy owner  I finally got my 00  Silverado  extra cab  step side and will not have to worry about dealing with Ford again  I have named it Maverick  in hopes that a tougher name might make for a tougher vehicle    It is so nice to have a vanity mirror again     
Neg, I bought my 1995 Ford Probe SE because of the sporty look  the price  and the great things I d heard about Ford cars  My one and only mistake was thinking a car seat would fit in the back WRONG  Well  not totally wrong it WILL fit  but not comfortably  I ve had great luck with my Probe so far  and I DO love it  It s gone over 15 000 miles with no problems  It s only been in the shop 4 times  and only for oil changes and new tires  It gets great gas mileage  which IS good for a family  but like I said there s just not enough room  My Probe has more than adequate power  rides great and is great to look at too   This would be a great car for a single guy or girl  but if a family car is what your looking for pass this one by  The seats aren t the easiest thing to clean   hard to get in the grooves  should Junior spill some ice cream  or drop his lollipop  And with such a sharp look  who wants ice cream and lollipop all over the seats anyway  Though reasonably priced  mine was around  3500  used  you can get a much better deal on a more  quot family quot  type vehicle     
Neg, All I can say about this car is  yuck  I can t wait to get rid of it  Everything rattles  squeaks  and knocks  Paint is peeling off of the side view mirrors and the hatcback hydraulics are shot  The passenger room is close to non existent my fiancee is 5 5  120lbs and she complains about space  The interior materials are cheap plastic and crack very easily  The controls are inconvenient and hard to reach  The back seat is a joke  The shift action is  squishy  and non responsive  The engine sounds like it is going to blow at 3200 RPM s and the acceleration is obscenely non existent  It has this mysterious stalling problem at times and the CEL light pops on and off at random times  It handles  OK  I have previously owned an Integra GSR  and a Nissan Maxima  both of which I was sad to see go  especially after owning this pile  I have even owned a 1990 Subaru Loyale that I liked better than this car and I had to change the alternator in the Subaru 3 times and the tranny once  This is the worst car that we have ever owned  Don t buy  
Neg, I bought a 1995 Probe in 1998  with its sweet lines and smooth ride  a black beauty with the spoiler  the kind of car all your friends get jealous over  But when it was less than a month after I bought it  that it went into the shop to stay from March UNTIL September  my friends were less than jealous  Going from one mechanic to another  with Ford people running tests on it  After rebuilding the transmission for about  1800  I got it back in September or so  I got to drive it until the end of February  and back to the shop again  Both times the O D light had come on flashing  and over 60 MPH  the car would jerk forward  but the transaxle  as the manual suggests  was not the problem  Once again the transmission was worked on from February March UNTIL almost June  When I went to pick it up  I got about 10 miles away from the shop  and it was running hot back to the shop for the Water pump to get fixed  THEN  after 2 months  I once again went to pick it up again  and the engine was revving on its own  So now it sits at the Ford dealership automotive department  with a new they discovered after replacing the timing belt  that that was not the cause of the trouble 525 timing belt  with a suggestion that it might be the throttle body  for another  825 or so  If anyone has web links to other troubled probes HELP br br  
Neg,  Sick of politics  After this election year  who wouldn t be  I mean  all those amusing bumbles and hyperbolic exaggerations  luckily  things have subsided for now  until 4 years from now  that is  But do exaggerations exist elsewhere to fill the void  Let s try one   the new Ford Escape has just set the new standard for mini SUV s  Any response to that  Will the media clamor to call me a liar  I think not  Why  Because the Escape  has  raised the bar on this class  and other car manufacturers had better fall in line  quick  Still  there s a caveat  and it s no less important to consider before going out and buying this vehicle b The mini SUV class offers several choices  yet still offers you little  On one hand  you have the small  car based  underpowered toys like the Honda CR V and Toyota RAV4  although it s been redesigned  and on the other side  you have a relative behemoth  the Nissan Xterra  In my opinion  the only compromise in this class was the Suzuki Grand Vitara  until now Many reviews of the Escape on this site describing test drives came out when the vehicle just came out  This made little sense to me because a glitch in the vehicle s steering forced dealers not to allow the car for test driving purposes  in my city  at least  At any rate  when I finally received the phone call that I could  I was there at a moment s notice  Here are my impressions b EXTERIOR  8  As you may or may not know  Mazda had a pretty large role in creating the design for this vehicle  The Mazda version is sold as the Tribute  and has a few cosmetic and option differences with the Escape  but essentially the two cars are identical  The design is a unibody construction  which automatically lands this vehicle as more of a  road  cruiser than  off road  warrior  Still  the vast majority of drivers out there are going for image and or carrying capacity  so not too many will complain about that The Escape is what Ford needed to enter the small SUV fray  It s the smallest SUV in its model line  and is just a little shorter than a Honda CR V  It sits on 16  Firestone Wilderness HT tires  no cause for alarm here  and has a ground clearance of almost eight inches  which make it a decent beach cruiser or very  lite  off roader The rear tire isn t mounted on the back like other sport utes in its class which saves you tons of money in the event of a rear collision Do I like how it looks  Does it matter  The decision is yours  of course  I have seen the Escape photographed with more aggressive rims  and liked that look much more  If I had two words to describe how it looks  I d say  actively pedestrian  I prefer the Mazda Tribute s exterior to this one  it has more of an elegant flair to it that I find appealing b INTERIOR  7  Okay  let s hit on the  pros  here  the dash is a user friendly design  with everything readable and within reach  The white faced gauges  XLT model  are quite nice as well  What s more  you can fit up to 63 cubic feet of cargo with the rear seats folded down  Not bad at all for this class  Bikes and camping gear should fit comfortably  that  is  what you re considering this vehicle for  right  I was also quite impressed with the interior room provided for front and rear passengers  In fact  I d say that no other SUV in this class really sizes up well with the Escape in this category  save for the Honda CR V  There are plenty of very useable cubbies and pockets for you to store your stuff  too  including two nicely sized cup holders that don t get in the way of things  The air conditioner works fine  although the cooler weather here didn t give it a great bench test  The in dash CD sound system is decent  at best  an available MACH system would definitely be on my list of must haves The  cons  Oh  there s the minor things  the column shifter felt strange and ambiguous  kind of like one found on an 80 s Buick station wagon  if that makes any sense  I didn t find the seats particularly comfortable  although the material did seem like it could stand up to some abuse  Perhaps the available leather option would help things out a bit  no models on the lot had the option  so I couldn t try it  But  those are minor things after all  There s  major  problems too  though   The most glaring fault of the interior is  quality    Even if we were to ignore the fact that hard plastic abounds in this SUV  I guess it s to be expected  it was very hard for me to ignore the fact that the bottom door panels were coming off and I could see the metal underneath  Equally hard to ignore was the tinny  clang  sound the doors made when I shut them  a far cry from the Suzuki Grand Vitara s  thud  A small rattle seemed to be coming from the front of the dash on the passenger side when the road got a little bumpy   ENGINE  10  When I reviewed the Suzuki Grand Vitara  I said it had an engine that was the perfect size for its class  Well  I was wrong  The 3 0 Duratec V6 that is available on the Escape certainly levels the playing field  I have yet to see an SUV in this class that has as much off the line grunt as this one does  Like a few of the reviewers here  I agree that power does start to weaken as you hit highway speeds  but I still would call this vehicle a very competent highway passer  The Escape s base engine is the one found in the Focus  2 0L 130 hp Zetec four  I didn t try it  but would strongly recommend the V6 option  Ford predicts the V6 model will outsell it s four cylinder model  The 200 hp Duratec V6 is taken from the Ford Taurus  in fact  the larger of two V6 engines offered in that car  The Mazda Tribute also has this engine available  The automatic transmission makes sophisticated shifts  and hesitates only a little when the pedal is floored b RIDE  7  For an SUV  Not bad at all  Sure  there s more road and wind noise than I d like  The engine also makes itself known all too often  perhaps some more insulation would help  Still  there s other aspects that should be praised  On the highway  the suspension makes this SUV a nice cruiser  Bumps are muffled very well  and there is very little annoying rebound on nastier irregularities   HANDLING  8  Out of the mini SUV s that I ve driven  the Escape is certainly one of the best compromises of ride and handling  No  I wouldn t call it cat like  but easily  car  like  There is very little body lean during everyday driving  I took a turnaround curve at a speed that I thought was too fast initially until I realized that the Escape was holding up admirably  Braking is very impressive  once again car like  In fact  further research indicated that the Escape stops  better  than some cars   Car and Driver  made the Escape stop in only 171 feet from 70 mph   0 mph  which is the best they said they had seen in a production SUV  Wow The Escape is primarily front wheel drive  although it does send power to the rear wheels if it detects any slippage  Just my luck  it was raining the day of my drive  and although the Control Trac II AWD system probably engaged during the course of the day  I never noticed it  There is  by the way  a 4WD switch for full time 4WD  which I did use later  Not surprisingly  there is no low range setting for serious off road treks b SAFETY  7  The Escape is equipped with your usual features like airbags and ABS  XLT and upward  I definitely would chalk some points up on the Escape s behalf as far as braking is concerned As for offset crash tests  the Escape didn t fare too well  scoring  marginal   one step above  poor   rankings are as follows  poor  marginal  acceptable  good  In other crash tests performed by the NHTSA  the Escape did better Front driver  five stars Front passenger  four stars Front side impact  five stars Rear side impact  five stars Rollover rating  three stars b RELIABILITY  5  Ahh  here s the caveat I alluded to in the beginning  you thought I had forgot  didn t you  I have always  always been wary of an introductory model car  and I urge you to consider that yourself  In fact  the Escape Tribute was scheduled to arrive sooner to showrooms  but quality concerns delayed things somewhat  I have already read of a few recalls on Edmund com s Town Hall  where the discussion topic is called  Mazda Tribute Ford Escape Problems  The few quality glitches that I picked up on during my drive  the rattles  the paneling coming off  didn t help things too much  either  Would I  dis courage you from buying it now  Yes  Would I  en courage you to wait a little while to test the waters first  Yes  Obviously  I m probably going to get a few nasty comments from happy owners  and that s all fine and dandy  I m happy for you that after 4 days of ownership nothing has gone wrong  But what happens when you hit 20 000 miles  Or 40 000 miles  I ve been studying cars for a long time  and  be careful  is all I have to say b VALUE  9  When it comes to dollars and cents  the Escape makes plenty of sense  I made a rhyme  happens all the time  can I borrow a dime  The V6 XLT I had included all the features I would require  minus the MACH stereo  These included the V6 engine  ABS  cruise control  an in dash CD player  air conditioning  remote keyless entry  power everything  and fog lamps  All for a price of around  22 000  I feel this is a very appealing value quotient that is being offered here  especially considering the amount of power that the V6 engine provides b THE VERDICT  WHY MUST I ALWAYS BE THE ONE WHO S NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT b This vehicle has a lot going for it  The only serious  and it is important  glitch is the concern for quality  I will watch how the Escape performs as the months pass  If and when I am proven wrong  I will change my tune faster than Al Gore changes his personality or George W  Bush can say  subliminal  For now  however  the  caveat  stands as pretty stong opposition to the  new SUV standard  that I spoke of  Once Ford addresses these issues however  and they will  other small SUV manufacturers had better adjust  or the electorate will leave  em without votes b AVERAGE SCORE  7 63 out of 10  b VARA S PERSONAL RATING  until reliability reports improve  7 0 out of 10  
Neg, Having recently suffered through a disastrous experience with a 2001 Ford Explorer Sport  I ended up in an Escape XLT which I thought would ultimately be a better choice The Escape is a thoroughly modern SUV   well proportioned with a large interior  it matches or betters the Explorer in comfort in almost every area  The exterior design is efficient looking though not as stylish as the Toyota Rav4  In the forest green  I ve had people mistake the Escape for the new Rover Freelander b The Interior b The leather seats are not as firm  contoured or supportive as the fabric seats in the Explorer Sport  The dashboard styling is disappointing generic  And whoever designed the automatic gear shifter arm should be shot because one can t see the defrost button  Power outlets are not designed for cell phones to be used and plugged in   they are too low  And if you use a speaker cell phone cradle  the hockey stick of a shifter will get in the way Interior space for 4 passengers is very good  fine for 5  In fact  if you compare the specs  the Escape interior is almost identical to the larger Explorer Ergonomics are good everywhere else   gauges are the currently trendy white with black markings  The dash seems to be made of a cheap  hard shell plastic as opposed to the cushioned dash of the Explorer  I also have a wonderful 6 CD sound system that reminds me of the Mach 460 system in the Mustang  Unfortunately  on a very hot day  the CD system mysteriously failed for the afternoon  And recently  the rear window wiper motor failed as well Also disappointing was that the Escape didn t have the same back lit switches as the Explorer has  Power windows alone should be back lit at night  The Explorer also had puddle lamps which were very handy b Engine b The V6 engine is smooth and torquey though not much better than the Explorer V6 for gas mileage in the city  Highway driving seems to yield better mileage than the Explorer  This is apparently a derivation of the V6 used in the Taurus b Dealer network b The first time I ve dealt with a Los Angeles area Ford dealer  I was mortified at the poor support in the area of post sales  After taking the Escape off the lot  I spent the first weekend documenting a few things that needed to be tightened  fixed or touched up  When i brought the vehicle back  you would have thought I had asked them for their livers  I tried a different dealer who surprised me by telling me to go back to the dealer I bought the car from  Hardly a unified Ford team b Recalls  With the number of recalls on the Escape  I ve received 3 so far  the dealer network should be helluvalot more supportive to make sure that these cars are 100  Given the Firestone debacle with the Explorer  the Escape should be job one  When you get a recall  the Ford dealers don t seem to see how inconvenient it is to take the car in in the morning  get a ride to work  get a ride back to the dealership b Driving b The Escape is a pleasure to drive in the city and on the highway  Great pick up  a commanding view of the road and yet environmentally friendly than the giant Expeditions or Excursions I see  Very easy to park  The seats could be more supportive   especially given what the car can do  With all the talk about SUV rollover  the Escape startles traffic light racers with its speed and handling capabilities  Surprisingly  the turning circle is bigger than the Explorer so U turns end up being 3 pts b Overall b This is the first rational sized SUV and it made me rethink what city dwellers really need in an SUV  The Escape is a nice compromise but in its first year  iffy quality  poor dealer support and poor gas mileage would make me choose something else or wait another year  The Escape should be a very good car by next year once all the bugs and recalls are ironed out  Don t forget   this is Mazda engineering  the Mazda twin is called the Tribute I m looking at the PT Cruiser for my next car  see my review  because its size and proportions fit my needs  the styling is a lot more interesting than the Escape  the interior is a lot more innovative  and the bad Ford dealer experiences finished off my 16 year loyalty to the make  
Neg, I was excited to get this vehicle as my next company lease vehicle as I thought the styling was good and offered utility in a better package Initial impressions were good as they were based on the engine performance and handling  Both are excellent and it went pretty well in serious snowfall as well As I lived with it  some interior CHEAP details started showing up  I know the plastic world  and Ford has used the cheapest plastics possible on this interior  My seat panels  next to the center console on the seat frame  are warped so badly that they will not stay in place  they pop off on one side  The seat belt cover on the b pillar is cracked and fell off  The interior light is horrible  Instruments are fine  but the dome light stinks  You have to turn it on with a switch ON the light  Ok  it is on but 90  of its light goes to the back and when you turn it off you have to set the switch in the middle  door  position  otherwise it is off regardless of opening doors etc  Trying doing that while driving and you think cell phones are dangerous  Try a simple dome light switch on the IP Ford  Also  hardly any of the door  heaven forbid the steering wheel  controls are lit  I believe the only switch lit is the drivers window  Also  why does the window lockout switch also lockout the driver from controlling these windows  CHEAP  Front seats need armrests  My XLS has a center console that is basically flat I think the XLT has a higher console that can be used for an armrest  Needs a rear cargo net too NOISE  The wind and tire noise  not to mention the squeaking rear hatch window combo  is horrible  You have to turn up the radio so much that once you stop  it is blaring  I try to use my heads free cell phone headset and can t because there is too much noise  Try turning on the recirculating AC you hear this big WAP from the HVAC system nice touch Warranty repairs  My steering started screaming and whining  so the dealer replaced the entire rack and 2 days later the tensioner idler pulley exploded losing all belt driven accessories  which includes the power steering  and required a roadside tow   I didnt know the problem at first and losing steering assist 2 days after they replaced the rack is a bit disconcerting  OH  and I complained about the squeaky rear hatch and the dealership s remedy was to remove the dealership license plate frame and charge my lease co   85  Which did nothing for the squeak of course Summary  Again  nice styling  nice engine  nice handling nothing else is nice  Noisey  quality problems  and obviously cheap on the interior  I never get better than 18mpg  3 0L V6  Coworkers get 24  with the same engine in their Taurus  That is alot of wind drag  
Neg, When I was in the market for a new SUV  the new 2001 models were just coming onto the market  There are few things I love about this vehicle  although the things I do like are major  The offroading abilities of this car are average  It has front and rear independent suspension  allowing for a nice ride on the street  but sometimes not the best choice for offroading  However  the car is short  The negative thing about this is that it limits your cargo room  which I must say  is extremely limited  The escape is almost undoubtedly safe  as Ford s reputation goes  Now for the driving  The Escape s steering is not quite that of a BMW  but its ok  The pickup  however  is above average  DO NOT BUY THE 4 CYLINDER ENGINE  It is unbelievably slow  and it is pitiful that Ford would even try to get people to buy it  The more fitting SUV for this size is the Mazda Tribute  the Escape s twin  I prefer the tighter suspension  and quasi nicer interior  Consider it over the Escape  In conclusion  the Escape is OK for a person on the market for the average in compact SUVs  and it is more of a car anyway br br  
Neg, I recently rented one for 5 days to go skiing up in Lake Tahoe  On the road  the car  you ll see why I call it a car  performs well  It has good power  reasonable handling and for an SUV  good gas mileage  The seats are not particularly comfortable  If there s a little snow on the road  it seems to do fine  I didn t need to chain up  My primary complaint is that this so called 4x4 performs poorly when it get s a little deeper  I got stuck  The 4x4 system doesn t make sense  I m in 6  of snow  a bit off to the side of the road  The wheels that have traction don t want to move  while the wheels that slip  continue to slip  It s as if the system only powers the wheels that have the least amount of grip  The system has an Auto 4x4 mode  Neither system worked  I could not discern a difference  Ok  that  coupled with the questionable reliability  I think that you get what you pay for I got pulled out by a Toyota 4Runner   My next vehicle  or perhaps a Pathfinder  I was also considering a Honda CR V  but I suspect many of these wannabe 4wd systems will eventually leave me out in the cold  Granted  I know real 4WD vehicles will also high center and get stuck  but my situation was not even close  
Neg, Well  my landscaping saga continues as I venture to get stonewall siding and this time I got to borrow a  2003 Ford Excursion  to get the siding  You would have thought I would have learned not to do this after my less than impressive trip with a GMC Yukon Denali I borrowed  But I figured another great review chance and I wanted to see if this vehicle is a great as many owners hype it up to be  One of my co workers is a mother of 3 older kids and their Explorer and king cab Dodge truck just wasn t enough space for the kids and crap they usually lug along  Before they bought an Excursion  we were talking one day about what their next vehicle would be when the lease runs out on the Dodge and how she wanted more space  I told her to consider the Honda Odyssey  Toyota Sienna or even a Kia Sedona because they a lot of room and seemed to fit her needs  She says   No way  I can t drive a minivan  I m not the minivan type  They re ugly  However  what they brought home was much uglier  I thought her views were a little uh off considering they don t tow anything and never go off road  but thought an Excursion would be better than a minivan  Well  it certainly costs more  Problem is  they re die hard Ford fans  i i  and there s not much in the minivan or car selection from them now  Matter of fact  it s predicted that by 2005  Ford will only sell trucks and SUVs  i okay  not really  but this wouldn t surprise me  I decided to check it out when borrowing the Excursion for another landscaping mission  hoping I would not come to the same conclusion as with the Denali  And that is that for these type of trips  picking it up yourself can be more time  work and money than simply paying to have it delivered  So  another half of a Saturday down the drain  but with a better insight on the Excursion  The Excursion was introduced in 2000 and sales have been suffering since  so much so that Ford had to cut production in half in 2001 b i Performance  Power and Handling   This model has the  6 8L V10 with 310 HP   but you can also get a  5 4L V8 with 255 HP or 7 3L V8 Diesel with 250 HP   For a V10  I was not impressed with the power  maybe I was expecting too much  It was able to move  but acceleration was minimal and not exciting  don t expect much when passing on the highway  this engine is designed to pull a lot of weight  but not fast  It can  tow up to 11 000 lbs b  with the V10  but despite the Dumbo like side view mirrors  this elephant would not fly  I think the major problem is it weighs in at about 7 200 lbs  by itself  not including passengers or cargo  using a lot of power to move itself  The Excursion has a  44 gallon gas tank and recommends a minimum of 87 octane fuel   I had to put 32 gallons into it before returning it  costing me  49 60  to fill it from empty to full would cost about  68 20 at current prices in my area  This angered me because the delivery service from the landscaping place would have been cheaper  not to mention less time consuming  Depending on the engine  the gas mileage ranges from  7 10 MPG to 11 15 MPG   Problem is the low gas mileage has earned this model a spot on  The Meanest Vehicles for the Environment  for 2002 list  which can be viewed at www greenercars com  It will most likely make the list again for 2003 and may not be good for the resale value  The Power Stroke Diesel V8 engine requires 1D or 2D diesel and achieves marginally better gas mileage than the other two options  many owners report around 17 MPG and a max of 24 MPG  Maneuverability is a big problem with the Excursion  for making U turns  I found it needed at least four lanes  It s also a challenge to park in smaller  single lane parking lots because of the large turning radius required  you will most likely be readjusting in reverse at least once  I would not recommend this for regular city driving With nothing in it  the ride was fairly smooth  not really noticing small bumps  However  larger bumps sent a sharp jolt through the Excursion and made the vehicle continued to sway afterwards  something I also noticed in the Denali  With the back end weighed down  I was noticing every bump in the road and feeling many clunks  making for a bumpy ride  I was a little disappointed by this  expecting something this size to handle smoother  There was also a significant amount of body roll on tighter turns  Shortly after getting in and taking off  I started to despise the visibility issues with the Excursion and found myself constantly leaning forward and twisting around to double check everything  getting a strange kink in my neck  It s hard to get used to the larger front end and how close it is to other objects  Looking through the review mirror  it s hard to see lower objects  The Excursion is about  6 4 to 6 7 ft  tall   depending on if it has 4WD or not and the added height makes seeing over traffic nice  like the Denali I drove  but I found lower visibility to be a problem making it hard to see lower objects  This model had the  optional reverse sensor  that beeps when you get too anything close while backing up like a house  Parking the Excursion was a hideous nightmare  I m sure many people already figured this  The Excursion is about  19 ft  long and about 6 7 ft  wide   the average parking spot is only 18 ft  long  some less  No matter how you park  it will always be sticking out in the back and I was struggling to get it in as much as possible without hitting the car in front of it  the visibility issues weren t helping  it took 3 tries and a small portion of my sanity  Also  it s tricky to park next to other vehicles close to its size with those side mirrors that stick out so far  It s important when parking it to make sure it s centered in the spot to reduce the risk of it getting hit by the door of the car next to it  I found it was always close to the lot lines making something like this easy to happen b i Interior Looks and Features   Overall interior space on the Excursion is close to the Honda Odyssey at  146 4 cubic feet  behind the first row   100 7 cubic feet  behind the 2nd and  48 cubic feet  behind the 3rd  The leather captains  chairs in the front were comfortable  but got really hot in the sun  The instrument cluster is nothing to get excited about  it s very plain and dated looking with white on black gauges  black plastic and a steering wheel that was a strange shade of brown  The controls were well laid out and easy to reach for the most part  but all in black plastic and a plain layout  Maybe that s the young  wild side of me talking  but I found the interior very plain and drab with lots of black buttons  know knobs  silver or wood accents  kind of generic looking  I did not like the all button climate control  it seemed awkward to use compared to the large knob based systems  I couldn t reach over and easily make adjustments while driving  The power lock and window switches were easy to reach and seemed well laid out  Power adjustable pedals for different sized drivers is an option this model had  This model had the optional DVD entertainment system for the 2nd and 3rd rows  but I didn t get a chance to play with it  Remote keyless entry is standard on all models The Excursion can hold up to 9 passengers if you get the 3 bench rows seating option  this one s body count was only at 8 with two captains chairs in the front and 2nd and 3rd rows being benches  It can be as low as even 7 with the 1st and 2nd captains chair option  The 3rd row seemed roomier than the Denali  but still lacked a little in leg room for my 6 ft  tall frame and my head was still close to the roof and could possibly hit on a big bump  Up front  there are four cup holders that would hold just about any size cup and they re easy to reach  There are two interior color options  gray and beige  this one had beige that looked nice and warm  I don t think I d like the gray too much in something this size  the interior would seem too barren  The 3rd row of seats is fairly easy to remove  just flip them forward and pull a bar at the rear to slide them back b i Exterior Looks and Features   The Excursion has the front of the Ford F 250 and up series  the front end of a work truck and it s not attractive  The front grille is larger and sticks up higher than the head lights  I think Ford got this design from Dodge shortly after the RAM series were redesigned with a similar grille  But  they did not improve it  the grille is big and blank looking with no crossbars  just the blue oval in the center  creating a lot of negative space on the front  The headlights are standard  no metallic effects or any hints of stylization  Also  the large side view mirrors stick out very far from the sides  making me think of Dumbo looking at the Excursion from the front end  The mirrors also made me nervous parking because of the extra width to the truck  From the side  the Excursion looks very boxy  it has no sexy lines or curves  just an enormous wall  Getting two tone paint helps this a little  but not much  The front side windows have a gap in the front that slopes down  maybe for better visibility but I did not find how this helped A sad thing about the one I borrowed  it had been keyed twice on the driver s side  The owners weren t very happy about it and they re still in the process of getting estimates to have it fixed  Fortunately  this happened before I borrowed it  I m not sure why it was keyed  but have some theories with the controversy around an SUV of this size  however I didn t think that was a problem in this area  Anyway  the exterior color of this one is Estate Green  only available to Eddie Bauer editions  I have to say it was not attractive  a light flat pea green that looks like it came from the 70 s  anyone that has ever had a baby throw up on them is probably very familiar with this color  I guess I was not the only one that thought this because while getting ready to back out in the parking lot of Home Depot  two guys walking behind it made puking sound affects  Other color options include aspen green  hunter green with yellow hints  black  mineral gray  flat silver  white  red  true blue  light navy  and wedgewood blue  lighter blue The ground clearance is 8 1 inches  but it seemed a lot higher to me while loading the back  maybe even higher than the Denali  making it harder to load heavy objects  I realize the back opens up in 3 parts because of the size  but I still hate it  To open the back  first the window has to be flipped up  then the lower tailgate is in two doors that swing out on either side  Again  making it less convenient to load things quick  You can just lift the glass to load objects  but the height almost forces you to heave them in over the tailgate    Safety   The Excursion comes with 2 front airbags and 3 point safety seat belts  no safe canopy system like the Expedition  but it does have side impact beams  Reading other reviews  it seems everyone mentions safety as being a pro for the Excursion  but I can t find safety ratings for the 2000  2001  2002 or the 2003 model  not on NHTSA or IIHS  The Excursion is based of the F 250 truck and I can t find crash test ratings for it either  Also  there s no rollover information on it  So I can t say weather this is a safe vehicle or not  the only thing I know this model has going for it is weight b i Parting Shots   Pricing on the Excursion ranges from   35 500 up to  49 900   I m young and don t have a family  so I don t need to worry about a lot of passengers  But  growing up in a large family  I can understand why having a bigger vehicle is nice  I remember we had a large Dodge van that only came out of the side yard for family trips and or towing the boat  my parents used their smaller cars for commuting to work and short trips  After having experience with a couple of large SUVs over the past weeks  I can understand why my parents did not want to drive the large van all the time  It s just not fun to be stuck driving something this size all the time  I felt that way about the Excursion  It s big  can tow and has space  but it was not relaxing or exhilarating to drive because parking was a nightmare  forget parallel parking  visibility issues were stressful and it needs at least four lanes to make a U turn  which isn t always available  adding to the stress  Get up and go power is just not there  even with the V10  making for a sluggish ride  Also  I can see where loading kids might not be as easy as a van or a minivan because of the added height and the extra work to get to the 3rd row of seats and interior space is only slightly better that a minivan  very slightly  However  the higher ground clearance can make this space less convenient to use  This is a utility vehicle with a lot of towing power  but pricey for something used for occasional uses and pricey to drive all the time  I would only recommend it for people towing all the time  like for maybe a horse business of some sort or landscaping business  Off roading is not a big strength of this model because of the size  long wheel base and weight  I believe the Kia Sorento ad pokes fun at this  I don t know how it would handle in snow  because we just don t see that in Florida  but from what I read  having 4WD or AWD is good  but having a heavy vehicle  like the Excursion  is not always good  Something to look into and consider before buying if you live in a snowy area  The reason I give this model such a low rating is because it has such a limited targeted audience  very expensive for a truck that may not be used on a regular basis  has terrible gas mileage  worse than many in it s class  except the diesel model  and is not fun to drive  If you need a truck for towing  I would recommend looking for a good deal on one used to have around when you need it  If you need convenient space  look into a minivan that has equal room and is easier to drive  cheaper and gets better gas mileage  If 4WD is your primary need  maybe for snowy weather  look into a smaller  more nimble SUV  truck or sport wagon  again  you ll save money and have more fun driving it  The Excursion tried to combine all these uses in a big  expensive package with mediocre  less efficient and less usable results  This is essentially an F 250 truck without the rugged bed and only major strengths are towing  towing and  uh  towing  Did I mention towing  But  keep in mind  many minivans and smaller SUVs can tow  usually between 3 000 to 4 500 lbs  enough to accommodate many boats and trailers  The Excursion seems to be targeted to the larger loads and more industrial business uses hence the narrow targeted audience  But hey  if you paint it yellow with black stripes down the side  maybe the county will help pay you to drive it  
Neg, We bought an  04 Eddie Bauer  hoping it would have the refinements to make owning a large SUV tolerable  Wrong  For a list price of  48 000  you re better off buying a fully tricked out Toyota Sequoia  and still have plenty of money left to take a family vacation  The Expedition interior materials and controls are of poor quality and feel cheap overall  including the  Special  Eddie Bauer leather and carpeting  The 2nd row captains chairs are narrow  cheap  and shallow  The 2nd row leg room is no better than that of our Acura MDX  Which is generous for a mid size  but not for a full size SUV  The storage in the cabin is limited with very narrow door pockets  no sunglass holder  nor a two tiered console storage system  And if you get an aftermarket rear entertainment system  they put the play unit in the console  which already houses the multi CD changer  which is out dated  requiring you to load into a multi cassette instead of directly into the dashboard unit  very hard to change CD s while on the move  taking up what little room you have to begin with  The vehicle is not outfitted to take on Satellite Radio either The ride is harsh  and not refined at all  The independent suspension does NOT make a difference on vehicle stability nor does it soften the ride  The handling is very heavy and the engine is very noisy when accelerating The navigation system is outdated  using multiple disks instead of one DVD for the whole country  the screen is tiny  and not letterbox  which is easier to read  The disks do not have the level of detail that you would expect with a multiple dvd system  In fact  the Acura Navi has more info on one dvd in letterbox format So why did we buy this vehicle  We needed space  plain and simple  On long road trips with our two boys and our dog  we wanted a substantial vehicle under our seats  The Escalade Extended was WAY too much money for not much value  and it s navi was outdated as well  The Navigator had less room and a poorly designed cabin  with the shift taking up needed room on the console  and no  loose  storage room  To get almost as much rear storage room in the Sequoia  you have to lift and remove their heavy  bulky third row seats  and then you are seatless when you get to your destination  The Expedition has a fold flat rear seat  which is comfortable for an adult  or two  or three  The Nissan Armada did not have the curb appeal  nor the interior space of the Expedition  and the large engine and drive train are in untested waters for Nissan  We ll wait for the Infinity version of that one  So that leaves the Yukon Denali XL  which was nearly as costly as the Cadillac  and the Suburban  which is  I m sorry to say  just a cheap Chevy We wish that Acura would make a bigger granddaddy to the MDX  which we feel is the best value in an SUV on the market  
Neg,  Introduction  You d never believe it  I d never believe it  I decided to stop by the Ford dealer to take a look at this POS F 150 and compare it to the 454SS  The sales guy walks up and starts talking about how great a truck it is  Not wanting to damage my chances  I agreed with him  Then the unimaginable happened  He says   quot So  you wanna drive it quot I really had no reason to  but why not  This offer was crazy because I m an 18 year old kid  driving a Blazer with a brand new paint job that could maybe sell for  5 000 tops  the Lightening was sticker priced at over  32 000 b The drive  I didn t treat this truck like I should have for this article No all out acceleration  no tire spinning  but to tell the truth  she surprised me  The entire time I was driving the truck  it kept occurring to me that it was as fast as it was going to get I took her around the city a little bit  then a short sprint on the highway  I wouldn t buy one even if I had the cash b Pros  This thing is faster than the Ford Mustang Cobra  It ll run 0 60 in 5 9 seconds and the 1 4 mile in 13 6 right off the lot  It really helps that she has a big Vortec Blower under the hood It was a lot more comfortable than I was expecting  The other F 150 I have experience in was very uncomfortable  this one I felt like I could spend the whole day in and be fine  The truck I drove had a bench seat  I think you can also get sport bucket seats  This is one up on the 454SS If you use it to tow just not a lot  the exhaust is in front of the tire  so you won t get carbon all over your trailer The CD player was pretty nice  I brought along a Bon Jovi song to test it out  since I ve heard good things about it  I wasn t disappointed  the bass was good for stock and the four speakers filled the interior nicely That s all folks  I can t think of a single other pro b Neutral  The ride was better than in the other F 150 I ve driven  but still not as soft as a 454SS One thing that is nice in the Lightening that is unneeded  that should be in the 454SS is a tachometer b Cons  First of all  the obvious opinion  I think this truck is uglier than sin  Its too big to be as low as it is  It looks clumsy  The 454SS is a much better looking truck  even the generation one Lightenings are better looking You ll never get it to compete on the road tracks against the Cobra  at least not in a reasonable price range The Special Vehicle Team  SVT  did a wonderful job pulling every last pony pound of torque out of the 5 4 liter V8  Your problem is that you ll have a heck of a time getting the truck going faster than 13 6   100 mph in the quarter mile  My recommendations are underdrive pullies and new heads  Or just stick a real engine in there  After talking to an owner  the only thing he was able to do to his was cosmetic junk The automatic transmission is ridiculous  A sports car or truck has to have a manual transmission option  Otherwise it is slow How about some gas mileage here  Sure  its not as bad as her arch rival  the 454SS  but it is awfully low at 14 miles per gallon  Especially with that little engine One large selling point for the 454SS was that it will easily tow 10 000 lbs  With the Lightening  you ll be able to tow half that  Which is less than the S 10 Extreme with 3 04 smallest  rear end b Overall  I d take a 454SS anyday  You can get the Chevy for way less  and for a little bit of money  you can really get that big block moving The Lightening is pretty much torqued on to death and you won t get too much more speed out of it You ll have a little more trouble finding a 454SS  but price difference and likeability will be much greater If you just want to go fast and don t care if it s a truck  get a Camaro SS or Cobra Mustang  Same price  better handling  better gas mileage  more aftermarket If you re really interested in sport trucks  I have written an article on the 454SS My recommendation  avoid the Lightening br br  
Neg, For years I had heard favorable things about the Ford Taurus  So I took advantage of the opportunity to replace my  84 Reliant wagon with a 1995 Taurus wagon about six months ago  The car has been reliable  handles well  for me  I m no cowboy on the road though  and I really like the lockable compartment built into the floor of the rear cargo area  But the Taurus has lots of annoying design shortcomings  that aggravate me daily For starters  after locking the car with the electric door locks  all you need do to open the car door is use the handle   no need to actually unlock the door  This  feature  places children or others  such as my aged mother  in peril  since you need not actually unlock a door in order to open it  There may be childproof locks for the rear doors  I haven t checked that out  since I don t transport young children  It also means after I exit the car from the driver s side  if I want to access another car door to remove something  I have to remember to unlock ALL the doors  before exiting the car  The radio sound is of decent quality  but I hate radios with all pushbuttons  since you actually have to take your eyes off the road in order to turn the radio on or change bands  A raised circular power volume knob would increase operability for this radio immensely  Once the radio is on  there is a convenient button located near the steering wheel that allows you to scan previously programmed channels in the current frequency band  either AM  FM1 or FM2  You can also adjust the radio volume using another button near the steering wheel  The radio also seems to be much more susceptible to outside electrical interference than the radios in any of my other cars  Buick  Olds and Chevy  forcing me to actually turn the radio off sometimes on my way to work  Road noise also competes with the radio much more so than in my other cars I have a power seat with the car  This feature is great to have  but once again  Ford engineers have screwed it up  There is very little space between the left side of the seat near the floor and the car door  Located in that small space are the power seat controls  the rear gate release and the gas tank cover release  Needless to say  everytime I reach for the gas tank cover release  I hit the power seat buttons  moving the seat in some unpredictable way  To avoid this  I always open the car door  just to release the gas cap cover  The release doesn t actually pop the cover  by the way  It only releases it  Thus gas station attendants will stand there  yelling at me or motioning at me to pop the gas tank release when I ve already done so  To be fair to Ford  I did buy the car used  and maybe in a new car the gas tank cover does actually pop open when you hit the release button  My oldest car is now a 1992 Buick LeSabre  I mention this only because in that car  the front arm rest doubles as a storage area for tapes  change and has a cupholder for two cups  In contrast  the 1995 Taurus  built 3 years after my Buick  uses a ridiculous split front armrest  thus wasting the space other manufacturers have cleverly exploited for storage  Oh  there is indeed a cup holder that can be pulled out from the dashboard  But its placement limits the size of the cups that can be placed there  A 20 oz cup of hot coffee must be mildly distorted and angled to fit in the cup holder  and more than once the cup has opened and spilled its contents upon removal  You also can t remove the cup or replace it without actually looking at the cupholder  once again limiting its usefulness I m not sure how to characterize the interior passenger space of the Taurus  Two adults can fit comfortably in front  and two adults plus a child will fit comfortably in the rear  But the car is just too narrow to comfortably fit 3 adults in either front or rear  However  the wagon does have a third seat that can be popped up from the floor of the rear cargo area  so  in principle  you can cram 8 occupants into the vehicle  although not very comfortably in my opinion Gas mileage with the car  with mileage approximately evenly split between highway and city driving  is about 20 miles per gallon The Taurus wagon has both a rear defrost button and a rear windshield wiper button  Unfortunately  the rear defrost control is not located with the other heater and air conditioning controls  and it s actually hidden from my view when I m seated in the driver s seat  so I ve always got to hunt for it when I want it  The rear windshield washer button is also obscured by the steering wheel  another annoyance Overall  I m satisfied with the Taurus  but the poor human engineering will keep me from buying one again  
Neg, My 1995 Ford Taurus with a 3 8 liter V6 was recalled for a head gasket replacement  There was not charge for the replacement  however a week later the timing gear cover gasket failed  requiring replacement of both the gasket and cover  a  726 repair  This repair was out of my pocket because that gasket wasn t recalled  even though the cause of the failure was similar to the problems with the head gasket  If you are considering buying a used Taurus  or Windstar  with a 3 8 L engine you may want to find out if the timing gear cover gasket has already been changed  Ford has issued a service bulletin on this gasket however I have been unsuccessful in trying to get a dealer to show me the actual bulletin  Other than this gasket failure  air conditioner problem  twice  and a window seal problem  the car has been trouble free br br  
Neg, I would like to start with a disclaimer  I got my  95 Ford Taurus used from Car Max back in early 1999  It had 50 000 miles on it  or so the odometer claimed  Only the gods know what the prior owners did to it  With that in mind  I bring you the Saga Of The Used 1995 Taurus That My Father Bought Me Because Of The Safety Record Lets start of with acceleration  my first pet peeve about this car  You re trying to merge onto a major interstate  traffic is going about 60 mph  your merge lane is going about 20 mph  What does your Taurus do  I ll tell you what mine does  it sits there and ponders life  existence  and the raising costs of tea in Nepal while I slam my foot into the accelerator  It makes a few half hearted chugs  It waits a few more seconds  Then  only then  does it condescend to speed up a bit for you I ve had some very  very close calls trying merge or get out of the way of a nut so driver due to the bad acceleration  Basically  you re more than fine if you re already doing speed of traffic and need to pass  but if you need to get put on thirty to forty miles fast  make sure the oncoming vehicle has a gap of roughly a mile for you to merge into  No joke Continuing  the front seat seems to be designed for and by chimps  Normal sized humans end up having to bend their heads back at a strange angle to use the head rest  and the way the seats are curved is almost exactly the wrong angle for my back O K  lets move on to cost of repairs  Admittedly  I bought my favorite little piece of automative engineering used  but still  here s a list of some of the repairs I ve had to have in the past three years  not including the 3000 mile oil changes I do religiously and all that jazz Water pump  fan belt   over  500  but it was in the middle of a snowstorm and the mechanic had me over a barrel Transmission  a week after the snowstorm  about  1 000 AC   Went dead towards end of first summer of ownership  spent  350  Went dead again  trusted mechanic still couldn t fix it after giving me two free visits  Ford Dealership said they might  keyword  might  be able to fix it for  1200  They said there were metal shavings in the AC  So I gave up  and now sweat my way through D C area summers Brakes   Had to be fully replaced  another  1000 gone Fan belt again   What s with the fan belt  Another  250 gone Aside from the more costly aspects of  95 Taurus ownership  the car is rife with smaller annoyances  There are handy little buttons beside the steering wheel that allow you to search for the radio station you want  It got harder and harder to get the buttons to respond in the first year of ownership  and the main search one just eventually stopped responding at all  So  if I bang on the buttons really  really hard I can still pull up preselected stations  but no chance now of scanning the radio without leaning way over the the out of reach radio  O K  I m short  but it still seems set awfully far left Then there s the drink holder  Ah  the glorious drink holder  Only certain medium coffee cups fit  A Coke can will slide right through  so I use the cigarette lighter thing under the cup holder to support cans of Coke at an awkward angle  If you get a large cup of coffee to start the day  you ll have to bend it at an angle and wrestle it out if you want a sip while driving  Gauranteed you ll slosh some on your cassette player or the front seat  I think the designers had major phobias about people who drink coffee and drive  so they were trying to discourage the practice Last but not least are the lights  if your front lights burn out  and there s someone at a place like Jiffy Lube you really hate  take it to them to get the lights changed  The poor dudes changing my burned out lights took two hours  no kidding  because they had to unscrew strange bits of metal hiding the screws for the actual lights  and they had to do so at a really odd angle  basically bruising their fingers  Glad I didn t even try to change those things myself  By the way  if your rear light cracks  you have to get the entire casing replaced  including the part behind the bulb  and it ll set you back over  100  Seemed silly to me  when it was just a bit of red plastic that had been cracked As you can tell  I m not a big fan of the Taurus now  It has a good safety record for collisions  room to sit five people  and a good sized trunk  It heats up nice and quickly in the winter  largely  I suspect  because the engine seems to kick out a lot of heat that the car can t use  
Neg, My family bought a 1995 Ford Taurus GL sedan back in  96  when the car was only a year old  At the time  the car was in excellent condition  with low mileage  and a clean interior However 4 years later  the hands of time have taken their toll  Our Taurus is now pushing 100 000 miles  and the car is definitely showing its age  and then some This particular model is a bare bones vehicle  I think it may have once been part of a rental fleet  Power is delivered by a wimpy 3 0L V6  which even when new produced a measly 140 horsepower  Most mid size sedans of its time easily eclipsed its power output  Now  five years later  it seems even weaker than before  The engine is mated to the standard transmission  in this case  an electronically controlled 4 speed automatic with overdrive  Ford transmissions are not known for their crisp shifts  and this one is no exception  The term  quot slushbox quot  never seemed more appropriate The entire car is tan  Not that there s anything wrong with the paint  in fact the paint quality is quite good  it s just so drab  This car s one asset is that it s invisible in traffic  Unfortunately  it s also invisible in the parking lot  especially considering that  95  if I remember correctly  was the year Ford Taurus out sold every other passenger car in the States  Thank God they weren t all tan The interior is  to its credit  pretty comfortable  The front split bench seat is comfortable  but my tastes lean more toward buckets  I also prefer a floor mounted shifter as opposed to this model s column mounted shifter  but it wasn t my choice  so I m stuck with it As I ve said  the car is showing its age  The engine has lost most of its pickup  what little it had in the first place  and the fuel mileage has dropped  The transmission s shifting has gotten even sloppier  if such a thing is possible  and the seats have lost most of their comfort All in all  if you re going to buy this vehicle  do yourself a favor  and find one with a better trim level br br  
Neg, The Taurus Line of vehicles started in 1989  the concept was borrowed from the German auto makers  Design a car that was ergonomically correct and customer appealing inside  while being fuel efficient and aerodynamic on the outside  This car had a great start in the eyes of the American consumer  Taurus had been the number 1 selling vehicle in the United States for 5 years  and customers loved it s pre  Euro  body shape that was very very slippery and fuel efficient  But sad to say Ford has lost site of the Target the American consumer s love of driving and appeal for performance and speed in a vehicle  I must admit  I own a 1989 Taurus S H O  and in my biased opinion  Ford should have continued along this line of thought  A family sedan that drives like a sports car  The 1989 Taurus S H O was a collaboration between Ford and Yamaha motors that met the theme It drove and looked like a family sedan  but had all the excitement and and appeal of a fuel efficient sports car  I still own the 1989 S H O  and still fully enjoy driving it  By the way this article was written by a single man  with no children  I pray that Ford and Yamaha motors will reunite for one more encore 2001 S H O  The newer Taurus lacks passion in the driving and performance departments br br  
Neg,  It simply amazes  me that the Ford Taurus is still in production  After many years of major transmission  engine  and general quality control complaints one would have thought this car would have landed itself in an early grave  Unlike many other cars that had caused their owners so much anger and grief  do to poor reliability  quality control  and lack of dealer support  i e the Hyundai Excel  the Ford Taurus somehow made it past all those thousands of unhappy customers and is still being sold for the 2002 year with the claim that it is  one of the best selling cars in America b For the 2002 model year  the Ford Taurus Sedan comes available in a multitude of trim lines that include the base LX  the SE  SES  tester  and SEL  The wagon is offered in SE and SEL trim  2 powerplants are also available  All trims besides the SEL come standard with the reliable yet anemic OHV 3 0 Vulcan V6  while a DOHC Duratec 3 0 V6 is standard on the SEL and is an option on the lesser trim lines  Transmissions include a standard  clunky  unrefined  4 speed automatic i Driving Impressions i  My tester  Taurus SES Deluxe  had the optional 3 0 DOHC Duratec engine  almost a  900 option  At one point in time  1996  I was impressed with this engine  but alas other companies have moved ahead with technology and for 2002 this engine just seems like it s lagging in the refinement department  Off the line  acceleration  with the Duratec V6 is fair  but the DOHC Duratec seems lackadaisical compared to the 3 0 V6 in the 2002 Accord and totally anemic compared to the  a href content 54731378308  3 5 V6 in the Nissan Altima a  On take off the Duratec almost strains to get this 3 500lb vehicle up to speed  Don t get me wrong  the car is not slow by any means  it just has to work much harder to get up to speed than the competition  The 4 speed fully automatic transmission coupled to this engine only makes accelerating problems worse  The transmission  while loads refined over the AXOD tranny equipped in the 1986 1995 Tauruses still lacks the precise shifting associated with cars like the Camry or even the Chevy Impala  Clunky automatic shifting between 1st gear and 2nd is still noticeable  and shifting too soon  high gear around 30 MPH is still annoying  as the car has virtually no power at this speed in high gear  so automatic down shifting and up shifting while driving through town is almost inevitable if you don t manually take it out of overdrive   Handling  in the 2002 Taurus is good  however like most family cars on the twistys  this car tends to lean which can be quite prevalent around bends at high speeds  The 2002 Taurus SES is not a bad handler for what it is  but like the powertrain  most of the competition has the edge in this department as well   Cruising  in this relatively large family sedan is not exactly another downfall for the Taurus SES but it s also not an attribute worth boasting about  When cruising at 60 65 MPH wind and engine noise can be heard in the cabin  but for the first time while in a Ford Taurus it did not bother me  With the older generation  wind and engine noise would get very annoying  and while it still can get annoying when accelerating under full throttle  the 2002 Tauruses are nowhere near as noisy  at least not with the Duratec engine  Since it s redesign in 2000  the Ford Taurus seems to take bumps much easier  and rattles are kept to a minimum  jolts are also much easier on the spine  I can remember driving the 96 1999 Tauruses and not believing how many rattles and unexpected jolts would be present on bumpy surfaces  There is a major improvement vs  the last generation in this dept  Hills are taken well  Surprisingly the Duratec V6 enables this heavy weight to tackle up to 7  grades without having to automatically down shift to maintain 75 MPH  and can even gain speed up these sorts of inclines if given good  right foot power  again without the need for the automatic to down shift   Braking  in the 2002 Taurus SES deluxe is average good  Despite this car having the infamous front disc  rear drum set up  it has standard 4 wheel ABS which help assure good  safe stops  I was somewhat impressed with braking  however I still feel that with the price of the  Taurus SES deluxe  4 wheel discs with ABS should be standard equipment  Even with the tall gearing  fuel economy  is only average  The EPA is 20 27 which is lower than the larger  less sophisticated 3 8 OHV engined Chevrolet Impala   Fuel Economy  gov  has more info on EPA ratings i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  of the 2002 Taurus SES is a mixed bag  While the car possesses many strong attributes  this car also has its obvious weak points  The interior vs its recent predecessor s is much more desirable  yet still remains cheap looking and the materials are still not up to par  For example  the dash seems dated  cluttered  and uninteresting  The instrument cluster is relatively small  but offers all the gauges you could want  Tachometer  temp gauge  etc  etc  are added for driver convenience and are very easy to read while driving  Some noteworthy  options  on the deluxe SES include  AC  6 disc in dash CD player  adjustable pedals  these adjustable pedals may sound cool in theory  but I feel Ford should have saved the money and used it on the poor quality leather seating  WWW  CARS COM has more info on all equipment that can be had with the SES deluxe trim  Standard amenities include your basic family bag  Dual air bags  4 cup holders  remote keyless entry  power everything  and cruise control  All amenities can boast that they are ergonomically friendly  however the stereo system is very cluttered  much like the systems in the Volvo line up  This system also falls short in the clarity department  and received terrible FM reception while driving through local mountain valleys  Seating is average  yet again falls short of the competition  My SES tester was equipped with optional front bucket  plastic feeling  leather seats with a  floor auto shifter  and console betwixt the driver and passenger  These seats offer good support and standard 6 way power adjustments  but due to the cheap feel they really put a hamper on certain aspects of my driving experience with this car  Wearing a T shirt and the outside temp being 55 degrees  yes that s all it gets here during the day  my arms felt like they were resting on ice cubes while first trying to get comfy in these pleather seats  The quality of the leather actually reminded me of the poor leather seating in my  a href

passengers will enjoy more than enough room for long trips  Storage is also good  Tons of room for a family of 5s  weeks worth of groceries  There are also many storage compartments throughout the cabin i Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior  of the 2002 Ford Taurus  while once looking like what many thought looked like a jelly bean back in  86  than a space ship in  96  has now joined the world of Plain Jane automotive design  There are large see through effect head lamps  and angled tail lamps  but this car still looks like every car you see on the Hertz rental car lot  The 16  5 spoke alloy rims  and optional spoiler do add some sport to this sedan  but still looks every bit the part of a car that was made to get lost in traffic  The loss of the dual exhaust system on the Duratec equipped models just makes it that much harder for this car to look sporty   Price  Reliability    Warranty i  With the 2002 model year coming to a close I m sure there are rebates out there on these cars  however my tester had none  and was priced at a whopping  23 000 without taxes  Reliability with the Ford Taurus has almost always been poor  I always hear from Taurus owners that their new car has had no problems  but after 3 years they are in the shop getting a new transmission  This has been the norm for these cars for some years now  and I am now getting complaints that the  99 models are having reliability problems  Not sure if Ford fixed any of these problems  but if this car is a  must  on your shopping list  and you can afford it  I would ask for an extended warranty  as Ford only offers a 3 year 36 000 mile warranty with roadside assistance   Other Cars To Consider In Random Order b i 1  Toyota Camry 2  Kia Optima  a href content 62942318212 http www epinions com

Neg, One of Newton s laws of motion states  paraphrased  that a body in motion tends to remain in motion  The principle under discussion is commonly known as inertia  Inertia  we all know  is not merely a physical phenomenon  it s also a phenomenon that exerts influence over such varied arenas as the stock market and personal relationships   how many couples do you know  for instance  that stay together far too long because the act of breaking up takes too much energy  Inertia occurs in the marketplace  of that we can be certain  One of the most telling forms of inertia is a consumer s attachment to a brand or to a model  Such devotion asserts itself in an  It done me right the last time  so I ll stick by it the next time  attitude  a sort of Tammy Wynette  model for consumption  We often sense inertia here at Epinions  especially in the Automotive category  where hardly a day goes by that I don t read a review stating that  I have always bought   insert car maker i  cars  In fact  automobiles may be the only consumer product in which inertia is an inherited force  hardly a day goes by in which I don t read a review that says   my  family  has always bought  insert car maker  cars Perhaps I grew up in an unusual family  my parents drove Pontiacs  Fords  Chevvies  Dodges  Chryslers  Oldsmobiles  Studebakers  Ramblers  you name it  they drove it some time in the fifties  sixties  or seventies  And so I never developed that somewhat slavish brand loyalty   and  I venture  the condition best described by the observation that  love is blind  But I know that there are a lot of blind consumers out there b America s Most Popular Car b Advertisements tell us that the Ford Taurus is America s most popular car  Note  however  that you can always tell when an advertising man is lying because his lips are moving  What  is  true is that the Taurus is  one  of the most popular cars ever sold in this country  and  if you lump Mercury Sable in with the Taurus  there are as many of them on the road as there are of any other vehicle  More importantly  the Taurus   an ugly  melted looking critter at its birth   marked Ford s re emergence as a power in the mid sized car market after more than a decade of shoddy quality  ill advised experimentation  and simple ignorance of consumer trends  Finally  America was making a car that was competitive against Japanese imports  so much so that it actually began making inroads into that import market  Hooray for American ingenuity and engineering As such  the Taurus developed a near cult following  giving a new generation a vehicle on which to lavish the family s Ford addiction  Suddenly if you ached to drive a stylish  dependable car  you didn t have to hide the Toyota from Dad or watch Uncle Stan sneer at the Honda  And so the Taurus  and its  name plate twin  the Mercury Sable  became Ford s  comeback kid  Three cheers for Henry  Edsel  and the rest of the Fords b Fast Forward to 2002  Over the years  I ve driven lots of Tauruses  Tauri  always as a rental  I ve driven them through snow  in the baking desert sun  at the beach  and on winding mountain roads  While I ve never been tempted to buy a Taurus  frankly  it s larger than I need  I ve never been unimpressed by the car  either  This is a vehicle that s always seemed to be a solid  dependable   if somewhat boring   performer  but then I d never reviewed one for Epinions  either  So here s my chance  after having looked at a 2002 Taurus with a critical eye b The Car  My ever faithful suppliers at Enterprise rented me a 2002 Taurus SE model  a four door  with the stock V6 Vulcan engine and a four speed automatic transmission  This particular model has a  convertible  front seat  which is a bench seat with a center panel that unfolds into a console and or armrest to create the illusion of bucket seats  The vehicle came equipped with dual airbags  power doors windows mirrors  cloth seats  AM FM Cassette  tilt wheel  cruise control  intermittent wipers  styled aluminum wheels  and AC  I picked it up with about 5500 miles on the clock  I turned it back in with just over 6000   five days and 500  miles  About 400 miles were highway driving  the rest on city streets and freeways in the Austin and Houston areas  Weather was mostly dry  though my return to Austin encountered some moderate showers b Styling Notes  For those interested in such things  the vehicle was a metallic charcoal gray with a multi shade gray interior  That particular combination is apparently quite popular  one night in my hotel parking garage I had to choose among the Taurus  a Mustang  and a Contour all in that color combination  I stayed with the Taurus  cause I didn t have keys for the Mustang This model was restyled by Ford with the 2000 model year  Speaking from memory  earlier models were far more dependent upon the oval motif  and still retained some of the original version s melted external contours  The restyling possesses slightly more angularity than the old version  with sharper slope breaks at the base of the rear window and on the trunk line  The interior has much of the  chunky  look adopted by many automakers in the latest  90s and early 2000s  Blocks of foam filled  naugahyde  tend to fight for supremacy with contoured plastic panels in the dash and on the doors  The seating arrangements do not appear to have changed from earlier models  and the instrument panel and dashboard layouts are little changed  if at all b Driver Car Interface  The Taurus handles moderately well for a mid sized family sedan  cornering is responsive with neither crispness nor poor control  The driver has a good connection to the road when compared to larger vehicles such as the Lincoln Continental  but is more isolated than when driving most Japanese sedans  Mitsubishi Galant  Toyota Camry  Braking tends to feel a bit mushy at highway speeds  The stock 155 hp Vulcan V6 possesses adequate reserve power at highway speeds  but is noticeably weak on acceleration from a standing start  this is the least powerful of three available V6 engines  I averaged about 21 5 MPG with this engine  note  mostly highway driving  The four speed overdrive transmission shifts smoothly and responsively for the most part  In this model  the shifter is mounted to the steering column The cockpit is laid out comfortably  with most controls easily accessible and few  if any  surprises  The intermittent wipers and headlight dimmer switch are located on the turn signal stalk  The cruise control buttons are on the face of the steering wheel  on off on the left and accelerate coast resume on the right b Driving Environment  The driver s seat in this configuration has a seat back tilt adjustment and forward backward adjustment  both manual  There is no lumbar adjustment  Driver seating is relatively comfortable  though the lack of lumbar support is somewhat bothersome  Rear seat entry in the four door models is a piece of cake  and rear seat room is average or above for vehicles of this class  There are sturdy anchor points for two child car seats on the car s rear deck There is a single small  rather strangely shaped glove compartment and the ubiquitous door side map pockets  Ford provides a single cubby in the dashboard for front seat passengers  Rear seat passengers have pockets on the seatbacks suitable for stowing a magazine and little else  There are two power ports  both in front  one doubles as a cigarette lighter  The rearseat passengers have two flip out cupholders  front seat passengers have two cupholders molded into the underside of the fold up seatbottom  This latter surface also has minimal storage for cassettes and a few coins  it dumps its contents when inverted  no surprise there  to form a seat cushion  The only locking space in the cabin is the glove compartment  Note  that when the seat is in  bench  configuration  there are no cup holders and little storage  probably moot  anyway  since the room would be rather limited The trunk is a capacious 17 cubic feet  although the sill is quite high  making loading cumbersome for shorter drivers and passengers  The circumference is notched for a cargo net  though there was none in the rental vehicle  it may be standard and have  disappeared  The lid opens with a key or a dash mounted remote  and there is also an emergency latch for opening from the inside  The rear seats do not fold down  nor is there any sort of  pass through  for carrying long cargo  a disappointing lack of a feature available in other trim lines and on competing models Engine noise is somewhat intrusive  partially because this particular engine seems to be rather  grumbly  Road noise is minimal unless the road surface is coarse  but wind noise is also rather pronounced b Highs and Lows  These are my personal observations about this Taurus model  with additional explanation where necessary i Positives  the Accelerator Pedal   good rear seat room  large trunk capacity  good climate control  clear dash and instrument panel layout  fuel economy i Mmmmm  Maybe  The Neutral Zone   engine acceleration  road handling and braking  an average climate control system  road noise and wind noise i Negatives  the Brake Pedal   no fold down rear seat  amateurish looking design to interior components  especially the  console  engine noise  a disturbing metallic rumble at idle  cheesy stock sound system  poor quality control  see below  that stupid front seat console and lack of interior storage b On Quality  One of the reasons many US buyers deserted American carmakers in the seventies and early eighties was the perception of poor quality in US cars  If all American cars are as poorly made as this particular Taurus  the exodus should begin anew  In only four day s exposure  I noted the following defects  The ignition key was hard to turn and more than once failed to release from the  START  position   this left the starter motor engaged until I manually released the key  At least one body seam had variable width along its length  a definite no no  one panel is therefore misaligned  There was a quarter of an inch of mismatch between interior panels on the back of the front seat  Flashing  excess plastic from the molding process  had not been trimmed off the interior of the trunk  especially in the clips for the cargo net  The fuel gage would not rise above 7 8 even when filled b Overall  Ford appears to have decided to rest on its laurels with this vehicle  and has not done what is necessary to keep it competitive with the Camry  Accord  Galant  Impala  and the like  I suspect they re counting on brand loyalty    inertia    to keep the Taurus selling while they expend all their energy on their SUVs  Not a good idea  Ford  Not recommended  for unimaginative exterior styling  some truly stupid interior styling  poor quality  and average drivability  There are better cars on the road  let s buy  them  instead i Tammy Wynette  country Western artist  perhaps most widely known for her counter feminist anthem  Stand By Your Man i  
Neg,  Maybe it s just me I But  my husband s white  2002 Ford Taurus SE  is bland  chintzy  and nothing to be proud of  The most redeeming quality of the vehicle is that it s his company car and we aren t forced to shell out our hard earned cash for the not quite mediocre piece of crap With that said  I have nothing against Ford or the Taurus for that matter  But  the fact remains that the auto giant made very few  if any  improvements over the 1999 SE model  I  in fact  have a sneaking suspicion that the company has gotten a bit too comfortable in the market and in the buying public  They have a built in audience that will buy a Ford Taurus regardless of higher quality and similarly priced competition  like my own lovely 2002 Chevrolet Impala LS   THE EXTERIOR  From the outside  the  2002 Taurus SE  looks pretty good  The style is a definite improvement over the late 1990 s  spaceship look  It in fact is a combination of the more popular earlier and boxier Taurus lines and the style popularized a few years back by creative Japanese auto manufacturers  The side panels are relatively blah  while the back and front are slightly attractive  Ford designers shouldn t be proud of their work on the car  redesigned initially for the 2000 model year As with the 1999 model  the vehicle has some issues with aerodynamics  The car should have been tested further in the wind tunnel  Why  Well  if you drive one and haven t yet noticed rode grime and mud collects in strategic locations toward the back bumper  It s not a major issue when you re driving but goes to show that the body isn t perfectly designed   THE INTERIOR  Upon sitting down in the bland medium gray interior  the first thing that struck me was that it looks and feels cheaply made  Considering the fact that the car retails for over  20K  this isn t a good thing  There are strange metallic decorations  a badly contoured dash  and not in the least bit attractive console  Fortunately for Ford  the console is nicely arranged and can be accessed easily by the driver  It s roomy enough for a mid size vehicle  though the seats aren t nearly as comfortable as some other similar vehicles The already uncomfortable seats have no features to speak of  You can tilt the back and push the seat forward or backward  Aside from that  the  2002 Taurus SE  lacks lumbar support and any of the other perks that are sometimes available  The passenger seat is similar while the back bench is a bit cramped and not particularly comfortable for riders  It would be good for small children  but by the time kids become teens the seat might be a bit too small With an adequate 17 square foot trunk  there is plenty of room in the Taurus  The trunk is rather thick  though is lacking when it comes to deepness  extending toward the rear seats  The rear seats are fixed and cannot be folded down in any way to allow for added capacity  This is a major flaw in the design The SE model we have came with a CD player with average speakers and no real bonuses  There isn t anything special to speak of about the temperature controls aside from saying   yes  there is in fact air conditioning  One minor complaint I have is that the visors are cheaply made and the back side mirrors lack lights  If memory serves  I do believe that the 1999 Taurus SE at least featured that luxury  Other standard features include power windows  mirrors  and brakes and keyless entry  Just don t expect any good surprises  This is a pretty stripped down car b THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE  I will admit that I m jaded because of the 2002 Chevy Impala LS  That car has a lot of energy  pick up  and is easy to drive  The  2002 Taurus SE  on the other hand feels like a dog  The usually adequate V6 Vulcan with 155 horsepower engine is slow to accelerate  The automatic shifting at times has problems between 1st and 2nd gears adding to the already problematic driving experience Once you get up to speed  the car functions decently  though not perfectly  Passing is a laborious process  What I can say is at least the brakes work well on both highways and city roads  The steering wheel mounted cruise control is easy to use and functions pretty well  Just a tiny tap of the brakes and the cruise immediately shuts off So far as gas mileage  expect to get an average of just over 20 miles per gallon  despite Ford s claims of higher  As compared to my Impala  with a much larger engine  that s not too good  That larger vehicle gets about 25 miles to the gallon on average  The Taurus  smallish engine should in reality be more efficient  So  basically  you get a low energy car with iffy gas mileage  Is this car sounding good to you yet  I hope not b FINAL ASSESSMENT  When compared to the earlier style model  the  2002 Taurus SE  looks nicer from the outside though it took a big step back with the interior  At well over  20 000 for this car  it s not a good buy  I would recommend buyers look elsewhere to the aforementioned Chevy Impala  the Honda Accord  the Toyota Camry  and even the Chevy Malibu before settling on the Taurus  It really is a disappointing vehicle b SPECIFICATIONS   3 Liter  V6 Vulcan engine 155

Neg, Having driven Ford Taurus  frequently from rental companies over the years  I have come to a love hate relationship  Now I have one of my own and nothing has changed This Taurus was not my choice   it is a company car which I use 100  of the time  for both business and personal use  Ford is slowly improving the style  particularly phasing out the oval shape of just about everything  The elimination of the oval shaped back window and the hardening of some of the exterior flow lines towards the rear of the car have helped its looks greatly This Taurus has a fairly smooth ride and a good grip on the road  Steering control is fairly tight Steering range is another story  I have never before had to back up and try again to navigate tight spots as much as I have to with this car  You get used to how far a wheel should turn on most cars   this doesn t even come close Inside  they have made attempts at comfort  though they miss the mark  The power driver s seat option is great and adjusts well  Having that also allows you to get the optional adjustable pedals  I love it  You will never again have leg cramps on long trips or find yourself adjusting your legs because the pedals are too far away or to close  This is particularly helpful for someone under about 5 7 Even with this comfort  your ride will be uncomfortable because the seats are cheaply done  They have little contour or padding to them  For someone who spends a lot of time in a car I would think twice here  The sun visors are cheaply done as well  They feel like painted cardboard  and are just about as thick  No luxuries like illuminated mirrors or extension for side facing sun  The interior is roomy  however  If you opt for the six passenger seating you will even find the middle seat up front to have good leg room One poor design is the armrest center console on the six passenger seating  Folded up for the sixth passenger everything is fine   except that there are no cup holders available to you  You can then unfold and open the armrest to expose the cupholders and the console storage area  while a second piece becomes the armrest  The major problem here is that there is no cover to the storage area  Anything you keep here   including coins in the coin holder   is in plain sight until you again fold everything up   leaving you with no cup holders again The CD player and stereo seem to work well  although CD and a cassette combination are not available  It also has a theft  remote lock and entry system So far  nothing has changed   I still have that love hate relationship with the Taurus  
Neg, I was given this car as a company vehicle when I first arrived in the US 2 months ago  My first thought on seeing it was  what an ugly heap  I was more impressed by the luggage space as it fairly easily swallowed all of the stuff a family of 4 carry when travelling to a new land Driving from the airport to the hotel I was immediately struck by how soft the seats were  Almost sofa like in comfort if you only travel for a few miles  Problem is that for longer journeys they are completely lacking in support and I was in agony after only 50 miles or so Next nuisance item was the multifunction stalk for controlling lights  wipers etc  Really  these functions should be seperated but the use of a column gear change prevents that  These column mounted gear stalks are very quaint  but personally if I never see one again it will be too soon Performance was  well how could I put this without cussing  absolutely useless  That thing couldn t pull the skin off a rice pudding  It is flatter than roadkill and only slightly more attractive  I don t know its top speed as I never felt sufficiently in control to test it  It felt like it would have trouble outrunning a moped but I never had the courage to try it Brakes are adequate without being startling  I did find that parking brake to be hopeless  Anybody living in a hilly area is going to become rapidly hacked off with not having a normal handbrake rather than the stupid foot operated system  It is impossible to gradually release a foot system so making fully controllable getaways a distant dream Handling  Handling  Nope  not on this thing  This is the sort of softly suspended barge on wheels American cars used to be like  This might have been acceptable in 1975  but things have moved on a long way since then  My last 3 cars were 2 SAABs and an Audi A4 so perhaps criticising the handling is a little unfair  Problem is that Ford s offering in this category in Europe is the Mondeo and it kicks bottom  Now that is a car they should be offering to the American public  rather than the shoddy heap of garbage that is the Taurus  
Neg, Well lets get right to the point I was a big owner of Taurus  I have own practicly all models except this one  Taurus has always been on the cutting edge for technology and power over most manufactures cars that are comparable to the taurus  One of the main reasons why Taurus made it into the nascar races because Taurus was building a name for themselves of making powerfull cars  in 1995 Taurus came out with their ultimate car which was the 3 8liter v6 SHO taurus folks let me tell you if you ever get a chance to ride in a 3 8 liter v6 SHO taurus do so because the minute that person lays his foot on the pedal your jaw will be in the back seat  Why am i bringing this up because this is all important do to the fact how ford taurus has progressed into a awesome car  That i kept buying because each year they kept getting better and better  Then all sudden the ovals came out and a smaller taurus  Then next was the smaller engine  when i ask the manufacture if they have more engine packages he said no 3 0 is it  Come on  So i forgave them and look into the interior i wasn t impress it wasnt up to par with the typical norm of ford taurus in the pass  It was cheap material  The hole dash board layout is totaly illogical  It came with a cassete deck has default and no cd player  I m sorry but cassete deck built into the dash  Cassete deck shouldnt even exist anymore in the car  I praticlly laughed my head off when i saw this  ford most still be living in the 1980 s  Most foreign cars if not all come standard deafualt with a cd player built into the dash  cassete then becomes optional and thats how it should be  Air climate control totally sucks should be digital and temperature driven by degress  They moved the unlock and lock on the up part of the door and not down where the fingers would normally be  who in the world came up with that idea they must have been smokin somethin  The spedometer totally sucks also you cant tell what the heck speed your doing  theirs more lines and dashes then their are actuall speed listings so you have to study the damn dash to figure out what speed you are doing  The console cup holders arent big enough  The sterring on the car seems like it has a huge understeer to it  It almost seems like you have to turn the wheel around 5 times just to get it to do a square corner  On the passanger side their is abosultey no place for you to lay you feet down flat  When you sit down your feet are always propt up on something  And of course i could go on with the list  The only good thing it has going for itself is the fact that it has a smooth ride  and thats it  o and the trunk size is decent  thats it  O just though of another bad the sound system in the car is terriable its really tinney sounding and the radio stations sound really far away when their not  Ford has ruined the Taurus and this model i will not buy  It breaks me heart to say this but i will probably not by another taurus until i see improvement  I will be heading over to the toyota series of cars now  Because it seems like the foreigns have more innovation and techonolgy in their cars now  Ford is still living in the 1980 s  And i do beleive when they came up with the ideas for this new series of ford taurus that they must have been smoken something for sure  
Neg, You d never see me buy one of those but I drove enough in a rental car to make myself a good opinion Quite silent at highway speed except for tire noise  Handling is not too bad and healthy  body roll is contained  brakes are strong enough in spite of the absence of rear discs Seats have absolutely no lateral support  which makes driving on twisty roads a real pain Auto gearbox 4th gear is way too long  engine lacks torque to hold it unless road is flat  Steering mounted gear lever is clumsy although it saves space for stuff between the seats  Upshifts are okay although not without hesitations at low speeds  but downshifts are slow Build quality is really average to low  I had the steering lock mechanism coming out inadvertently  Plastics quality and assy leaves to be desired  we are far  far away from Audi league  
Neg, 1995 E 150 Econoline  conversion by d Elegant  300 I 6  E4OD  3 55 1  aftermarket interior and exterior  7000  GVWR  aftermarket rear heat and a c Background I have owned and driven Ford vans since I was 16 years old  I started out with a 1970 E 200 with 240 cid I 6  I have owned Ford vans with almost every engine available in them  I have used Ford vans for solo commuting  recreation  hauling band members and band equipment  hauling merchandise for distribution  hauling frieght in the  quot Just In Time quot  expedited frieght business  hauling students  and now pulling my 25  travel trailer Currently I own a  94 E 350 Clubwagon Chateau  460 V 8  E4OD  4 09 1 differential Formerly the topic of this review  I owned a  95 E 150 Econoline conversion van  conversion by d Elegant  The front suspension on this van was bad from the day I bought it with 43 000 miles  It was back at the selling Ford dealer about 5 times within the first month  and then other Ford dealers and alignment shops thereafter  The last alignment that I had done was at a reputable truck spring shop  They told me that the front coil springs were almost worn out  Because of the aged springs  they had to change the bushings on the ball joints to the maximum angle to align the van  They stated the condition of the springs and bushings on their invoice and stated that the next time it is aligned  it will need to have the front coil springs replaced before they will align it  I know that this shop is reliable and trustworthy  but what about the selling Ford dealer  I had the salesman write in the sales agreement that the van would be properly aligned BEFORE I took possession of it  Well  I found out that it was never on an alignment rack before I took possession of it  After the sale  the service department at McCandless Ford in Mercer PA gave me nothing but lip service about aligning it  They even sent me out on the road with the technician so that I could approve the work  Well it felt good on the 2 lane road that we drove it on  but it pulled when I drove it home on the interstate  That is when I made the appointment at the spring shop to take a look at it  I think that Ford had a problem with the E 150 chassis in  95 and nobody told me about it The 300 I 6 engine was very economical  I normally got 18 20 mpg hwy  but it dropped drastically to 10 mpg pulling the trailer  A quiet engine  good torque  but no power to pull our 25  travel trailer up hills and keep up our speed  There was no room for acceleration when pulling the trailer The E4OD transmission didn t do to much hunting  However  I stopped the hunting by locking out OD when it would downshift the first time  I would then ride out the hill in 3rd or 2nd The 3 55 1 differential gave me no problems The conversion company is d Elegant  The short comings that I found with the d Elegant conversion is the bay windows by Creation  seating by Dygert  sub of Flexsteel now  and the aftermarket rear heat and A C  I experienced the wind whistling in one of my bay windows  I found the rear chairs to have seats as hard as rocks  and I found the after market air to be really weak as far as the blower and the freon  There is more to a vehicle than a pretty looking interior and exterior paint job This E 150 had a tow rating of 5000  and I bought a travel trailer with a 4900 GVWR  The 300 I 6 in stock condition would pull the trailer well if my speed was under highway speed  However on the highway  I could not ever maintain the speed limit if I were pulling any degree of upward grade  In fact  I was often locked out of OD to pull grades and even sometimes in 2nd gear to pull big hills  While the E 150 was good for economy  it was not a good camper toter I would recommend the drive train to anyone wanting a dependable truck engine  who is going to use it at lower speeds  I would not recommend it to anybody who is doing alot of highway travelling  I would not recommend any conversion van to anybody because the parts that the converters use I replaced this  95 E 150 with a  94 E 350  In the deal I got OEM quad seats  6 way power driver s seat with lumbar support  OEM rear heat and air  OEM windows  heavier front coil springs  heavier tires  heavier rear suspension  I am very pleased with my trade br br  
Neg, We purchased the 2000 Ford Explorer 4WD XLT Sport Utility Vehicle  SUV  back in August of 99  We previously owned a Mustang GT  and a Camaro z28   Yeah  Huge change  The reason we chose this SUV is because we were able to get the dealer to come off the price  and we needed an SUV or  Family Car  before the birth of my second child  Since our purchase we are extremely disappointed and unhappy with our Explorer  Don t get me wrong we enjoy the spacious seating  and all the options  But  the all around product is very low quality for the big bucks you pay Engine options for our model included 4 0 liter 160 hp V6  Which feels like very little power when starting out  For highway driving it handles okay  but has a lot of wobble feeling on the inside and you hear a lot of road noise  Our car is Wedge wood Blue with light gray interior  The body is extremely durable  We have had a very minor  3mph  fender bender and it done no damage to our rear bumper  but pealed off the paint and dented the other cars front bumper  The interior is really easy to maintain  We have two toddlers and you could imagine our fears with having the light interior  but I am proud to say that there has not been one spot that we couldn t get out  After about 3 months of owning this SUV we started having a weird problem with the windshield wipers  For some unknown reason while driving down the road the windshield wiper would suddenly turn on by itself and swipe the window about 3 times and then stop  We had one incident were they would not work at all  very scary  We of course took them in to get fixed along with another strange mechanical defect  the check engine soon light would always stay on  They fixed the windshield wiper motor  and said that a sensor went out causing the engine light to stay on  so they fixed that  Shortly after this day  we received a recall on the wipers During the next summer of owning this SUV we had a few incidents were the SUV wouldn t go in reverse with out putting it in drive first   Not good when in tight places  0P  The only happened a few times  and we called the dealer about it but said that they couldn t duplicate the problem unless it happened while they were looking at it  Well needless to say we never took it in because it stopped  But  it still bothers us Our latest problem with this really loud high pitched whining sound that comes from the under side  but only happen while driving under 20 MPH  and when its cold  Well  we took it into the shop  yesterday to be exact  and the darn thing wasn t doing it so they did nothing for us  But  What do you know it started doing it again that same night GRRRRR I know that all cars are not 100  perfect  and that these problems are minor  But the latest deaths  and Tire recall  as well as the big fears of the SUV rollovers   The one SUV that seems to be involved in most of the rollovers  is the Ford Explorer  These recent facts have brought my husband and I to the decision of trading in our Explorer for 4door car  If anyone asks me in the future what I think of the Ford Explorer I would say exactly what I have here  I would most definitely NOT recommend it to anyone br br  
Neg, Entering this vehicle without a key is easy  On some models  keyless entry systems are in use  This consists of a number pad on the driver door  The owner simply punches a combination to enter the vehicle   quot What s so bad about that quot  you say  Well the problem is this  If the correct combination is entered by itself or within ANY STRING OF NUMBERS  the door unlocks  A thief could find one of these vehicles in a dark parking lot and just sit next to it and punch random numbers untill the door opens  There is no time delay  and no maximum number of tries  I tried this myself  and was able to enter the vehicle after about 3 minutes of random number punching  Also  a permanant  quot backup quot  code is in the system in case you forget your personal code  This cuts the time it takes to punch the correct random number considerably  I would strongly caution anyone buying this vehicle to inquire with the car dealer as to whether or not this problem has been fixed on new models  As for those who already own one  I would consider disabling the keyless entry system br br  
Neg, I rented a Ford Explorer 2000 for 3 days and was unimpressed  This was an 8 cylinder and had less than 1K miles on it  The gas mileage must have been around 14 15  The first thing I noticed in the rental parking lot was the Firestone tires on the vehicle  The car seemed stiff to me in handling  The steering is tight and any small movement will cause the car to pull appreciably  So  it is easy to see how one could turn one of these over with a sudden yank on the steering wheel The interior was nicely designed  but the leg room was inadequate  I am only 5 5 quot  and found that I could not put the seat back far enough for my comfort  Also  I found that after a while  the seat felt uncomfortable  There were four different buttons for seat positioning  but two seemed to have the same function The interior was great for cargo space but there seemed to be even less leg room for the back seat area  This vehicle was hard to get in and out of because of the wheel height  Even using the running board  it was not easy to get into  I had to pull myself up into it The visibility is good since you are sitting higher than most other vehicles on the road  There are many settings and features on the radio and this one came with a very good quality cd player  The quality of the sound was good The locking mechanism was on a fob key holder and it worked well  Although I thought that they could have increased the sound to better hear the locking mechanisms for safety sake The power was okay   this one was an 8 cylinder   not impressive and not a real powerhouse  despite the mileage  or lack thereof I doubt that I would ever own one of these Explorers  I currently own a Jeep Grand Cherokee and have been a Jeep owner for over ten years  So  perhaps my bias is showing br br  
Neg, I test drove and was about to buy this vehicle  It is large and roomy  but somehow even on the luxury model it doesn t feel luxury  It has a very basic feel to it  After test driving this vehicle I looked this vehicle up in the Consumers Report  This car rated fairly well  but not great and for the price it should be great  The Toyota 4 Runner is about the same price and is of amazing quality and reliability  A friend of mine is a Account Executive for a large pharmaceutical corporation that purchased a fleet of Explorers for their account exec s  she also had just owned a 4 runner  and she said that her car has not been that great and is not that reliable  She insisted that I not purchase the Ford Explorer  First hand experience is a very reliable resource for information I am not telling you to not purchase this vehicle  I am saying  quot Do the research quot  It looks pretty  but if the maintenance and depreciation stinks  you re not getting that great of a deal  If you can buy another quality SUV  even if it s a little bit more  but it s not in the shop all the time and it has good value when you go to sell it  you have made out Shop wisely and good luck  P S  A little tip to save you money  Unless you off road more than once or twice a year  buy the 2 x 4 and not the 4 x 4  The 4 x 4 costs several thousands more and raises your insurance rates  Most people make the mistake of thinking that they have to have 4 x 4  You don t  You have truck handling and height for rough riding  a 4 x 4 is only really needed for off roading  soft sands  etc br br  
Neg, I recently had the opportunity to drive a NEW  less than 1 month old  Ford Explorer XLT  I approached this car with an open mind  I d heard good things  from my mother  the owner of the car in question  as well as bad things   from those who didn t own one  A spring break where I was to be the sole driver of this car should have been the perfect chance to bond with the new car  Right  Wrong At first glance  I liked the Explorer  The paint was nice  console was nice  leather on the seats was nice  room looked nice  When I stepped into the drivers seat for the first time  my good impression of the car began to fade  Due to the make of the seats  in order to have the back at a correct position for driving  the  quot headrest quot   just a continuation of the seat  was so far back that I  seriously  had concerns about major whiplash in the event of a minor fender bender  Despite trying different positions of the seat back  at no point could I get the headrest at a position in which to stop my neck from being whipped back in the littlest of accidents  The bottom of the seat was comfortable  however  which while a plus  didn t make up for the headrests I approached the Explorer thinking of it as an SUV  The front windshield would indicate otherwise  It s about the same size as the windshield on my Chevrolet Prizm  The size of the windshield isn t a great problem  but a fairly large annoyance  Because of the position of the console in reference to the roof  the rearview mirror is literally in the middle of the windshield  which makes viewing small items such as street signs difficult when in the correct position  I ve got to belive there is  some  design that could solve this problem  This car CANNOT take bumps  It is astounding to me that a new Explorer shakes so very much when going over the smallest of bumps  These are bumps that do NOT rattle any other SUV s including the Suburban and Tahoe  When a  95 Suburban takes the same bumps better than a brand new Explorer  I just cringe when thinking about how it will be in 5 years  Going down a fairly bumpy road  Expect to have a horrible headache from your brain being rattled around in your skull  even at speeds as low as 10mph  I really do love going to the gas station daily  Really  I do   especially when the snow is blowing horizontally in my face  SUV s  while known as gas guzzlers  do have standards  The Explorer has a  17  gallon tank  This is the same size as my boyfriends Toyota Supra  which  for those of you who don t know  is a smallish sports car  A 17 gallon tank wouldn t be so bad except when you factor in the mpg  In average city highway use  you get about 14 mpg if you re lucky  This is less than both the Suburban and Tahoe  For a car of this size to have such a small gas tank when the designers are aware of its low gas mileage  it s completely insane I tried to like the Explorer  but in the end  I just couldn t  I belive my first words to my mother were  quot Didn t you research this car before you bought it quot  I will be sticking to my original decision to buy a Chevrolet Tahoe   the Ford Explorer XLT just isn t worth it     
Neg, Momma said that if you can t say anything nice  don t say anything at all  Sorry  Ford  but I can t follow that adage when talking about my Explorer  God rest his soul I bought my 1990 Explorer  XLT  2wd  used right after I graduated high school in 1997  With about 120k miles  I ran it up to 175k albeit  a high number  but not outside normal boundaries within 2 and a half years  And  might I add  not without signifigant problems  Within those 30 months I replaced the transmission  2000  two air conditioner compressors  500  and it needed a third toward the end  the radiator  100 patch  that didn t work  and the replacement was a Chirstmas present  along with numerous minor repairs that only added to my frustration  electrical problems  faulty starters  leaky oil gauges that ruined some pants  etc  When it was running  I really enjoyed my Explorer  The gas milage wasn t terrible for such a big SUV  but still not too economical  which was only compounded with my other truck related expenses  I felt safe driving it  not too topheavy but quite sturdy due to its broad wheelbase  and had lots of fun piling up dozens of friends at a time for roadtrips  While the good outnumbers the bad  it doesn t really outweigh the bad  Friends with Jimmys or Blazers never had the ammount of problems I did  I wouldn t reccoment an Explorer to a friend  or even a despised enemy  It just didn t measure up to the expectations given to me by the SUV craze  I m musch happier with my Honda Accord br br  
Neg, I must say that when I leased my new Ford Explorer Sport 4WD it was to replace my 1998 Ford Explorer Sport  I loved the 1998 model  It was dependable  reliable and got me where I needed to be even in the worst weather  Even on the beach it was super  When my lease expired and it was time for me to choose another vehicle  I went to the same dealer and traded the 1998 for the 2000 model  At first  I loved it  Then came very minor things that went wrong that I didn t think should have been wrong with a BRAND NEW SUV  The dealership fixed these things without problems but then came the Firestone tire recall  I must say I would not recommend the Ford Explorer to anyone after this tire recall  It truly is not fair to be so down on Ford and I realize that the tires were not known to be defective when they were installed on my vehicle  however  it was the WAY THE RECALL WAS HANDLED  or should I say mishandled  that turned me off to my SUV  I was told my car was safe to drive  dependable and reliable  I was also told that even though my tires on this vehicle were defective  there was no need to worry and that I didn t need to replace them  If it made me feel better  they recommended I find the nearest Firestone tire dealer  go there and have them replaced but that it was NOT NECESSARY to do so  It was this mishandling of the incident that makes me hate this particular vehicle and I wouldn t recommend this vehicle to anyone  Furthermore  I took the SUV back to the dealership  told them I didn t have time to be calling running around looking for Firestone tire dealers and that since this vehicle was under lease and I didn t own it and since I have been a loyal customer to this dealership for many years  I felt strongly it was their problem and they should replace the tires  I was told next that I should contact Ford Motor Company in Michigan and take it up with them because the dealership had no intention of replacing these tires     
Neg, When test driving a new Ford Explorer  it is easy to ask yourself Why  How is this the most popular SUV in recent years  What has it done to deserve this achievement The Ford Explorer was once new in hip  but has quickly become painstakingly dull  The car has not evolved  seriously  in the last five years  The looks used to be daring  no they are overdone  The Explorer  drives more like a nightmare than a dream  The wheel jerks slowly  there is not desired glide effect here  The Explorer s interior as well is uninteresting  the best new feature theyve come up with is the CD dial on the steering wheel  Other than that the interior has somewhat of a cheap feel As the next millenium approaches it is time for Ford to think of something new  The Explorer will not cut it much longer  Maybe a 2001 edition of the Bronco  will bring trusty SUV lovers back into Ford s open arms br br  
Neg, Who wants one  ANybody  If you answered NO  give yourself a pat  and you can stop reading here  If you said yes  give yer self a kick in the butt  This sour lemon of a vehicle  oh where do I even start  How about puttin 2 pistons through the roof 4 months after I got it  Ok  I got a brand new engine  and since had no problems  Till a year later  I the jackass kept it The lemon would not start one day  So  I bring it to Ford   1700 later  I get it back running like new  2 weeks later  it rains  lemon would not start  I bring it to Ford   750 later  runs like new   Different problem  yea right It ran good for about 1 month  then it rained  I bring it to Ford   1200 later  runs like new  Next day  I went through a puddle  Not a lake  not a deep puddle  a little puddle on the side of the road  IT DIED  SO  it sat in my driveway for almost a year  rusting away  Ford explained to me many times  that each thing they did was a different part  and did not touch what they did last time  So  I had to pay all over again If you want to buy this Truck  my suggestions are Send Ford a check for your purchase price add on another  5000 for the repairs then just leave the truck at the lot so  it is not stuck in your driveway   
Neg, We leased this vehicle for 2 years  We began our lease in late 1997 just before our first son was born  thinking that it would be a great vehicle for kids  groceries  travel and all that First off it was an absolute pig on gas  Put your foot on the pedal and watch the gas gauge go down down down  It had guts  great passing power but you sure needed to feed it lots The 2 doors feature was kind of lame too  I would have changed that out of everything that I found wrong with it  Simply because getting a child in and out of a car seat is a real pain when you only have 2 doors  Then of course there were all the mechanical problems  From the electric seats breaking malfunctioning all the time making access to the back seat even harder  to the 4 wheel drive kicking on and off without notice  If the heating or cooling system was on while idling at a stop light you would hear this strange  quot clicking noise quot  which always made me nervous  This truck kind of reminds me of Windows 95 when it first came out it needed the bugs worked out before putting it on the market  And 4x4 it is not  I took my Explorer Sport onto a gravel road and down a somewhat steep and bumpy slope and I couldn t get back out without a lot of effort  My 1985 Toyota Land Cruiser makes the  97 Explorer look like a sorry excuse of a 4x4  that s for sure  And I could pretty much guarantee a flat tire each and every time I took it down a gravel road  5 flat tires in less that 2 years  I hear the tires on my truck have recently been recalled  so perhaps that had something to do with it The the paint began to peel off the front hood  the power windows would work some days and then not work the next  3 burnt out headlights umm should I go on Who should buy this vehicle  A Ford Mechanic I don t recommend it  Sure it looks good  and is fun to drive but who needs the headaches br br  
Neg, I can remember when the explorers first came on the market and I vowed I would someday own one  I loved the looks of them  At the time though we had only one child and room was not a factor  We have had our Explorer for almost 2 years and it wasn t the best choice of vehicles for us  We went from a Pontiac Minivan so the lack of room was definitely noticed  The kids never have enough room for their  quot stuff quot  and constantly fight over it  As far as driving an explorer  we needed a 4x4 because of our muddy roads and snow and it s rough riding  If you are wanting a leisurely drive I don t recommend the this vehicle  We have recently had some problems with it too  but it may be just OUR vehicle  It will not start on occasion and fortunately hasn t left me completely stranded  It will turn over but it sounds like it s out of gas  We took it in to get it checked but they can t figure it out  One minute it won t start and 5 minutes later it will      drives me crazy  In the are of comfort for me it s just not very appealing there either  I need room for my purse  and anything else I need for work and if I m the only one it s okay but get another adult in and there s just no room for us either I have to drive 18 miles one way to work every day so gas mileage is another factor  I only get around 17mpg  However  no matter what vehicle I choose I will be faced with this because I need a bigger vehicle that sits me up higher and has 4 x 4  Overall  I don t  quot hate quot  my explorer  but now that I ve had one I ve satisfied my curiosity and will not own another for a main vehicle  We should have chosen the expedition    If you have children I wouldn t recommend this vehicle if you want any room at all  However for a single person or two person family it would be fine  It will seat 5 but adults struggle to sit comfortably in the back     
Neg, I bought this car new in 1997 to replace my Nissan 240SX  I was looking for a vehicle that was both sporty  yet very roomy and capable enough to handle the winter s snow and ice  The ability to be a cargo hauler was required  The initial test drive  as well as the first 3 months were wonderful  The vehicle met all of my requirements  not to mention that I felt it was a great looking vehicle The problems started around month three  lasted for four years  and ended just two weeks ago when I sold that car  The minor stuff first  a major annoyance was the tight access to the rear seat  At first I thought I could live with it  but it soon became very annoying  That is really nothing to fault the explorer for  because 2 door vs  4 door is really a personal opinion  But some things are just downright ridiculous  In the four years I owned that car  I had the throttle body replaced six times  intake manifold gaskets replaced  various recalls   too numerous to list  and had multiple transmission and 4x4 problems  Just before selling the car  my explorer started to make a loud  clunking  noise as the transmission dropped out of gear every time I stopped at a stop sign  Equally amusing was the way it refused to go in reverse unless I first shifted into  Park  and waited 3 or more seconds  On top of all that  the body was starting to rust in four different places The dealer serviced this car every 3000 miles by the book  No matter what preventative measures I took   this car would break down  After 4 years I just learned to accept it  So 3 weeks after I made the last payment  I sold that car On the plus side  the front seats are relatively comfortable  The interior remained fairly squeek free  though in year three  the car developed a rattle coming from just behind the driver s side door  Also  the power and torque that the engine develops is very impressive I can not recommend this car  It is a service nightmare  If for some reason you feel the need to take the plunge into this Ford nightmare  spend as much as you can on an extended warranty  you will need it  
Neg, this vehicle is as good a car as any but not the greatest  I have borrowed my fathers 97 ford explorer many times for long trips or lengthy city drives and for these purposes it is fine  It is roomy and comfortable inside  it offers a seperate set of controls for climate and music aside from the front seats set  he chose leather seats which i personally do not care for so much but it also has a range of adjustment buttons for the front seats which can be nice  There is a temperature gage and direction indicator near the rearview mirror  His has a 6 CD holder and a tape player and a large area in the back for storage and such  I think this vehicle though was built from the inside out  They either were too concerned about minor inner details or put them all there to cover up the real problems  It seems he has had so much little troubles here and there and he shouldnt really have any at all with as new as it is  When the air conditioning runs in the summer  when you are sitting at a light you can hear it running poorly with a repeated tick in it  i have personally never been able to figure out how to convince the cruise control to operate  A mysterious breakage of a handle near the driver seat occurred and blame was placed but never accepted  It seems to me that they forgot to screw all the bolts in this vehicle tightly enough and while you are dazed and fascinated by all the pretty gadgets on the inside  there is chaos going on outside it seems to me that he also had problems with the driver window or maybe it was the MPH gage  when they went to fix it  they gave it back and it suddenly randomly began chanting that his door was ajar I think for the reputation of ford and the price and year of this ford Explorer  he should have had another 3 5 years At LEAST before little problems began appearing  That was not the case though  I would recommend if you are considering this vehicle  you may want to consider a few others as well  get any available review  reports and test that have been done to this vehicle br br  
Neg, While the Ford Explorer may for some be a terrific vehicle  two years with mine has me wanting more for my money  First thing I noticed about it was how the rear view mirror reduces the visibility when trying to see objects in front and slightly to the right  The mirror creates more front blindspot than I have ever seen in a vehicle  Definitely a safety oversight on Ford s part  In addition  the power windows have failed twice in the first year  the front tires have worn irregularly due to parts not originally installed for front end adjustments that need to be added  and an exhaust manifold that leaks which creates a tapping sound  The manifold problem has been addressed three times with the service department and the problem still exists to some degree  The service of my Explorer at the local dealer Merced CA  has been extremely poor  They have on three occasions not completed the work as promised and left me without a vehicle  offering no loaner  Add to this terrible gas mileage  and I m looking to unload mine  Sad thing is  the retail value is a lot lower than your dealer will tell you     
Neg, I was looking for the best sport utility on the market  and Ford said they had the best  so I went to go look at it  I was pretty impressed for what I saw  When I sat down with the salesperson I couldn t believe all the options the Explorer had  I told the salesperson I wanted power in the engine  but didn t want AWD  They told my option was a new 4 6 OHC engine that had 200 HP compared to the V 8 that had 215HP  After all was said and done  I leased the vehicle for 2 years When I drove the Explorer home I was very impressed  It had the power I wanted  and it drove like a car  Well  this feeling was very short  After a couple of months I felt like I was sitting in the engine compartment  It was so noisy I couldn t hear myself think  On one cold day in November I went outside to start the truck and heard banging coming from under the hood  I couldn t imagine what it was  I drove over to the dealership to see what it was  and the service manager looked at it with two mechanics and still couldn t figure it out  They told me to leave the truck there so they could run some tests  After a week of tests and a recall notice they told me I needed a new cam and the upper portion of the engine the truck only had 4000 miles on it  When I took the truck home it was still noisy in the interior but it drove well  The next year and a half had it s ups and downs  I returned to the dealership 41 more times to fix a bunch of problems  Some of the problems were  the L S R door was getting stuck  it started to burn more fuel then it should have  and it had a whole bunch of recalls If your looking to by a used Ford Explorer make sure you look into the maintenance history  The truck itself is a good truck  but Ford had alot of problems with the 1997 s br br  
Neg, Regarding my  soon to be EX Explorer  I can say very little positive about this vehicle  Now that my daughter is away to college  I am finally allowing myself to purchase my mid life vehicle  probably a miata This Explorer has been a nightmare from day one  Besides being somewhat over priced  the repairs on this vehicle alone could have paid for the note for a year  With in my first year I had to have the front suspension re worked  and the brakes adjusted 3 times  Always  it seems  not under the warranty  I dont know if this was the dealers fault  or the vehicle  but even though there were very few miles put on  all repairs seemed to fall under the wear and tear clause of the warranty  In driving this vehicle  I found that cornering was somewhat clumsy  and I was continualy feeling like I would tip over  Gas milage was what you would expect from a suv  it ran close to 15mpg  The carpet in the back pulled up from the edges  even though the biggest thing I would put back there were grocries or luggage There are many other SUV s out there that I am sure are better  but I am tired of them  It is time for something fun     
Neg, I bought my Ford Explorer XLT w 5 speed transmission new in 1997  I was primarily interested in the vehicle for its roominess and its 4 wheel capabilities during the winter months  Although I enjoyed the ride for the first few months  I quickly became disappointed with the gas mileage and at 45 000 miles I lost the clutch  900 and I only do highway driving  round trip commute Worcester Boston at 6 00a and 2 00p  I had not lost a clutch in a vehicle since my Volkswagon days back in the  70s  In addition  I am terribly disturbed by the cost of servicing the vehicle at dealerships labor costs have recently jumped to  70 hr  which is absurd  It now costs  500 1000 every time I take the vehicle in to be serviced suffice it to say  my next vehicle will NOT be a Ford Explorer To continue this saga eight months and 25 000 miles later a second clutch has been reported  quot burned quot  out from normal use  My driving habits have not changed from the above  And now the Ford dealership wants another  625 to replace this second clutch Ford will not stand behind its product  so i am dumping this lemon into the laps of the dealership  I have been driving standard transmission vehicles for 30 years and never have I had to replace a clutch in any vehicle with less than 100 000 miles in it  Ford is the worst vehicle experience of my life  They will no longer have my business br br  
Neg, It seems as if Ford is still in it s constant struggle to produce a quality automobile  My Family and I purchased a 1997 Ford Explorer used from a dealership  The Explorer cost us roughly  23 000 and came with a leather interior and was almost totally loaded except for a sun or moon roof  When we bought the Explorer she had already lived about 33 000 miles of her nasty  painful life  After about a month with no problems  the brakes started to give us trouble  Then about a week later we realized another problem  You can only fit the little munchkins from The Wizard of Oz in the back seat  The cargo space however was very good  and if needed  the Explorer can be used as a truck  All of these things are very trivial  compared to the typical problem with Fords  that we encountered about 8 months ago  The transmission failed  However after this we were o k  The transmission failing once was not a problem  We got it fixed  and nobody got hurt  The true problem was 1 month after the transmission failed  300 miles since the 1st transmission failure  The transmission failed again  Many of my friends drive Explorers  and among the 6 or 7 that do  I have only seen 1 other case of transmission problems  and only 2 more cases of problems in general with the car  However  you can say why I must vent my dislike for the Explorer  We now own a Toyota 4 Runner  and it performs great  It is an excellent car and anyone who likes can read an epinion i wrote on that  If you can pay the little extra bit of money for the 4 Runner  then you will most likely save money in the long run  If you do however choose to buy an Explorer  get a long term extended warranty  because you will need it  If anyone would like more info on these 2 cars  then you can e mail me at Odoyell hotmail com    
Neg, I have owned a ford explorer sport for about two years  I love the ride and the extras but the engine leaves something to be desired I had this vehicle for about three months and the engine siezed up and had to be completely replaced what a disaster A friend of mine had the same excate SUV and the SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM  Ford sent him a letter and told him they were aware of the problems but as if yet there as never been a recall or an offer to exchange the engine before it leaves you stranded on some lonely road I still have this SUV but refuse to drive it on trips because of the questionable reliability br br  
Neg, I recently was in the market for a used  SUV  I went to the Ford dealer  to see what was in their used car stock  The salesman told me they had just received a 97 explorer on a trade  and he thought the car was in excellent shape  I took his word for it  and took the car out for a test drive  Let me tell you  this car was from from good shape  It drove terribly  The steering was loose and out of control  the engine sounded like it was going to explode  and the acceleration and power were nowhere near what i expected them to be  I told the slaesman what i thought and walked out of the dealership  That testdrive indicated to me fords quality  and their desire not to have you pleased with your car  but to make a sale no matter what     
Neg, I purchased two new Ford Escorts in 1996  One  a manual transmission  for my daughter  The other  an automatic  for myself  The price  looks  Sunrise Red  handling  safety and comfort were perfect for us  They both are 2 door  hatchbacks with alloy wheels The driving has been smooth and comfortable  The Escorts  operating cost has been minimal  I have not had any problem with the engine of my automatic  My daughter has had an overheat light that comes on and had to be repaired twice  The light was a false alarm and the car never overheated Both of us have had problems with the vehicle speakers  One or more speaker had to be replaced in my daughter s vehicle  This was not too suprising since she was in her early 20 s when we first got the cars  My left front speaker fizzled last spring and needs to be replaced  My daughter had a speaker and radio on order which still hasn t come so she bought her own and replaced them This is the biggest problem we have had with the cars  Parts covered under warranty are taken off taken out and put on order and we still don t have them  There was damaged plastic molding on the side of my car which needed to be replaced immediately  It took a couple of months to get the piece so it could be replaced Both cars have had speakers on order since last spring  My daughter has played taxi to the city of Minneapolis so her car has more than twice the mileage on it than mine does  They are still running well without major problems It is a good  quot kid car quot  The Escort takes a lot and keeps on driving  A good solid car for a little economy which will pile up a lot of miles without repair     
Neg, I bought my 1996 Ford Escort in January 1997 with 9 000 miles on it  I drove it with only minor problems until this last year  Over the course of the last 6 years we regularly maintained it  changing the oil every 3 000 miles  The speedometer broke with around 25 000 miles  but was still under warranty  The AC went out on us in early 2001  The cost to repair it was outrageous  but fortunately a mechanic asked if it was a dirty plug  connection  or something  which it was  so the problem was fixed for around  60 The interior is fairly comfortable  The cloth seats held up well  Rear speakers stopped working after the second year  Instrumentation is easy to read  however  the  check engine  and  check coolant  lights came on at random times and after numerous diagnostic tests at around  70 dollars a pop  we learned that they just like to do that  Leg room is sufficient although we are fairly short people  both under 5 10  My husband always had to drive with a travel pillow behind his lower back on long trips  but I was fine  We definitely wanted to stretch after a few hours  The paint on the rear bumper is faded  Gas mileage was fairly good   we got around 30 mpg on the highway  unless the AC was running and then that sucked it down much faster  If you have children  know that the AC does NOT reach the back  even though it s a smaller car  Our baby was always bright red even with it going full blast  And while the AC is on  you will not be going over any mountains  We turned off the AC then because the car felt like it was straining We replaced the windshield twice  150 each  new tires twice which are NOT a standard size and so are much more expensive  between  55 and  75 each  and a new front and rear engine mount  200 Now as to why I am writing this review  In July 2002  the same month we paid the car off  it stopped in the middle of traffic while my husband was coming to the airport to get us  At 86 000 miles  regularly maintained  the car needs a new motor  The cost to purchase a used motor will run around  3 000  A new motor will cost  5 000  After speaking with several mechanics  Ford dealers  etc  everyone has told us that the cost to repair the car is more than it is worth  Yes  it is  We are now without transportation  with a toddler and one on the way  We did not expect to be in this situation for years based on the reputation of Ford  But we are  No trade in value  no chance to sell it  no car  Everyone says  that s so unusual  they don t normally do that  Well  mine did  I would recommend staying away from Ford Escorts  Replacing a motor at 86 000 miles is ridiculous  We will not be buying a Ford again  
Neg, We bought this car for price and fuel economy  as a 2nd car It is a reliable car that gets good gas mileage Unfortunately  it is microscopic  the ride is unpleasant  it rattles like crazy uncomfortable seats  no features  and if it came into contact with anything larger than a basketball it would be smashed to bits  Not a fun car to own  buy only if desperate You feel every pothole like you are being dragged over it face first  and it rides as high as a skateboard  The front seats are bearable  but the back seat is quite possibly the most unpleasant place on earth  It s acceleration is weak from its pitiful 1 3L four  but it can nip in between cars and gets you where you need to go though I wouldn t take it on the highway at gunpoint  I could almost call it sporty if its top speed was higher than 85 mph  But all it is is a small hatchback  nothing more  Go for a sedan  you probably shouldn t buy this under any conditions  Its only plus is that it never needs repairs  but we never use it much  it has 25k on it  that s all  Much more and I m certain there would be more problems  It s lack of power locks and windows is infuriating  I d more than trade the power seat belt for those What s more ironic is that this is the GL model  which by all rights should be better br br  
Neg, I am not intimately familiar with the Ford 350 Series  beyond reading the corporate blurb graciously provided by Ford  However  having observed  quot up close and personal quot  some of the driving done by 350 owners  as well as some proud 250 and 150 owners as well  I feel qualified to comment on one aspect of the vehicle That aspect would be the snappy  space age appearance of the front end  Pickups  and Fords in particular  used to take a perverse pride in being utilitarian and ugly  but those days are over  I can say this with complete certainty  as I have been privileged to have been able to catch many a close up view of the lights  grill design  general aero look  and ubiquitous Ford emblem in my rear view mirror  usually while traveling at or slightly above the speed limit in the righthand lane  Apparently  this vehicle imbues its operator with the notion that it is made to be driven in the manner of a semi  like  real close to your rear bumper  in the mistaken belief that such roadway bullying will cause me to speed up  pull over  or spontaneously combust  At night  this unseemly intimacy is generally accompanied by the use of high beams as well   I am working on a device that will refocus incoming light back onto the offending vehicle s radiator and boil it dry  My usual reaction to such foolishness is to ease off the gas a tad until we re both going about 10 mph slower  so as to get an even better view of that fabulous front end  and perhaps even sneak a peek at the smoke coming out of Zippy The Pinhead s ears  I m not ready to switch vehicles just yet  but it is a comfort to know that when the day arrives  I need but to tap the brakes to facilitate some timely financing for my next vehicle Anyway  congratulations  Ford  for designing a front end that fills my mirror  and other too  I m sure  with a view of serious design thinking and implementation  I m not trying to leave Chevy and Dodge pickup drivers out of this   they can certainly be irritating in their own way  but not with the panache of the Ford  It may be Found On the Road Dead  but ya gotta love the way it looks when it does br br  
Neg, The F350 v10 Longbed Crewcab has a hidden problem that Ford has documented  but does not freely inform the buyer that there is a problem with the rear drive line  In that due to its length it has the potential to vibrate at highway speeds due to the angle inwhich the drive line sits I found out the hard way by purchasing this  35000 00 vehicle and dealing with the dealership run around  The vehicle was returned due to the fact that they said that the problem could not be fixed but that it would not damage the vehicle to drive it that way  That was all fine and dandy but when I asked them to put that in writing so that if that part failed they would fix it for as long as I owned the vehicle  to me that means that we re not willing to back up our product but have a nice day  The vehicle was givin back although it had a comfortable riding with plenty of room for the family as well as for hauling  Excellent power and fuel mileage for this large of a vehicle  In all its a good looking truck that I would purchase again but only if they have fixed the potential problem with the drive line br br  
Neg, I live in the Houston area so seing a big truck driving down the road isnt anything special  but seing one of the new F350 s crusin down the road just leaves me at a loss for words  I love theese trucks  They are solid work horses that can handle just about anything you throw their way  We use them for pulling big 5th wheel car trailers to the race track and hauling our cattle trailers around  but they are more than just work horse  They are also beautiful  on the weekend it makes a perfect truck to take out on the town and with the crew cab their is room for plenty of people  When its at the track we get just as many compliments on it as we do our 8 second camaro     
Neg, If you do daytime only driving  the Ford Escort is the car for you  In the two years of owning the car  we had the pleasure of installing four headlamps and two taillights  This became my husband s hobby  I am distressed that since we have sold our Escort  my husband has no past time  He sits sullenly  looking at our non Ford Escort car  and he begs me to let him replace the working headlamps in that car  just for fun I m still trying to get my husband interested in Parcheesi The car was easy to get in and out of  once you pushed the weatherstripping back into place  The car held four people comfortably and the back seat was roomy  The blue color we chose seemed to be very popular in the Detroit area Only a four year old s tricycle has less power than the Escort  that is if Dad is not pushing the vehicle from the back  The engine noise was loud enough to drown out the words from the rider s in the back seat  and there were so many shake  rattle  and rolls in the body  even the mechanic that worked on the car shrugged his shoulders  and gave up trying to find the cause Driving this car is an enjoyable experience if it is the first car you have ever driven  and have nothing to compare it to I would recommend this car for the  quot little old lady quot  crowd that drives 3 miles to the store and back  every other Friday  around noon  during the brightest light of the day Anyone else takes the risk of needing a seeing eye car br br  
Neg, Being that I rented at least 5 of these babies makes me wonder has ford just totally and completely lost it beyond all measure  I don t even know where to start  lets go with Exterior  Exterior actually doesn t look to bad  I would even go as far to say that it actually looks sleek and somewhat sexy  The paint job is not very good though  I have already notice on many rental cars I have rented the paint starting to wear away in places  Which can be scary if you want to purchase a Ford Taurus  The headlights and taillights are pretty good no complaints their  Dashboard  It so obvious that the designing and quality stop right at the air conditioning vents  Considering Ford actually put a cd player in the car this time is quite surprising to me  Finally they step out of the 1980 s with the old cassette style  I found the radio controls and cd controls to be very confusing and on more then one occasions they have almost proved fatal while I was driving  Just to change radio stations is difficult while driving  Considering the fact alone that changing cd tracks in the car is close to impossible  Theirs a button for everything on the dash  A button for bass a button for treble for fade well you get the point  With all these buttons its close to impossible to figure out while driving what button to press to change the radio station or change cd tracks  It becomes almost a point of aggravation you almost feel like ripping out the entire dash at times  Anyway onto the drivers dash area  I find the dash board to be pretty lit at night with red glows etc  My major complaint is the fact you cant tell what speed your doing theirs more line and dashes then their are actually speed postings  So yet again another dangerous feature you will be studding the speedometer allot trying to figure out exactly what speed your going  Moving on to the passenger side  The Passenger side mystifies me totally  The passenger side Dash sticks out like 12 inches more then the Drivers side does  So the passenger will be pushing his seat back all the way just to get the maximum amount of leg room he can achieve in the passenger side  Bad side is in return the backseat person behind the passenger will become very cramp and will run out of leg room  Plus when your in the car this looks really stupid because the Drivers seat is not equal to the passenger seat in anyway  It makes the interior look completely uneven when sitting in the car  Also while where on the topic of passenger side dashboard we might as well bring up the fact that the passenger side dash is huge I mean my god its like something that came out of a horror movie or something the passenger side dash area literally takes up the entire passenger area  That includes the leg room area as well  What was ford thinking when they did this I don t know  Electronics  ABS  on some model  Cd player  radio  Driver Information how many miles to E  Average miles per gallon  how many miles done  Driver and Passenger side airbags  Cd player quality is ok the speakers could be allot better and I do mean allot better  Driver Information is nothing new ford should have done this years ago  Radio quality is good  IT comes with a trunk remote entry and keyless remote entry  Leg Room I find overall leg room in the car to be very poor  Infact the only seat that has the most leg room is the Driver seat and that is no joke either  Seat Comfort All four seats are at first comfortable but after about and Hour of sitting in them they provide very little support  So your thighs and your butt will start aching terrible Trunk Space The Trunk Space is actually pretty big and is probably the most major plus about this car  The trunk can hold two full size suit case one on top of each other and a travel suit case to the right of the full size suite cases and then it can hold some travel bins towards the front  It can hold a full size garment bag as well  So trunk space is deffintley good on this car Quality and Craftsmanship  What can I say the material is very cheap on all 5 I have rented the seats are already tearing in certain places  The whole car feels like its been put together by plastic  Also the car always breaks down  All 5 I have rented One I had the air conditioner fan go out  The other I rented the Engine believe it or not just gave out and the car only had 5 000 miles on it  I was just driving it down the road at 60mph and the all of sudden silence  I called AAA I told them it was a rental car  So they went ahead and picked me up and drove me to the nearest Hertz and I ask the Hertz if they could ever tell me what was wrong with the car  I was just curious the guy gave me his number and said call him up in about a week I did and he told me the shop quoted that the Engine had completely been shot he and I were surprised considering the car only had 5 000 miles on it  He said the car was covered by warranty anyway  So I was off in another Ford Taurus  This one was going well until The cruise control decided to quit and not work anymore  I tried everything to get it to work again but it failed to work  So after I was finish with business I return the car told them the problem  So I had another business affair I had to go on so Hertz yet again gave me another Taurus I was like what problem does this car behold for me now  Driving down the road I thought come on something gotta go wrong well a hour of driving went by and nothing happen  I was like men a Taurus without a problem  Well boy was I wrong  All of sudden when I went to do a lane change my blinkers weren t working nor was the wipers working either  This was not so good as because it look like up ahead it was going to rain  And I definitely need my blinker because I was coming into heavy traffic  So finally return the car to the Original Location and I finally stab another Taurus  This one actually had no problems  Expect that the engine kept making this knocking sound ever time I accelerated  Which concerned me a great deal  But some how it actually survived the trip and the return to its location  Personally I consider the reliability to be very poor  And ford should be very ashamed presenting a car like this to the general public  The car itself is ok at best if everything is working correctly  I don 146t know if I got a bad batch of Taurus or what  But these Taurus folks where cars with less then 10 000 miles on them  Personally I be very scared to buy one of these suckers in fear of god knows what going to go wrong with it  Maybe the breaks could fail that would be great  I wouldn 146t doubt it with the way the car was made  The Ride and Steering The ride is probably the big plus the rid is very smooth and very plush  The steering on the other hand is responsive but it always feels like it has a huge under steer which makes you feel like the car is going to lose it every time you take a steep turn  Overall I believe that if you really have to buy a ford Taurus buy one used and drive it around and hopefully the used one will have had all the quirks worn out before you finally get to it  I highly recommend that you don t buy this car  The 94 and 95 model Taurus Was Taurus best year and that more then likely will be their last best year  I think Ford should just scrape the ford Taurus or outsource the Ford Taurus to somebody that can really make it a fine car  Considering that ford lowered that engine models from 3 8 to 3 0 which makes the newer model ford Taurus always seem under powered  Ford is living in the past  I do believe Ford needs to take a real hard look at the foreign cars and start implementing what the foreign have and that also includes the quality to  I believe a better buy would be The Dodge Intrepid if you want American  If you want to go Foreign go for Honda Or Toyota Camry  
Neg, I purchased a 1991 Ford Explorer XLT 4x4 in the spring of 1991  I trusted Ford since my 1986 Bronco II 4x4 had lasted so long  But with another kid on the way  I need 4 doors and extra interior space  Since the Explorer at that tiem was basically a stretched Bronco II  which in turn was a ranger with a backseat  I decided to buy one  The impresions were good  I drove one and compared to the GMC Jimmy  it was much roomier  and so I ordered one  I ordered a fully loaded XLT which had more options the way I ordered it than the standard Eddie Bauer  The first 3 years were fine except for the squeaking doors  the interir remained large and it drove nice and looked handsome  and with my silver and blue two tone paint scheme  there were no other explorers that looked like it  Then things started going bad in 1994  The whole exhaust system was leaking like mad and then the muffler fell off  I replaced the whole thing with a borla unit  A couple months later  my first transmission failed  It not only failed  but beforehand it refused to shift out of second gear  so it was constantly bouncing off redline  I had my automatic transmissiion replaced out of my pocket  A short time later in early 1995  that transmission completely failed while my son was driving it  Another expensive 4 speed auto out of my pocket  By this time  the explorer was looking elderly  with a couple rust spots and with a bit of collusion damage to the rear bumper  Soon after  the hubs and 4 wheel drive system started giving me problems  so I traded it in for  10 000 in july of 1996 for a new 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 5 2 litre 4x4  I always wondered who bought that lemmon of a car  until I had another encounter with it last week  My younger son and I were in our current car  a Lincoln Navigator 4x4 when on interstate 70  an older explorer that looked identical to our old soldier  albiet grille less  extremely dneted in rear left door  ripped seats  and cracked glass pulls out in from of us  I remember asknig my son   quot I wonder how many transmissions he s been through quot br br  
Neg, I ve always liked Fords  and Explorers for that matter  but my third one put me over the edge  All three were bought used  between  9K and  12K  and all three were stock 1991 Explorers  two Eddie Bauers and my favorite of the three  a Sport  First of all  I like alot of things about Explorers  To be general  I like the size  the feel  steering and handling  the design  the price  and the look  It is a very practical SUV  it tackles most off road trails  minus serious 4 wheeling  it performs well  it gets decent gas mileage  91 that is  new ones are much more efficient  it is easy to service  and it comes from an AMAZING car company  Ford helps define American cars  My complaints  fuel pump  anti lock brakes  power steering  transmission  radiator  overheats  minor electrical problems  starter alternator  You d be amazed at the re occurances of many all of these problems in my three vehicles  Maybe it was a bad year  maybe we picked three lemons  but they all fell apart  We had the first one for two years before it was totaled in an accident  We put 4 or 5 thousand dollars into it just to keep it alive that long  Power steering went first  then the brakes  rotors  pads  calipers  the works  followed by hard starting and overheating  The transmission was the last to go  along with an overhauled 4x4  We were pretty happy with the car  despite little things like the backseat armrests falling off  When the time came  we opted for another  Enter the two door Sport  I loved that car  I felt very in control with it  and it was incredibly maneuverable compared to the XLT or Eddie Bauer  It had plenty of room  got better mileage  had more  zip  was easier to wash  performed better  and was just a fun car to own  Unfortunately  it had every problem I mentioned before  Power steering  BAD  fuel pump  alternator  transmission  and electrical glitches  passenger window didn t operate  power locks were broken  The transmission was never replaced  but it would have  along with a badly leaking radiator  if the anti lock brakes hadn t failed  the right front tire locked up  and totaled the car  Another one bites the dust  The third and current Explorer started off flawless  and the previous owner gave us his personal guarantee that the car was in perfect mechanical condition  It probably was until it fell apart on us  We had the car less than 3 months when  on a short road trip  the engine burnt up melted DIED  No warning  just occasional temperature fluctuations from normal to way hot  and back to normal  The engine was very expensive to replace  compared to other engine jobs my friends and family has encountered with other vehicles  By the time the new engine was broken in  the starter started to go  the rear hatch power lock broke  the oil pan and gasket needed to be replaced  and the transmission started to slip  The transmission hasn t been fixed yet  but it is about to drop  I don t think I have anything nice to say about this last Ford  as it is a true lemon  The sound system was very mediocre  considering it was their  premium  JBL setup  I only wish I could learn my lesson about Explorers  or Fords in general  but I can say now that I m probably not on my last Explorer  They really are fun cars  and they are very moderately priced  or at least as moderate as any used car today could be  If I had a choice  I d go for a full size Chevy Blazer  staying American  but I know I d be paying a higher price tag for it  If I ever get another Explorer  I d buy a few years newer  like 1994 1996  I hate looking at new car prices  and I would surely opt for the Sport br br  
Neg, A few years back  1991 to be exact  my dad purchased a Ford Explorer used  with about 20 000 miles for 10 grand  At the time  it was a good deal  and it turned out to be a smart investment  I enjoy the features it comes with  nice stereo  leather seats are comfy  good for the outdoorsmen  The only really obvious negative qualities is the backseats  and the shocks  The backseats are really uncomfy  despite the leather seats  It doesn t raise up high enough for me  it was uncomfy when I was 5 5  and now that I m 6 feet it is killing me  Also  as someone getting a driver s license soon  I have a permit  I don t enjoy a bumpy ride  I prefer my mom s 94  mercedes 520SE  I think it is the shocks that cause it to be so bumpy  It isn t horrible  but if you hit a pothole it could throw you off the road  Also  on another note  the engine began having some problems after 10 years  We had to get a new one  Overall  good suv with nice features  and a couple of halting problems br br  
Neg, I drove a 91 explorer on a road trip from Texas to New York  I beleive it was a 2 wheel drive XLT model with all options except leather seats  This truck was nice in that it provided a nice view of the road  felt strong during all driving conditions  and provided more than the required cargo rrom for all of my gear  However  there was a huge downside to all of this  To put it as simply as it can be said the truck constantly felt like it was out of control  Braking distances were super long  it bobbed and wallowed over the smallest raod imprefections  and every turn made me wonder if a roll over was going to happen  Ford did a terrible job of engineering this thing  The wheel base is way too short and the center of gravity is way too high for a vehicle that is so massive  People are sort of lured into a fasle sense of security with these things  Just because it s classified as an SUV  they think tahy can do anything and go anywhere  The problems Ford and Firestone are having come as no surprise to me  The safetly issue when through my mind back in 1993  when I took the trip  Firestone my have designed a bad tire  but the trck is also to blame for so many deaths and injuries  On a typical passesnger car  a blown tire may cause a collision  but definately not a roll over  Usually the most danage suffered by a motorist with a blown tire is a damaged wheels  This is not so with this truck  The thing that is most shocking about this is how people have continued to buy this truck after the safety issues surfaced  I suppose that can be attrbuted to SUV s being status symbols instead of practical transportation  Face it  if you have children  admit that you do and dn t try to be all tough and rugged looking in one of these death traps  Money would be better spent of a station waggon of some type from a BMW 3 series  for the snooty sort  to the Volvo  for safety minded people  to American wagons  i e  taurus for economy buyers  I really hope the congressional hearings uncover some type of cover up by Ford and result in a massive recall where all Explorers are bought back from owners and scapped we will all be safer     
Neg, UPDATE Well  at the bottom of this review I stated that I would keep the  tour unless something major went  it did  At 124 400 miles  the power steering rack failed  Since the V6 contour is relatively rare blah blah  it was going to freakin  expensive to fix  So I worked out a deal with the dealership that I would buy another car from them if they covered the repair   I know  another ford I must be insane  right  So  I m picking up my brand spankin  new Focus ZX5 mtx with the new 2 3L PZEV engine later today  Look for a review with my initial impressions in the Focus hatchback section soon Cheers Ken S RIP  95 Contour SE 124 847 miles  Rack was repaired  now running well but 6 years is time to move on  Here s to the good times she gave me Hello to anyone who reads this  This is the first and possibly only review I will write for this website  which by the way  I think is great   I mean the website is great  not that I m only writing one review I have owned my  95 Ford Contour for 6 years and put 100k miles on it in the process  Consequently  I feel that I m qualified to offer a fairly competent review on this car  I ll try to get as much info in as I can  so I apologize if this gets a little long  I purchased my blue 1995 Ford Contour SE in January of  97 with 20k on the odometer  It is equipped with the 2 5 Duratec V6 with atx  power locks  windows  mirrors  cruise control  traction control  4 wheel disc abs brakes  and the sport suspension  Even after 6 years of ownership  I still thoroughly enjoy driving my Contour  I won t lie and say that I ve never had any problems with it  However  the problems have mostly been minor and my Contour has never stranded me anywhere  nor has it ever failed to start  Below I will try to list my likes and dislikes about the car and as many of the repairs as I can remember  I have had the car 6 years so I ll probably forget something Steering Handling Likes   First of all  I love the thick leather wrapped steering wheel  It just feels good in my hands and is very comfortable on any length car trips  The steering action is fairly quick with about 2 75 turns lock to lock and has a nice moderately weighted feel  The handling dynamics of this car are just awesome  My Contour corners predictably and almost completely flat with little nose movement during accel deccel  It feels composed and confident right up to the tires  adhesive limits  The brakes seem very grippy to me  As that I live in a somewhat rural area  I have engaged in interesting maneuvers with deer on several occasions over the years  managing never to hit one thanks to the handling and brakes  Also  as that I live in a Great Lakes region somewhat rural area  I can say that the abs feature has kept me out of many a ditch and minor fender bender during the winter months  Dislikes   In this department  these are mostly minor quibbles  but in the interest of parity I ll list them anyhow  Tire and brake wear seem to be a bit excessive to me  I average about 24 months out of a set of tires  205 60r15  and only about 18 months before I m in need of new brake rotors  although the brake pads last about double that  Due to my semi aggressive driving habits  I can t really fault FoMoCo for the aforementioned problems   Well  I guess in this blame someone else culture  I can fault FoMoCo for making the Contour too fun to drive  Another minor quibble that started at about 110k miles is that occasionally the rear suspension will emit a squawk during quick shifts in load  mostly on quick right turns  I believe I have isolated this problem to the rear anti roll bar bushings  which I will replace when the weather warms up around here  Finally  the communicative steering and taut suspension that make the SE so enjoyable when driven hard lead to a somewhat rough on the back side ride on uneven pavement  not for everyone Engine Transmission  Likes   The 2 5 V6 is just as smooth revving as it has ever been  even at 120k miles  It is not the fastest or most powerful engine in this class  but it has plenty enough to move a light little Contour around quite nicely  This motor seems to run best in the 3500 to 5500 rpm range  though it is not at all horrible of the line  I average about 22 mpg in the winter and 24 mpg in the summer with mixed driving and about 30 mpg on road trips Dislikes   Nothing really on the engine  however the automatic transmission manages to irk me every once and awhile  The main gripe on the atx is that it is at times very sluggish on downshifts  specifically at 25 to 40 mph highway merging speeds  I don t think that there is anything specifically wrong with it other than bad gearing by Ford  which probably had to take fuel economy into account when designing the atx  Other than that it shifts smoothly  though it is definitely due for a fluid change Interior Likes   FoMoCo did their homework here  the control layout ergonomics are excellent  The turn signal wiper stalks are located perfectly  They are completely visible and can be operated with just extended finger tips while leaving the rest of my hands on the wheel   I think this design was copped from VDub  but who cares  it works  The cruise control layout is typical Ford and the buttons have bumps and depressions for intuitive use at night  The large  sweeping instrument pod houses all of the controls surfaces  a drivers side vent  both of the center vent ducts  a handy little bin for change  a clock  and a useful storage bin underneath the radio  The center stack is skewed slightly towards the driver  giving easy reach to the radio and HVAC controls lending an overall cockpit   driver oriented feel to the cabin  All of the window and lock switches as well as oddly enough  the door handles are nicely backlit  The center console is well laid out  contains one cup holder  more on that later  and has useful storage under the armrest  Finally  my favorite interior features are the front seats  For me  at 5 10  and 185 lbs  the driver s seat in the SE is extremely well side bolstered offering great lateral support during cornering  However  it might be a tight fit and or downright uncomfortable for people that are much wider than I am  The seat bottom is also well bolstered and usefully long enough so that it doesn t cut off mid thigh like most any other car I have ever driven does   I m not that tall and I don t have particularly long legs so why is this the case car designers  The headrest is quite useful as it can be adjusted forwards as well as up and down to a point where you can actually rest your head on it while driving  Dislikes   Again  nothing major  just some nitpicky things in the interest of fairness  The cup holders  The original spring loaded  virtually useless for anything but a can  pair of cup holders are long gone  In fairness and surprisingly  they didn t break on their own  My SE s original cup holders came to their untimely demise by way of my friend s foot when he was making an emergency transfer to the back seat to relieve himself in an empty ice tea bottle while we were hopelessly snarled in Pittsburgh s Three Rivers  Stadium parking gridlock  The replacement unit graciously supplied by my friend is a slightly more useful  though just as cheap single unit which I make sure is in the closed position during any current and future trips to Pittsburgh sporting events  The center armrest is for one elbow only  preferably mine  but it doesn t always work that way  A coin flip or scissors paper rock are useful methods for determining armrest custody on longer drives  The driver s window control switches require a minor wrist contortion to operate  though the lock switch is perfectly located to be bumped thus locking the door when exiting the vehicle  which is nice when you actually intend to lock the door  not so nice when you are say  going to pump gas and leave your keys in the ignition  It has happened  it is a bummer  The unlocking mechanism for the gas lid only works in colder weather  During the summer months I must open the trunk and use the auxiliary unlock lever located there  a minor inconvenience  A few rattles emanate from the dash area  most notably from the vents  The vent open close gates seem to be the main culprit  There is also some rattling where the windshield meets the dash which I believe started after the original windshield was replaced Repairs I ll list what I can remember with an approximate mileage and some comments  As earlier stated  I ve had this car for a long time and it is after all  a Ford  so I m probably going to miss something Fuel injectors replaced at around 40k miles  The car was hesitating badly so I took it to my friendly neighborhood Ford garage  They did the work under warranty even though it ran out at 36k  Who says that all Ford service departments are worthless  Not I  Coil Pack replaced at around 75k miles  One of the cylinders was misfiring  This repair cost about  215 New water pump at 90k miles  Anyone familiar with the 2 5 Duratec knows that this is a common occurrence  In my mind  common enough that Ford should have recalled it  but now I m being unrealistic  I did this repair at home with a little help from a friend at a cost of  80 for the pump and  15 50 for the 30 pack of Busch Light New front wheel bearings at 98k miles  The driver s side bearing started to sing  the passenger s side bearing was fine  but it made sense to replace both as a preventative measure  The cost of this repair was around  150 New speedo cable and speed sensor at 110k miles  Either the speedo cable unspooled and trashed the speed sensor  or vice versa  What ever happened  the speedometer and cruise control took a break and the atx went into limp mode which means no overdrive and rough shifting  Though it felt like there was something seriously wrong with the car and that might have been it for old Bessie  but the new parts were only  80 and the repair was simple enough for me to do it myself New intake gasket at 117k miles  This gasket is made of a fibrous material and is either nickel or aluminum plated around the intake openings  The plating eventually wore away and the fibrous material degraded to the point where the many small individual openings became several large openings which in turn caused the engine to idle poorly  I left this repair to the professionals at the Ford garage for a cost of  250 Very early on  before 36k miles  there was something wrong with my gas peddle where on an intermittent basis  I would push it and nothing would happen  I don t remember what exactly was wrong and the problem was fixed under warranty I should note that I m not much of a motorhead  meaning that I don t particularly enjoy working on cars  I do change my own oil and brakes and engage in the occasional minor repair because I enjoy even less giving my money to other people to do something I am capable of doing myself Summary Overall I have been satisfied with the ownership of my Contour  The everyday drivability of it is still very good  All of the accessories including the AC still work great  I ve contemplated getting rid if it more than once  but every newer car I have tried  Focus  Civic  Jetta  I don t like big cars  failed to be sufficiently better enough to justify signing up for 5 more years of payments  At this point  with 120k plus on the odometer  I m traveling into territory where few Fords have gone before  It is almost like a neat little science experiment and sporadic repairs averaging around  300 beat the crap out of a  300 monthly payment  As long as the SE doesn t drop its tranny  or something similarly major  I m going to keep it  PS I don t know if anyone will even read a new review about a 1995 Contour  but I would appreciate and welcome any and all feedback Thanks for looking Ken S 
Neg, I bought a used Contour in 1998  At that time it had 34k miles on it  I wanted the car right when I saw it and wanted it even more after test driving  I had some trouble getting the car to pass MD inspection  Minor stuff  Brakes etc  It took a while to accomplish this  About  300 total cost  The car was great  Others would look at the car in awe and I loved it  The car offered speed and comfort and made me feel like a queen on the road  I was able to keep up with the big dogs on the road  Nice right  The truth about the Contour did not wait too long to rear its ugly head  Six months later  the transmission began to slip  Although it was still covered under warranty  I had to still pay  100  Summer  1999   Tire blow out  The car had to be aligned and I had to buy 4 new tires  The mechanic said that the car was so badly out of line  he wanted to know how it got that way   600 for tires and a serious alignment Summer  2000  The engine sensor came on  It began to make a loud humming noise  I dragged it to the dealer and they told me that it had something to do with emissions  That repair cost me  800  Summer  2000  The car began to make this horrible noise  I was told by a mechanic that it was the Sway bar Another  100  Fall  2000 Winter 2001   Power steering fluid leak  The dealer fixed the leak and charged me  400  5 days later  the car had no power steering and the fluid leak was worse than before  I took the car back and the dealer told me that the engine mounts were bad  Another  400 Fall  2001   Speedometer goes out  The car needed speedometer cables  Another  320    I am dealing with this issue right now Fall  2001   The engine light is coming on and off again  I have not had this one checked out yet  I can t afford it  Ford will charge me  80 for a diagnostic test  Imagine how many times I have paid that Since the summer of 2000 my air conditioner has not worked  I cannot afford to pay for it  Perhaps later  Other problems continue to surface that become more important to repair  The blower switch only operates on the level 3  That gets pretty hot in the winter  I have to ride with the back windows down while the hot air blows into my face Please understand that  I keep all oil changes  For the last year I have been driving 20k per day  Before it was 80k per day  for about a year  I have paid for regular break work  tune ups and transmission checks  tire rotation  I have one cup holder  The car still makes a rattling noise underneath and makes a thumping sound when I am sitting at a light  I can actually feel the thump  And can someone please tell me how is it that the break lights go out so quickly  I would estimate that I have spent close to  if not more  than  4000 on this car since I purchased it  Everyone who knows me is waiting for that next event  I have 18 more payments left  I have decided to wait it out  Once it is paid for  I will be very happy  I am a single parent of 3 and this car is bleeding us  The sad thing about it is Ford does not seem to back their product  Once I get out of this  I will never step foot into another Ford even if the price is right  My kids will know the same when they get older  An entire generation will be anti Ford  
Neg, I bought this car as a second vehicle and used it only for work in another city  It was a GL model with an automatic transmission and 72K miles on it  I paid  5350 for the car and it had a leaking radiator when I bought it  The owner prior to me was trying to sell the car for over  6000 and I was the only offer  The cup holder had long since broken off due to its flimsy design  After the radiator was fixed  for  400  it ran fine for the next six thousand miles  It does seem to have a lot of road noise  though  In freezing weather it also had a distinct knock from the timing belt slapping the top of the timing belt cover  After the engine warmed up and the metal expanded  the knock would stop  Thinking the timing belt was simply stretched  I had it replaced for  300 including new ignition wires and plugs  I never drove it in freezing weather again so I do not know if the new belt corrected the problem Since I moved to a new city I tried to sell the car for the retail price  No takers  no phone calls  I lowered the price to  1000 under retail with still no takers or phone calls  Finally I had to ship the car to my new address  Again I tried to sell the car for  5700  i e  half way between retail and wholesale according to edmunds com  with not one single phone call in the entire Seattle area  I finally offered the car for  5200  which is only  250 above wholesale  I only got three phone calls  The car only had 79K miles on it All during this time the car simply disintegrated  The main seal at the flywheel began to leak prodigiously  The car also had a distinct oil smell in the air conditioning system when I stopped at traffic lights  I had to re seat the valve cover gasket  taken off for the timing belt  because it is a poor design and is easily mangled during installation  The car also began to hesitate severely  I believe this was tied to the  Check Engine  light which began illuminating periodically  Finally the car would not always start  which I believe was a failing starter solenoid I eventually sold it for  5000 but had to split the repair costs with the new owner In conclusion  even when the car ran fine I could not get even close to the book values and finally sold it for  50 above wholesale  In addition the car required over  1700 in repair bills for just 8000 miles of wear  Needless to say I would not recommend the Contour     
Neg, My husband and I leased a 1995 Ford Contour 4D  auto  with air  and power everything  We were pleased with it at first but slowly became disillusioned About a month after we bought it both cup holders were broken  which ever genius decided to put them between the front seats and made of such flimsy plastic ought to be fired  Then the drivers seat broke you couldn t move it forward or backward come to find out the seats had been recalled so they replaced it free of charge   took them almost a month to do it  Then the blower for the heater air would only blow on low kind of cold to ride in in the middle of the winter in New Hampshire  Cost to repair  350 which it stopped working again in about 3 months  Lastly the engine light would come on and off and we took it to Ford they said a wire was loose causing this to happen  Well one day just driving down the road in 1997 the car just stopped running  After all was said and done the engine had seized  No one to this day has been able to explain this to us since it had oil in it was a well maintained car  Cost to repair  3 000  We left the car at the dealership and haven t seen it again I feel sorry for the next sucker to lease buy it br br  
Neg, I purchased a 1995 Ford Contour in August  1997  The car had terrific handling and decent performance from the 2 0 liter 4 banger  For the first 6 months I thought I made a wise decision  First it was the little things both spring activated cupholders broke  No biggie  but not covered under the extended warranty I passed on the service departments offer to replace them for  177  From there it was all downhill the blower motor for the heater stopped working  2 months later I was getting awful clunking groaning noises in the front end  only to find my stabilizer bars and stabilizer links were shot  Wouldn t you know that stabilizer bars ARE covered by the Ford extended warranty  but stabilizer links ARE NOT  To make a long story short during 1998 and early 1999 I was at my dealer 4 times for suspension related problems  and 2 times each for tie rods and front wheel bearings  With my  100 deductible for each visit  plus costs for non covered items  this car was killing me financially The last straw came in May  1999  At 64K miles  exactly 1000 miles after the extended warranty expired  the transmission dropped  I don t care what car you drive  but NO CAR should need a new rebuilt transmission at 4 years 65K miles  My local Ford zone office manager refused to look at the car  and further refused to offer any financial help  He flat out told me the only way they would help me is if a court told them to  Imagine that  Great customer service  huh  I needed to fix the car  but I wasn t going to let Ford touch it  Instead I took the car to an independent transmission shop  FIVE weeks and  1800 later my car was back  Why so long  Turns out it s nearly impossible to get the transmission parts  because everything was on national backorder  Plus my transmission guy informed me this was a  throwaway design  and by far the most difficult transmission job he s done  He said he ll probably never do another Contour Mystique transmission again  and if he did it would probably cost nearly double what he charged me  After arming myself with a written statement from him  as well as finding dozens of owner complaints online pertaining to the transmission  I took another shot at Ford and threatened to litigate through my state s Attorney General s office  Needless to say  Ford would up settling with me nearly 3 months later for  1000  which was better than nothing  By August 1999 I was totally fed up with this pile of rubbish and I traded it in for a 1998 Lumina  which turned out to be a very smart move  And it s not just the  95 s  or the 4 cylinder automatics my cousin owns a 2000 Contour V6 5 speed which has been a disaster from day one  specifically an oil leak that Ford can t seem to fix  As of July  2001  he s in the process of getting Ford to buy the car back under my state s lemon law  To any potential buyer  you would be well advised to shop elsewhere  My advice to current owners  If you have had premature automatic transmission failure and have had to shell out a bunch of money  let Ford know about it  There s no way you should get stuck for expensive transmission work on a throwaway transmission  Ford would never admit it  but I m sure they know this car has been and will be a disaster for them  
Neg, Like everyone else  I waited to see what Ford was going to replace the venerable Tempo Topaz model with  and was surprised to see the new Contour  What s more  as the motoring press praised the new car  especially the upscale Duratec V6 SE model  I thought I should go visit my Ford dealer and see what the fuss was about  as I was in the market for a replacement car  It just so happened the dealer had a Toreador Red SE manual demonstrator model with 600 kilometres fully loaded  except the CD player  The car was an absolute dream to drive  a smooth  powerful  throaty V6  a nice 5 speed  and wonderfully supportive heated leather seats with these nifty  airbag inflaters  that blew up for lumber support  etc  I am in Canada and leather on a minus 30 degree celsius day can really be uncomfortable  The car also had a really nice traction control system and this seemed like the car of my dreams and was a great winter driver  Being 2 months old and  3000 under list price made it a good deal plus it qualified for new car leasing  So I signed a 24 month lease and drove it away late that week Well  for the first month I loved that car  It was a dream to drive and suited my single sport sedan lifestyle  then things started to go wrong  SERIOUS THINGS that no warranty covers you for  One minus 20 morning  I drove the car out of my garage and headed off to work  The car seemed a little sluggish  but I though it was ok as any Canadian will tell you how  stiff and tight  a car becomes on the first cold day of winter  especially newer cars  I was driving about 40 kilometres an hour through a 8 lane intersection when a school bus decided to turn in front of me  I turned clear and hit the breaks and next thing I know I am spinning circles through the intersection  I never had a car do that to me  I didn t hit anything so I pulled out of the intersection at the time noticing my ABS error light was on  When I stopped and got out  I noticed steam and smoke rising of the rear brakes which was strange as one would have thought it would be coming from the front wheels with such a hard braking  My car was fitted with the really nice looking polished spoked alloys from Ford  stupid me reached down and touched the wheel  big mistake as a chunk of skin burned onto the spoke  Man was I fuming as I pulled into a snow covered car park to realize my rear brakes where locked on  the ebrake was off and functioning fine  I called the dealership  and they send down a tow truck  That afternoon they called me and said this was normal to have your brake piston caliper slide pin freeze when you take a warm car out of a garage and into the cold  What a  amp load  They said they parked the car in the garage and an hour later it was fine  So I went to get the car Well  would you believe what happened two weeks later  SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL again with the rear brakes locked  didn t hit anything this time either  This time the dealer had to deal with my wrath as I told them I was not going to pay my lease and they could stick that car where the sun didn t shine  They calmed me down and called me later to say that  they had noticed a few of the new Contours rear disk calipers brakes slide pins were not lubricated properly from the factory  and they had done this to mine and that it was now better then new  So  I went to pick up the car  Two weeks later  brakes were now working great  I noticed that the car was starting to get a slight grind putting the car into first  The clutch was too new to be worn out and I am not a hard driver on clutches  As the week wore on  the grind got worse and worse until the car would no longer engage first gear  hot or cold  Back to the dealer  They called me to say they could not know what was wrong without dropping the transmission  all on a 2 month old car with 1500 kilometres  So they took it apart and said the transmission 1st gear was faulty and needed to be replaced  two weeks later and driving a dealer loaner  my car was still not fixed  The parts were on terminal back order  Mad as could be  I fumed at the service manager and many calls later to Ford customer service in Canada  the dealer had a brand new replacement whole transmission being shipped from the Kansas assembly plant  One week later  I was back in my car but immediately I knew something was not right  The car was all over the road and there was a strange thumping noise that got worse and worse  This time the new transmission was working fine  2 days later back to the shop Turns out the mechanics had not completely tightened all the bolts on the front subframe assembly that  cradles  the transmission and motor  That afternoon I was back in my car  but now it was not driving straight  pulling right  but was tight  5 minutes out of the dealership the engine error light came on but I was too mad and tired  I just drove it home and parked it in the garage  Next morning I got up and went to the garage and thought I could smell gasoline  I got in the car and the smell was unbearable  What I found next was unbelievable  behind the drivers seat the floor pan was protruding up about 4 inches and the rear carpet was soaked in gas  I looked under the car and a pool of gasoline was all over the floor  I poked my head under the car and it was clearly evident the car was hoisted incorrectly by someone at the dealer on the floorpan right along the fuel lines  and one was ruptured  No sales manager has ever heard such a mad customer as I tore up my lease on the phone  A tow truck came and took the car away  Two days later  the dealer had me a brand new identical 1996 Contour SE V6  the only difference was this one was automatic with a CD player  my new girlfriend wanted an automatic and the dealer gave me exactly what I asked for  Same colour  sunroof  leather  etc  etc What I did notice on that 4month old 1st car with barely 2000 kilometres disturbed me  the nice grey leather seats had started to develop creases in the drivers seat leather  The car had spend some time in the cold  but was garaged at night  I would not expect such cosmetic problems to surface for at least a couple years  My current car  a 93 Honda Accord SE has 168 000 kilometres and the leather looks like new  I am not a big guy and the seats are treated with the same leather conditioner I treated the Ford leather with  The dealer took care of the lease and paid the cost differences to keep me happy on the replacement Contour  that car lasted 1 month until on one cold Canadian morning I started the car and the starter motor  stuck    burned out and exploded into several pieces doing quite a bit of damage under the hood  Ford cancelled my lease and I have never put foot in a Ford dealership again Now my story will may not be the typical ownership experience  What I did like about these cars was the Duratec V6 was a dream to drive  when it worked  the fit and finish was OK for a domestic car  the value for money seemed good  the cars were nimble and sporty to drive  the back seat  95  was a bit cramped but I didn t usually have rear passengers and the 96 had rear seats that were  scooped out  to give more rear knee room  The factory sunroofs were nice in that they retracted into the roof fully  The cars were nicely appointed with all the fixings you would expect on a premium SE model  The cars handled really nice  when they were put together properly  with the sportier handling on the SE versions  The 4 wheel disk brakes and the traction control did a nice job of getting the car moving and stopping even with the sport Firestone radials on the icy roads we have here in Canada  I can t say to much about the gas mileage as I never did get to drive the cars enough  The leather seats were really comfortable and very adjustable to any driver  Driver leg room was good  I am a tall guy  and the telescopic tilt steering wheel could be set up nicely  I never got to test the cruise control  steering wheel mounted  on my first car  nor on the second as it never worked on the replacement car  Would I recommend one of these cars  I think you can answer that if you have read this far   I don t know if I had really bad luck but I do know my 4 cylinder  older  Honda is not as powerful or new  but it sure is reliable  Regular maintenance only and no major faults  Some of my problems were dealer technician caused  but the problems should have never been there in the first place  My dad summed it up best   quot never buy a new model car  wait a couple years until the bugs are worked out  or at best  buy your car at the end of its product cycle  even it it doesn t seem as  new  anymore quot  I think he was spot on with the 95 96 Contour SE models br br  
Neg, I have owned two different Ford cars in my life and am not impressed with either one  The first one was a 1987 Ford Escort bought new  It broke down on the freeway less than a month after purchasing it  needed a new engine head and was in the shop for two weeks waiting for parts from Detroit  That was only the beginning of problems with that car  needless to say 10 years later  I am persuaded to give Fords another chance  My husband and I bought a 1995 Ford Contour GL  4 door sedan  It seemed pretty nice at the time  with about 30 000 miles on it  We have it only a couple of weeks when the cup holder breaks  Now this may not seem like a big deal but they are made of  very  flimsy plastic  and I accidentally set my purse on it which totally snapped it off  The cost to replace it  How about  68  The cupholder is still broken to this day Next the fan switch stops working  Well  it works  but only on the lowest speed  If you turn it up  it turns off completely  Visualize us desperate for some a c with our faces pressed close to the dash vents The rear doors start making this horrible screeching noise when they re opened  WD 40 has no effect Then the engine light starts coming on and off randomly  We take it to several different places  nothing is found to be wrong  The latest is that the transmission sounds like it s starting to slip  I dread the thought of a  1500 tranny repair cost  All I want to do is unload this car  but unfortunately Fords do not hold their values that well  and we probably could barely sell it for what we owe on the loan I will never buy another Ford again  I know some people swear by them  but I have owned many Honda  Toyotas  and Nissans that served me much better and I think I ll go back to what I can depend on br br  
Neg, I bought the Contour in November  1975 as a second car  About a month after I drove it off the lot I started hearing a rubbing noise from the front  The problem turned out to be a front stabilizer bar bushing  Unfortunately the bushing is  pressed  onto the bar at the factory  so you have to buy the entire assembly  another Ford  better idea profit maximization at the expense of the customer  The extended warranty refused to cover the repair  so I was out approximately  185 A short time later  my  check engine  light kept coming on  The problem was diagnosed as a defective exhaust gas sensor  Once again  the extended warranty company wouldn t pay for the estimated  200 repair since it was not a covered component  Ford s emission warranty likewise passed the buck despite the fact that the sensor is part of the emission control system In the summer of  97  the engine cooling fan fried and the blower switch to the heater air conditioner stuck in the  low  position  After spending almost  500 to replace the cooling fan and fuse assembly  I just received a recall notice from Ford almost 4 years later  In addition  this car chews tire  suspension  and brake components with reckless abandon  I ve been through two sets of rotors both front and rear  three sets of disc brake pads  and two sets of tires  The car has also developed a head gasket leak and drips oil on the exhaust manifold  creating a most unpleasant smell when the car is warm Although this is a trifling problem by comparison with the other woes I ve had with the Contour  the ergonomics are poor  The power door lock button is located so close to the armrest that I ve locked the keys in the car on a few occasions getting out  and I might be the luckiest Contour owner on the face of the earth because the cheap plastic springloaded cupholders in my car still haven t broken yet  imagine that  This is the 11th Ford product I ve owned since 1978 and the most trouble prone of the lot  It will definitely be my last  
Neg, I purchased this vehicle after driving my  86 Toyota Celica to the ground delivering pizzas  I was then done with that job and wanted a decent car to last me a long time  I found a two year old Contour for  9000 and decided it was a good deal and got it And in fact it hasn t been a horrible car  Despite a few recalls  it keeps running with minimal maintenance  I think the worst problem I had was that the tires needed replaced  But there is always a feeling owning this car that it is going to break down any time  The engine is loud  the V4  and doesn t have a very smooth sound  There were some knocking too that had nothing to do with the type of gas I was giving it  I had also spoken too other people who had owned the car  and their opinion was more negative than mine  They said that the car was plagued with recalls and was not very reliable The drive was decent  nothing too notable  Compared to the Celica I had  it rode up high  The V4 didn t have a lot of muscle  despite the fact that my Contour had a manual transmission  I am certainly glad I didn t get the Automatic All in all  it was a good car while we owned it  We traded it in after it had 65 000 miles  I didn t want to press my luck any further  Speaking of trade in  I didn t get much for it   2k for a 1995  I know I could have gotten more but not much more  But overall  there are much better choices out there  I traded it in for Toyota and I am very happy with that  The  quot comfort quot  level  i e  the confidence in the car  owning the Toyota is much higher than it was for the Ford If you can find a good deal on a Contour  a really good deal  go for it  but otherwise keep searching br br  
Neg, I have had nothing but problems with my contour since I bought it  Within two weeks the cup holders broke  They are ade from flimsy plastic located in between the front seats  Next the driver s side head rest broke  280 to fix  So needles to say I don t have a headrest in my car that is functional Numerous factory recalls and  as Ford terms them  extended warranties  These include front strut springs  both of mine failed within a week of one another  Others include under hood wiring  Heater blower switch and heater fuse  These are just the ones that I have had problems with I recently found that this car has a 30  fail rate in transmissions above 75 000 miles  Are you kidding me almost 1 in every 3  I know because Ford uses a type CE4E transmission  that they have known is problematic since they started using it in 1994  If your transmission goes it ll run about  2000 to  3500 to fix  rebulid or replace My second issue is with Ford itself  I purchased my car and purchased the 100 000 mile power train warranty  It was 100 000 miles or 56 months  Get this my transmission failed 1 day after the warranty  56 Mos  was up My advice is if you own one  rid yourself of this car fast  If your going to buy one don t  And always ask a Ford dealership what kind of transmission is in the car  If they say CE4E  then laugh and walk away  
Neg, I purchased a  95 Contour GL in Aug of  97 for  9000  It had only 29k kiles on it  It had the 2 0 four cylinder and 5 speed  Before the warranty expired  the deal replaced free the rack and pinion steering syste  the A C blower  condenser and evaporator  and did some recall service  It was already a lemon under warranty  The cup holder broke kwik  the headlight plastic lense turned dark yellow  deminishing light output  The alternator failed  I had to replace the battery twice  and the alternator was very very hard to remove and replace  My mechanic friend replaced it and ins not a good sign when a pro complains about your car  The throw out bearing in the tranny was about to go out at 63k miles when I sold the car in Feb of  00  The car had bad resale value The only good thing was that my MPG never dropped below 23MPG in the city  I routinly averaged 30 31mpg on long out of town trips  and the seats and fron leg room was comfortable   I m 6 00  with long arms and legs The back seat was very small  Everyone complained  Handling was bad too  I replaced the tires with some Michelin Roadhandler Sports from Sears and made a huge differance in cornering  Excellent tires can make up for a bad car  It has horrible breaks  They fade very quickly  If you want a cheap car that breaks a lot and has no resale value buy the Contour  If you want a cheap car that is dependable and has decent resale value  buy a 95 altima from nissan  
Neg, This is an update on the report I wrote a while ago on my car  I currently have 108 000kms on the odometer and have had some more serious problems since the last review  I still maintain my opinions about the awesome driving dynamics of the car and the powerful and delightfully high revving V6 engine that powers it  Every time I drive the car  it never ceases to amaze me and amuse me  I absolutely love the engine  It sounds so great and is more than adequate to move the car along  I still waste much more gas than I should  but I can t resist the beautiful music the motor makes when it reaches top RPMs and the corresponding pull it develops  I recently had the brake pads and rotors replaced since the originals were warped and had hairline cracks developing due to age   but hey  106 000 kms out of the original brakes is really something   especially considering that this car has been DRIVEN  The car has 4 wheel discs  with ABS  so the brake job was rather expensive  but obviously necessary  Now for the bad aspects  The waterpump and its gasket blew in the summer  some ABS regulator blew at the same time  the low speed fan and some other components broke 2 days after I got the car back from the aforementioned repairs  That alone would have cost me around  4000CDN if it weren t for the extended warranty  The splash shield has been rattling around badly and actually fell off after the fan was replaced since it wasn t reattatched properly  I ve had some dash lights burn out and I have also had a tie rod break somehow   don t ask   I don t know The car is in good repair right now except for the resonator which is bad just due to age  but the rest of the exhaust system is looking all right  The glitches have finally been sorted out   it s about time  However the time has come to sell the car and get something new  A VW Golf GLS 1 8T is a definite prospect  No matter what kind of car I get next  even if it were a Ferrari  I will miss the Contour  It hasn t been the most reliable car  by any means  but it has definitely been a great driving car  it still puts an ear to ear grin on my face when I drive it  High performance out of a sleeper sedan  I love it  My ownership has definitely been characterized with a love hate type relationship with this car  I love it when it works  I hate it when it s in the shop  As for the bad resonator  I think I ll leave it be  because if I fix it something else is bound to go wrong  I can live with a slightly louder than normal exhaust system     
Neg, The Ford Mustang  My husband s dream car   quot I really want this car quot  he says   Yes  I m sure you do  So I  dutiful spousal unit that I am  re arranged our family budget to include the extra insurance and payment that would trail the joyous ownership of such a car  And so it was that he left one day and came home with a flashy hunter green Mustang   Such a pretty car  Well  it was pretty until this one certain woman my husband is married to accidentally ripped off the driver side door  Yes  we are still married   quot After all what is insurance for quot  says he  Indeed Unlike many men with new vehicular toys  my husband actually tried to encourage me to drive his car  He wanted me to like it as much as he did so he could justify the expense and claim that I used it as much as he did  However  at the time I had my own broomstick  a Ford F150 4x4 Flareside truck  I had no interest in his puny car  but I did drive it once in a while when he stole my truck  and following is a summary of that I think of this vehicle The FORD MUSTANG GT comes with a very powerful V 8 engine  manual 5 speed transmission  you can get them in automatic  however you will get less mpg  power doors seats mirrors  dual airbags  dual lighted vanity mirrors  rear shoulder harnesses  driver and passenger bucket seats  fully adjustable power driver side seat  air conditioning  and lots of other nifty little extra features that any self respecting car should sport  The glove compartment in the front passenger side contains the trunk popping mechanism  and the center console has a nice divided change holder and cassette cd holder thingie  Everything is pretty much within arms reach while driving  In spite of the positive points and pure flash value  I did not enjoy driving this vehicle and actually avoided it  I found that the bucket seats put me far too close to the ground  and I felt like I was in the cockpit of an airplane trying to peek out over the dashboard   Yeah  as if I have ever sat in the cockpit of an airplane  I felt unsafe and nervous because I could not see very well behind me  around me  or even in front of me  The tiny mirrors did not help matters much at all  Had we installed a  quot wink quot  mirror  I probably would have felt better about driving the car  but we never got around to that because my husband liked it just fine  he is much taller  though  and does not find his nose hitting the dashboard  and he mainly drove it The 5 speed manual transmission shifted fairly smoothly  but the gears seemed to be very close together  This was not a problem for me  because I have been driving manual transmissions since I was 14  My dad used to own a racetrack  and I even drove his old 3 speed on the column H pattern trash truck for him  Most young people these days have never even heard of one of those  But those close gears could make missing a gear easy for inexperienced manual transmission drivers  so I would practice on an old VW bug before driving this type of car if you have not had a lot of practice with clutches and gears  The gas mileage we got was about 18 mpg in the city  and a bit more on the freeway  Not good  but not horrendous either  Additionally  insurance rates are pretty high for this type of vehicle  as you can well expect  My insurance company  USAA  put out a book which rated the safety level of most of the popular cars  and the MUSTANG did not score very well in any category  despite the dual airbags and anti lock brakes  I am sure there are many reasons for this  but the fact that the vehicle is capable of great speed probably contributes While the leg area was very ample and could easily accommodate my husband s 6 3 frame  the seats were very narrow  My chunky lil bootie just barely fit comfortably  A very large hipped person would not be able to fit in those seats  and if they did manage to squeeze in they would have the seatbelt latch digging into their outer thighs  Additionally  the back area is so small that only very small adults or children 12 and under can really ride in any semblance of comfort  My son had to lay down in back when he rode in this car  Needless to say when my husband and I went out with our oldest son  I got stuck hunkering in the back  After a while  I just stayed home Acceleration is  needless to say  very fast  This car reminded me of a song by the band ALABAMA called  quot I m in a Hurry quot  A line in the song goes   quot my car s not new but it ll zero to sixty in 5 2 quot  While that figure may not be accurate for the MUSTANG  it probably comes close  I found myself speeding every single time I drove this car  because you simply do not realize how fast you are going  I had to constantly be on my guard  One time I realized I was doing 80 mph in a 45 zone  YIKES  Another thing don t buy these cars in red  especially if you have a lead foot  unless you set up a separate speeding ticket fund  They are cop magnets for some reason  The dark  inconspicuous color of my husband s car probably saved us both from numerous tickets The Ford Mustang corners like there is no tomorrow  The low center of gravity and wide wheel base helps the car hug the road on even the sharpest corners  Again  however  this can lead to disaster when drivers become over confident and misjudge either the sharpness of the corner  their own ability to control the car  or both  Follow the suggested speed limits on corners at all times  especially in this car  because it is easy to loose control when you go 90 mph on a 20 mph curve  I would recommend this car to responsible singles and couples  It is not  in my opinion  a good family vehicle  even though a car seat would fit in the back  I would not transport my baby in this car if I had another choice  There are too many safer cars on the market  This car is NOT  in ANY WAY  suitable for teenagers or inexperienced drivers  The combination of hormones  inexperience  and speed are often deadly  Likewise  it is not suitable for very elderly drivers who may suffer from vision impairment  slow reflexes  or distance judgment  or ANY driver with such impairment for that matter  Shortly after I ripped the driver side door off  Don t EVEN ask how  HAHHAHA  we traded the Mustang and a deathtrap Plymouth Grand Voyager  see my review on that hay wagon  toward a 2000 Ford Excursion  and I sold my truck  We had 3 cars  and not a single one of them was a safe  large  reliable vehicle for a family of 6  I felt bad about my husband s dream car flying the coop  but I had to relinquish my truck as well  so my sympathy level diminished rapidly  The needs of the many definitely outweighed the need of the few  Anyone know how to kill a Vulcan for coining that phrase br br  
Neg, After we got all our money back from our 1995 Mustang Convertible due to the Lemon Law in Florida  we used that money to order another new Mustang but instead of the white color we ordered the Laserred with the camel color top and interior  We were disappointed in the 1995 Mustang when the engine blew after owning it 8 days  it was brand new  and then the transmission went later We were thrilled with the car  6 cylinder  We drove it here  we drove it there  It s seemed like a nice car but typical Mustang  The pick up was sluggish  The seats were low and not comfortable  The cup holder was situated over the button that makes the top go up and down and the water dripped onto the button and I was waiting for it to short out some day On a hot day in south Florida with the top up  the a c didn t cool like it should because the sun beats down on the canvas top and there isn t any insulation so all the heat enters the car  There s no room in the back seat for people to sit  it is only good for either babies or double amputees  The trunk is small  The stereo average The gas mileage good  The convertible is easy to open and close  Our problem began about 12 months after owning the car  There was a vibration and we kept taking it in and they told us it needed to be aligned so they aligned it and it still vibrated  After months of going back and forth with the vibration and  600 later for new tires  they told us the tires were the cause and we purchased new tires  I told them that I had the torque converter and transmission and engine go bad in our other Mustang but they told me it wasn t any of that  it was in my mine  By that time I was out of my mind  When the service manager opened his drawer I saw a notice for Mustang torque converters and I asked him about that and he fessed up  The torque converters are bad and they have a quiet recall because they don t have enough torque converters to replace on all the Mustangs and they could only fix the ones with SEVERE problems  Again  this is the second Mustang with BIG problems  We had the car for 20 months and I wasn t about to go the Lemon Law route so I told my son we would buy the 2000 GT Convertible and trade this problem vehicle in  I had read that the GT didn t have problems with the torque converter  WRONG AGAIN  When will I learn  See my review on the 1995  amp  2000 Mustangs  Same problems different years  The Mustang is neat to look at  but a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT  If only Ford would build a good reliable Mustang I would buy one despite their MAJOR FLAWS but they don t  We now own an Explorer Sports Trac  Let s see how that goes br br  
Neg, I bought this vehicle in October of 1999 mostly because I was coerced and bullied by the salesmen at my local Ford dealership  I liked the looks of it  but  being my first new car  was extremely naive in how to go about purchasing one  I had looked at a few other cars  such as the Sebring  the Dodge Stealth  used  the Camaro  and the Avenger but never had the chance to really think about it and decide which one I liked best  Anyway  since then I have decided that I would never buy another Ford Mustang and would not recommend it to anyone  First of all  the pickup on the V6 engine is lame at best for such a  quot sports quot  car  Secondly  the interior is the most poorly designed that I think I have ever seen  Let s start with something as trivial as the cup holders  They have situated it so that the larger of the two holders is furthest back  but it is so large the the average cup inevitably spills every time  The smaller of the two holders holds the cup comfortably  however it is so close to the stick shift that it makes it impossible to put a drink in it without knocking it over in the process of shifting gears  Then  the seatbelt holder sticks out so far that as soon as you sit in the seat  it hits the side of the door   1 locking the door  and  2  creating a dent in the plastic on the door  The legroom is cramped and tall people have a very difficult time riding in my car  The high beam device turns on opposite  you have to push it away from you rather than pulling it towards you like a normal car  to every other car that I have ever driven  which is frustrating when you try to pull it towards you out of habit  The trunk is pretty good sized  but don t try to put a large suitcase in there  because the distance between the edge and the top is so small it prevents you from being able to get it in there  I ll admit that it s a pretty car  but that s about it     
Neg, After ten years I gave into my teenage cravings for a Mustang  The adult in me limited myself to the V6  stupid adult  The V6 with the sport package looks fabulous  and in spite of being one of the most common cars on the roads  gets complements from some  those who can t tell it s not a GT I m sure  Unfortunately that s all the good that can be said for it It is very cramped  Anyone over 6 feet tall  or who carries more than one passenger  or who travels and needs to carry a lot of stuff should just pass on this car  The trunk  like the back seat  is almost to small to be useful  Much of the interior is not very well though out  For example  you can only put a drink in one of the two cupholders  as one interferes with the stick shift  I can t believe they let it go like that Performance is uninspiring  Granted it is the V6  but my 94 Probe  4 cylinder  was much more fun to drive  They need a new category for the Mustang V6  It s not a compact  and it s not a sports car    It s too big on the outside to be call a compact I m sure  It s worth noting that the car looks much bigger from the outside  than it feels on the inside  Kind of like Dr  Who s Tartus in reverse I wil admit that the car is a pretty good bargain  and I picked mine up as a year end clearout  so I don t feel cheated  But this is my last Mustang br br  
Neg, I rented one from Hertz while on a business trip since they were out of the reserved type and was looking forward to driving it since I had heard people rave about it I was quite disappointed actually  the engine was loud  this could be a plus for some it had a rough idle and was generally unrefined though powerful it did seem to smooth out over 60 mph somewhat  the interior layout  amp  dash were ugly and badly designed it actually looked cheap   i strongly felt i could have designed a better dash   my tercel had a nicer  cleaner  smoother layout  the power seat controls were difficult to reach  i m 6 1 quot and i had to actually get out of the car to properly adjust my seat This is not the kind of car i would like to own ever I guess I was  spoiled  after riding the Saab 9 5 which is a lot more expensive  you get what you pay for i suppose I find it hard to believe that a nicer sporty car cannot be built at this price range Take one for a test drive and see for yourself br br  
Neg, The first time I saw the Silver 1998 Ford Mustang  I new I  HAD  to have it  Needless to say  I drove it home that day  I bought the vehicle  because it had the sporty appearance that I was looking for and it really was not that expensive  compared to a lot of other sports cars  What I love about this car  aside from its looks  is the fact that the power is there when you need it  It gets really good gas mileage and of course  my kids love the fact that there is a horse on the steering wheel  The only downfall is that the back seat is not very roomy  Right now my kids are small and there is plenty of room for them  but I cannot see an adult being too comfortable sitting in the back seat  The car handles really well and is easy to maneuver in and out of traffic  I recommend this car to anyone in the market for a car with a sporty look at a decent price  By the way  the electric adjustment on the drive s seat is a must     
Neg, I bought a 1998 Mustang 6 cylinder in May of 1998  The car started out to be great  but turned into a  quot sour fruit quot  shortly after When I originally bought the vehicle  I tinted the windows and put an alarm on it only to find that the power window module was poking holes in the tint  After I had a couple of car full s of people  5  I noticed that the back shocks were not holding up the body of the car as well as it should  Not only that  but at 18 000 miles  the tires became bald  Also  after I was able to get used to the car  I noticed that the seat belts were not retracting properly  therefore leaving the seat belts hanging out of the car when I closed the door  The motor engine has been good so far except for this summer when the starter  alternator  and the battery gave out  All of the problems I had with the car SHOULD have been covered under warranty  But when I took the car in however they either said go to the manufacturer  tires  or we will TRY to fix it  in which case  most of the time it did not get fixed  I have been told by many people that you either love your Mustang or you hate it  I see it this way  If you want something different from everybody else on the road and something that can handle normal car  quot responsibilities quot  then do not buy the Ford Mustang  If you do have money to burn and you do not expect much from your car  then the Mustang is right for you br br  
Neg, This is a beautiful car  Great styling  very comfy  The convertible top is almost childlike in it s ease of operation and the Mach 460 sound system is the best stock system that I have heard Now  for the bad news  The Mustang lacks quite alot in the performance area  To be the flagship sports car in Ford s line of autos it is sadly disappointing  I bought the Mustang after owning a 1998 Chevy Z 28 with a 6 speed transmission  Supposedly these two are  quot comparable cars quot  Not Quite  Though the Mustang s suspension rides nicer and sits better on the ground to allow for better cornering  in the long run that doesn t remotely make up for the difference in power  The Ford s 4 6 liter engine  though good on gas  lacks the gusto of the 5 7 LS1 in the Camaro  If you are in the market for a great looking  comfortable ride in a car that has a sports car imagine but passes up most gas stations due to the lack of raw power this is the car for you  But if you want an all out beast and want to get your money s worth in a so called sports car  I suggest you pass up the Ford dealership and head for the nearest Bowtie shop br br  
Neg, October 1997 I decide to get myself a new car  After driving heavy SUVs or Sedan  I thought I could switch to a smaller  more maneuverable  more economical and quicker car Well after little shopping around  big mistake  I bought a Ford Mustang because they gave me a great deal and more money than anybody else for my old 4WD  I first thought it was the best car because I had been used to drive older cars  The Mustang was new  clean  runned smoothly and quiet  and smelled NEW Then  I quickly realized that it was NOT a SPORT car at all  It certainly is a coupe with little room inside but the engine and chassis are far from being Sport car elements  With a too big and heavy 3 8l engine they only get 155 HP which is ridiculous above all considering the very heavy weight of the car  Too heavy to be a real sport car  This car needs a smaller and more efficient engine with at least 30 more horse powers and lighter material to lose about 500 lbs  Then you d start getting interesting results  Might also need a 6 speed instead of a 5  I definitely recommend choosing a stick if you want some kind of sensation so that you can go up in the RPMs and get a little power  The car max speed is alo limited electronically and usually varies between 115 and 120  Mine never went above 115mph  but considering how dangerous highways are and how many cops are out there  it is more tha enough  The competition just left the Mustang behind in the dust as far as performance is concerned and handling probably too  This car chassis is 10 or 15 year old  suspensions are more comfort than sport  and the weight also alters the handling  The camaro V6 has a lot more horse power  The Golf GTI is quicker  The Mitsubichi Eclipse is quicker and more economical  handles better  A great buy Inside the car is pretty nice and well organized  It is comfortable for a sport car unless you are above 6 2 quot  Then leg room is an issue in the front seats  IN the back  forget about the seats  you could barely fit a 14 year old  Might as well be no seats and more leg room in the front like in a MR2  My friend who is 6 5 quot  actually fits comfortably in his MR2  Access to the rear seats is not easy either  The base Mustang model comes with a lot of features  all power  alloy wheels  rear defrost  remote entry  CD player  Big mistake form Ford  not including floor mats  How cheap A few positive things about my 98 Mustang IT is economical  never had to fix anything  well the CD player went dead but the warranty took care of that  Gas mileage is great for a big V6  Basically  an oil change every 4 or 5 k miles it seems reliable  Except for that CD player  no visit to the mechanic Quality improved  The plastics used inside are not bad at all for a cheap car and it is assembled pretty well  No noises in the car even after 36k miles  Tires went slick fast though Quiet ride  for a sport car  it rides smoothly and is quiet  The seats are also more comfortable than average The price is low and the car looks good  it has a lot of standard features for the price including CD player  However  it DOES NOT DELIVER as a sport car  Just buy it for the looks or if you HAVE to own a Mustang Overall  it is a good ride but not a sporty one  At red lights  I could not even try to compete with most sedans like the ACCORD v6  MAzda V6  some pick ups  For Sport  if you have to own a MUSTANG  GET THE AMZINGLY POWERFUL V8 but then be careful because the chassis  suspensions will not tolerate driving mistakes  They are not good enough for that power plant and on the rain better stay under 2000 rpm  My husband bought a V8 after we sold the V6 and he loved the sensations I guess the Mustang v6 is a good car for a young driver as it is cheap and is not too quick I would not recommend it otherwise br br  
Neg, Three years ago  I finally could offer my own brand new car  Coming from France  I wanted something I could not find there  something typically American  I looked at the new Sebring and found it a little expensive and very heavy  I was not that impressed  plus it looked like a car designed for older people  So I thought I would go for the Myth  The So worldwide famous Ford Mustang  I Was so excited by the purchase experience and the fact I was going to own a brand new car that I did not realize how bad this car was for me After a few months of driving  the excitement of driving a new Mustang was gone and reality struck  The Ford Mustang cannot seat four people  so why bother with the rear seats  Unless you put kids in the back  kids up to 11 or 12 top  my 11 YEAR old  a little tall for her age  was not even comfortable in the rear seat  Well  the truth is the Mustang can barely seat two if the front occupants are big or just tall  I am 6 2 quot  and over 200 lbs  I drove   I sold that car after 2 years even though it was paid off with the steering wheel sitting on my lap  my left knee stuck between the turning signal and the door  My legs would start hurting after a couple of hours of driving due to the lack of leg room and the uncomfortable seats which were also too short too support the top part of my legs  A tall person would also find the passenger side uncomfortable because of the seat itself and the lack of  quot knee quot  room  the dashboard above the glove compartment is extended toward the passenger to an extreme  This significantly affects the leg room which would otherwise be decent for this type of car Next disappointent was the engine  or more exactly its lack of power for such an heavy car which brings me to the next flaw of this SO CALLED sport car  it weight  How can you call that a sport car  155 horse power that do not deliver in spite of a pretty big engine 3 8liter  A European or Japanese car equipped with such a big engine would deliver twice that power and be a lot more efficient  Or they would only need a 2 0l to 2 4l to deliver 155 hp on a car 40  lighter  A sport car should not be that heavy  the weight affects the handling and decrease pick up  I had small pick ups totally blew me away at red lights  How embarrassing  The Camaro six cylinder does better wit a more powerful engine I love the shape of the Mustang even though it is too high and massive for a sport car  The quality is better than i expected and it is loaded  What a value  can t beat the price for a car equipped with CD player  power doors  mirrors  remote entry  rear defrost  etc  However  I think all cars should come with floor mats  it is ridiculous to make them an option Another plus for this compact 2 door not so sporty car is the size of the trunk  HOWEVER  the opening is tiny so don t even think about loading any big items  The ride is acceptable at low speed  but becomes unsafe when taking curves a little fast or driving on a rainy day  This car rear end wants to get ahead of the front end  So get used to it before playing the race car driver If you want the sport look at a low price without the power  it might be the car for you if you are single  No family in that car br br  
Neg, I bought a 1998 Mustang because I fell in love with the car the moment I stepped foot on the car lot  I bought it the same day I took the test drive  The car is beautiful and amazingly comfortable  Although Ford has great servicing for these cars  I am disappointed that within six months of owning the car I am having trouble with the engine  squealing tires  loose windows and creaks of every possible kind  I take great care of my vehicle and do not abuse it in any way  The problems started with a horrible clicking noise in my left front tire and seems to escalate to additional problems on a daily basis  It seems that I spend much more time at the dealership than I should  especially with such a new car  By the way  they do find something every time I go  I am not imagining things  I have often heard rumors about Ford cars  but chose to ignore them  It seems they might not be rumors after all     
Neg, I ve owned 87 cars in my life  some new  some very old  but this Mustang takes the cake  Over 80 000 miles and NO repairs  NO problems  Heck  I haven t even had to change the brakes yet  Whoop s  my wife just reminded me  we had a turn signal bulb that went out  Total repair costs in 80 000 miles  2 95  AMAZING  Plus we get 25 27 MPG around town and on a recent 1600 mile trip averaged 32 MPG on the road  And that was as she purred along at 85MPH for a good portion of the trip  The seats are comfortable  yet offer enough support that even on our long trip  we never felt fatigued  The 3 8L V6 is smooth and responsive And this being said from a guy who drove BigBlocks in the 70 s with ample power   She will sqaull the tires from a dead stop  and when my wife isn t with me  I just love blowing the doors off the Hondas  Acuras  Toyotas  and what ever other piece of Jap Crap is cruising the local boulivard   Even us grey hairs like to have some fun now and then  My boss has the same year Camaro V6  and I can out run it  out gas mileage it  out handle it  and I don t have to fix it once a month  and all for only  4000 LESS than he paid  Then there is the obvious  It s looks  Bright Red  on one of the best body styles of the 90 s  This car is just flat beautiful  It looks mean just sitting there  buy is sleek enough to slice through the air with outstanding aerodynamics  Sure the back seat isn t that big  but it holds my 2 teenagers  who would much rather be driving her  with no problems  though I m sure they wouldn t want to take a long trip back there  And yes the trunk is small  but it IS a sports car  not a sedan  If you need more back seat  or trunk room than what this car has  then you shouldn t be driving a sports car  I highly recommend this car to ANYONE looking for a car with some flare  great fuel mileage Performance  EXTREME RELIABILITY and less expensive than anything in it s class  MUSTANGS RULE  
Neg, I bought my 1998 V6 Ford Mustang brand new at the end of 1998  Despite poor salesmanship the car seemed a good looker  had reasonable pace and I had every reason to believe in Ford reliability so I bought it  At around  17 000 I believed and still do I got a bargain First and foremost with 40 000 miles completed this car has never given me any maintenance headaches  touch wood  In this respect it has filled my paramount expectation  Of course the first Mustang question is V6 or the GT  Well coming from Europe 3 8L seemed like a huge engine and the extra cash for the GT a little unnecessary  Three years later and 40 000 on the clock I regret my decision to plump for the V6  Its not that 3 8L V6 lacks pace it just does not compete at that sports car level I imagine 4 6L makes all the difference in performance The interior has been forgiving of my carelessness  with a little maintenance the upholstery and dash are in almost perfect shape  Seats are not luxurious but none the less comfortable  The front seat is electronically controlled while the passanger seat is a lever Outside  this car is a looker bought in 1998 I still get complements on its sleek silver exterior  Get the spoiler However I have become concerned about how my Mustang handles in the rain  coming out of the car wash and on one occasion the Texas snow  The car has a tendency to fish tail especially when building up from a complete stop  I think the reviewed 1999 25th anniversary models compactness may take on board this concern  That salesman told me a lie about them changing the design Overall  this is a solid reliable car  I have maintained it well and therefore expect it to run at least another 40 000 miles  I very rarely have more than two people in my car but on the occasion I do it s less than comfortable in the back  neither does the Mustang bless us with a lot of trunk space  Bottom line   this is no family car  
Neg, I am not a car expert  but I know I waited many years before acquiring what I thought was my dream car  In January  2000  I bought a 1998 Mustang convertible 6 cylinder automatic  No doubt  this pony was beautiful to look at with its bright Atlantic blue paint and white top  But in the department of performance  the car was lacking  Many Mustang fanatics told me I got what I paid for as they swear by the GT engine  I was disappointed especially after driving three rental cars after the Mustang was rear ended and in the shop for repairs  All three of the rentals were equipped with 6 cylinder engines and all out performed the Mustang 6 cylinder   Rentals were a 99 Chrysler Sebring  a 99 Dodge Intrepid  and a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am  I just expected more from the Mustang than Ford delivered I understand Ford has improved the performance of the 99  6 cylinder Mustangs  but I am waiting delivery on a 2000 Mustang GT convertible  Now I will sit back and let the Mustang fanatice criticize me for choosing an automatic 8 cylinder over the standard transmission   br br  
Neg, Unlike the fellow who reviewed an 84 Crown Vic by owning an 86 model  I can give you the real story  First  the car has a good ride on dirt roads and a huge  ten dead body sized trunk  It also has a bunch of crush space to absorb collision impact  The lack of road feel is a positive thing  both in rural areas and over city potholes They look alike on the outside  but the 1984 model has demonstable shortcomings  My experience is based upon getting to borrow my mom s 1986 Crown Victoria  which is a wonderful car except for the front bench seat  and subsequently buying a 1984 Crown Victoria  thinking that I would be getting the same critter  The earlier car is a boat anchor that has occupied space in the yard for the weedeater to trim around  while the 1986 model has soldiered on trouble free The 1984 has an igniton module that simply quits going down the road  It also has the aggravating characteristic of testing out all right on the test bench  but not working in the car  The 86 model has a different system  The fuel injector is a throttle body type in the 84  and a tuned port type in the 86  which is far superior in driveability and economy  The seat back broke inside  and it won t stay upright  The seat has absolutely no lumbar support  which is verified by driving mom s 86 model  which is not broken  Also  the car has 14  wheels  which makes finding used tires large enough difficult My car was really cheap  with no body damage and only 80 000 actual miles  but it was no bargain because it s ignition and fuel injection systems were badly designed  I have only gotten a few miles out of it while mom has gotten another 50 000 with hers without a hitch  Her car gets pretty good mileage  has 15  wheels  and has better acceleration  Of course  mine has no acceleration most of the time  execept behind a tow truck Don t buy an 84  Get an 86  which is a fishing car beyond comparison  if you want cheap transportation with room for your XXL buddies and all their gear  
Neg, The company that I work at owns a 1991 Lariat  that lives up to Ford s   quot Fix Or Repair Daily quot  reputation The pros  although limited are as follows  The 460 CI engine is full of torque  and pulls trailers up relatively steep inclines 6  grade  easily  The cab is huge  and easily sits five people  six if they like each other  The rear sliding window is a nice addition  and the air conditioning is excellent  This truck looks nice on the outside  and the paint is in fairly good condition  although off white was not a good choice Now for the cons  this truck has 300 000 miles on it  and has had three engines  and seven transmissions put into it  As of now  the seventh transmission is in bad shape  and will probably have to be replaced in six months or less  This is to be expected  being a heavily used work truck  but I believe we should be getting a bit more mileage out of each component  since not many people drive the truck and it is usually babied  The seats are the most uncomfortable I ve ever sat in  the contouring is all wrong  and you sit way too far into the seats  The headlight control between bright and dim is on the floor  which is sometimes hard to find  especially at night  when it is most needed  The tailgate had plastic elements that became heavily stressed and broke  so the only way to open the tailgate was with two people and two screw drivers  The exhaust mounting is hardly up to par  and two have broken  Manual hubs are ridiculous  especially in a truck manufactured after 1990  Minor mechanical failures  and electrical glitches have put this truck in the shop for much more than routine maintenance  Gas mileage with the 460 is absurd  averaging 10 13  the two gas tanks this truck sports are absolutely necessity  and before going anywhere  you have to make sure they are full We recently put a service bed on it  and replaced the entire ignition system  The company is purchasing a new truck near in the future  and I won t be the least bit surprised when it isn t a Ford br br  
Neg, I got my 97 Escort brand new in 1997  I was in the market for something that would be easy to maintain  get me around good distances comfortably and be a good first car  I initially was looking at used cars  but decided that a new car would be good  since the warranty was a big bonus to me  having little knowledge about cars and car maintenance Within 15 000 km  I started having to double clutch to get into reverse about half the time  Yes  it s a manual transmission  and double clutching is when you take the car  which is not moving  from whatever gear you were in  into neutral  lift the clutch  depress the clutch again  and then engage it into reverse  I took it into the dealership I bought it from and asked them to look into it during some other routine maintenance  oil and air filter change  They only did the oil change that day  When I picked it up  I inquired about the air filter and the double clutching  They said they d have someone out to where my car was parked to show me how to use my transmission   and install the air filter  Well  the assistant service manager  I think that was his title  came out  He was very condescending  until he had to admit that  a  he didn t know what type of air filter my car needed   b  he didn t have the tools to remove the old one  and  c  he didn t know how to properly install the new one  This is really confidence inspiring After this amusing demonstration  he proceeded to tell me that first is a  magical gear    I m not making this up    and that I always need to put it into first before trying to put it in reverse  I explained that I usually have it in first  because I m usually going slowly before wanting to go in reverse  but I acknowledged that I might not always do that I went away  trying to be sure to always have it in first before putting it in reverse  I found that without double clutching  I often wouldn t be able to get it into reverse anyway  I took the problem back to the dealership  and same condescending attitude from another staff person  who proceeded to tell me  oh no  it s not first  it s second that is the magical gear  On my third complaint about it  I got the nice fellow who works behind the counter to admit that based on his experience driving my car  there was a problem getting it into reverse  I wish I d gotten it in writing  He no longer works there and I haven t been able to get it fixed Among the other  admitedly minor  problems and or complaints I ve had with the car include  no interior trunk release  I have to get out of the car  with the key  to unlock the trunk  after many service attempts  my car is still often hard to start when cold   I m sure my starter will have a shorter life because of the amount of time I have to engage it to get the engine to start  And I don t live in a cold climate  interior dome light only works intermittently  Upon complaining about it  they reluctantly replaced the light bulb in it  though I d repeatedly explained it wasn t the bulb  because it was intermittent Overall  I do have to say that I really like the little car  and I like the refinements Ford has made to the Focus which really improve on the Escort  However  after my service experience  there isn t a snowball s chance in Hades that I ll ever buy another  And don t get me started about how much it s worth now   I had a local Saturn dealership make a trade in offer on it  and I was very sad  and decided to keep the car a bit longer to get some value out of the depreciation I ll have to eat when I sell it Things I like about it  handling  gas economy  sharp look  if a bit cartoonish  comfy seats  trunk space  even in the sedan model br br  
Neg, I drove a company 96 Explorer XLT for six months  which was used on and off road  The Explorer is a comfortable ride and has ample cargo space as compared to my 88 Jeep Cherokee and other small SUV s  With the back seats down  the vehicle was able to hold all of my field gear while conducting drilling activities on a hazardous waste site  Believe me  when you work on haz sites  there is a lot of gear to be toted around  The duel open action of the back window and tailgate was a nice convience  since you could just open the window to retrieve objects  With the hinges of the tailgate on top  the tailgate would act as a shelter during rain events where note pad could be kept dry I was very pleased with the on road handling of the Explorer  but was disappointed with its off road use  The auto 4WD function was a nice feature that operated flawlessly during the wet season  That was the only thing I like about the Explorer for off road use  My biggest beef was the low clearance of the vehicle  Tree branches were snagged by the frame on two separate occasions  On one occasion  a stick interfered with the gears of the vehicle  I could not get the truck out of gear until someone crawled beneath the vehicle and pulled the stick out  Try that repair alone on an off road trail  Another time the vehicle slipped into the tire ruts from heavy equipment and bottomed out  I was able to get out by immediately gunning the engine  I was surprised that the vehicle came out of that situation considering the lackluster of past 4 wheeling  Several times the Explorer could not pull itself out of a muddy area without a running go  These were similar areas that my 88 Cherokee handled with ease  One note  the Explorer probably would have done better with real mud tires I loved the vehicle for its on road use but hated its overall off road use  Who should buy  Anyone who wants the status of an SUV and does not plan any off road excursions except for maintained gravel roads  Who shouldn t  Anyone that needs a good 4WD vehicle for heavy off road use Because of the lackluster 4WD experience and low clearance of the 96 Explorer XLT  I upgraded my 88 Cherokee to a 96 Isuzu Trooper  which is also reviewed by me separately br br  
Neg, The Ford Explorer is not the biggest SUV  but it is too big for me  I cannot stand driving in it for many reasons  First  it is a very flimsy car and a collision with anything larger would mean my death  Also  it has horrible suspension which makes listening to cds impossible because of all the skipping and every ride is very uncomfortable  The gas mileage  although good compared to an expedition or excursion  is much worse than I would hope for  It is about 13 miles per gallon city  18 miles per gallon highway  With the gas prices as high as they are having a car which guzzles this amount of gas is killing my wallet  Finally  despite the atrocious size of this behemoth and the trouble I have in finding a parking place for it  it is still impossible to fit into  It has room for five people  if you and your friends don t have legs br br  
Neg, I purchased the Ford Explorer for its styling  space and published reports about the excellent performance I love the safety aspects of the vehicle and I hate the current performance of the vehicle  just crossed 50 000 miles The vehicle drives like a 10 year old truck ready to stop any minute The vehicle performed satisfactorily till about 48 000 miles when problems started  1  had to replace the engine thermostat  main gasket and water pump  2  had to replace the exhaust sensor 3  the transmission appears to be slipping  although the dealer says it is OK  and it is giving 14 miles per gallon The above repairs are in addition to the normal maintenance done on the vehicle like  1  replace battery  2  replace all 4 tires and align wheels 3  replace front and back brake pads and turn rotor br br  
Neg, My second Explorer  a 2WD 1996 has been a different experience than my first  a 1993 model  I have 35714 miles on it  and it is on its 3rd automatic transmission  This time around I am out of warranty  and out of luck  and after pleading my case with Ford  I was told they will offer no comment or assistance  Outside of several thousand dollars in repair expenses on a 3 year old vehicle on its 3rd transmission  the car has performed satisfactory The interior has remained solid  free of cracks and fading  amazing in the 110 degree summer heat of my area  It has not given me any engine troubles and the brakes and normal wear and tear items have been uneventful  They have reduced the cup holder size  and removed the slot for coffee cup handles  so that if you are drinking anything other than a fast food small drink  it will be on your lap due to lack of room Handling is O K  however as will as Explorers I have driven or owned  the rear wheels slide in wet conditions when making a corner  even at slow speeds The paint still looks new  my color was called Mocha  but looks Gold  and the black trim cleans up well  I would warn that dealing with Ford on repair issues can be painful at best  and to document EVERYTHING with the service department     
Neg, I drove a Ford Explorer for three years and I liked it until I realized what I was missing  Because it was my first car I had nothing to compare it to  but after having driven other cars I realize that the Explorer is not that great  Its suspension and handling are really awful compared to other cars in its class and it cost me a ridiculous amount of money for gas and all too frequent repairs  I was comfortable inside it but that was probably because I shelled out about  8 000 above the starting price for extras  Although SUVs are traditionally intended more for off roading and that type of thing I assume most people buying one right now would be interested in driving it everyday as I did  which is not something I recommend br br  
Neg,  Apparently the automatic closing sliding door feature is in earlier Windstars as well  but I m sure we would have heard about more injuries if they were made so improperly i b The Windstar 2001 b I went to visit my fiance at work yesterday  He works at a  Ford Dealership b  and often gets to see the features of new vehicles before they are released to the public  The one good feature I saw  is that the  2001 Windstars  come with  TV s and  VCR s   I m not a car person  and I don t know whether the earlier versions have TVs or not  Him and his co worker had a  Sony Playstation  hooked up and were playing games while in the comfort of a heated minivan b i The Downside b i They were sitting in the vehicle  and I was outside The side door was open  My Fiance s foot was hanging out the door  I lifted the handle  This vehicle has an b automatic door shut feature b  The door started to close  and wouldn t stop  I yelled at him to move his foot  Luckily  he did   The door shut and sealed itself quietly i  I couldn t believe this  He assured me there were sensors to stop the door  but when he was trying to show me  he had to wave his hands all over the place  and even still  it hardly ever stopped closing the door   There are only two little motion sensors b b i Let me ask you this i b What types of people usually use minivans like this   Families  Mothers with children b  If a mom were to turn her back  and the door starts to close  a kind near the door could be hurt very badly  Since the closing is virtually sound less  the only sounds would be the kid screaming over a lost finger b Other new features b  There is a low tire pressure warning system that lets you know when your tires are low  3 8 Litre  V6 engine  Power windows  locks  brakes  Child safety door locks b The Ford Company b As well as having a not so great vehicle here and there  the  Ford  company also has its downfalls  They don t honor warranty if you are at or even near the ending term or mileage limit  Their parts cost more than you can get at an independent dealer   FYI  The employees are charge fifteen percent MORE if they want to get something before their pay day i i In general  I don t feel that Ford Windstar 2001 is a very safe vehicle  but that s just my Epinion i b Thumbs down   or off    to Windstar b  
Neg, I first drove the 2001 Windstar as a rental in Orlando this January  I was quite impressed  It had a smooth ride  convenient features  and easy handling  So  when my husband switched to a job with a car allowance the next month  my vote was in  I did lots of internet research to find out what model we wanted  what the price ranges were  etc  We settled on a very nicely equipped model and found one for  600 under invoice and 3 9  financing  So we went to pick it up  Things went relatively smoothly at the dealership since the deal was already worked out  However  I was still there for over five hours  Anyway  about the van   Good Things   COMFORT  The Windstar has a very smooth ride and nice handling  It is very easy to drive and comfortable to ride in  It is so easy to get into that even my two and a half year old son can climb in by himself  The seats are comfortable and the driver s seat has great adjustments  The interior is generally roomy and cupholders are everywhere  SAFETY  All five of the rear seating positions are equipped with tether anchors  The van is equipped with flashers on the side mirrors and cornering lamps  The flashers on the side mirrors also flash whenever one of the sliding doors is open  warning others that a child may be about to dart in or out of the vehicle  Windstar has dual airbags and very good crash ratings  All the doors automatically lock when the vehicle is put in drive  There is even a sensor that is supposed to let you know if the tire inflation is incorrect  CONVENIENCE  When the rear seat is removed  the back will accommodate a full sheet of plywood  a real plus when you have to prepare for a hurricane  The keyless entry system comes in handy when you are juggling groceries and a toddler  The sliding doors always work smoothly  You can usually put just about whoever and whatever you need to into this van   Bad Things   PROBLEMS FROM THE VERY START  When we tried to install the cargo net  we found that one of the knobs was broken  The first time my husband removed the rear seat he discovered that there was a missing knob  When he took the van to the dealership  nearly 60 miles away  they did not have all of the necessary parts to fix it  He did not want to make another trip out to the dealership for something they had already had two opportunities to get right   so they said they would mail the part to us when it came in  We got the part alright   the WRONG one  This has yet to be resolved  A few weeks ago the battery was COMPLETELY dead for no apparent reason  Upon recharging it has been working fine  Right now there is already some sort of front end problem  The steering wheel makes a strange clicking noise when you turn it  All sorts of unexplained sounds have come and gone in the short time we have owned this vehicle  It is ridiculous In a nutshell   I will be glad when Saturn puts out a van  
Neg, Well its been a while since got a thread reply from epinion so will post what its been like with this car in over a year I too am very disappointed in what the car has to offer feature wise verus the MSRP price paid  over 40KwTT L One of the biggest was the lack of a full drivers information center giving an account of the cars functions  Your finding this now on cars costing half as much  At least it should have had Gas miles to empty It does not have dimming mirrors or lighted vanities The vanity mirrors are a sight to see  they are so flimsy and cheap looking  The car does not have a memory system to set seats  and other choices per drivers  The seats are very limited in power choices too  The passengers just goes backwards and forward  Would it have kill ford to put in a simple homelink system on the visor like the lincoln LS  after all its the same car basically No locking gas cap  they had to work overtime to cheap out this car  Another small item is the lack of clips to hold the floor mats in place  they are just light material sliding all over the place  The top is a major inconvenience off  its laying in the corner of the garage waiting till can get some friends over to put it back on  This seemed better than using that rickity looking cart  The cloth top has not closed properly since day one  I did go by a dealership but the repair recommendation made you wonder if would be worst off  Now for those wheels  they do nothing for the appearance of that car  looks like a hubcap set  As for running errands you are limited  the trunk is very shallow  a bag of groceries or even a slightly large boxed item will not fit back there  So you try and put it in the seat beside you hoping a brad is not on the bottom to scratch the colored seats  You do need a 2nd vehicle  practical  along with this thing On the motor I m not a mechanic but it doesn t have that much get up and go  It will go but not like the old push rod motors  You seem to plan your passing in advance  Top may be good but low end punch would be nicer  On the window dropping to allow door to open well don t open the door fast or it has not completed and shakes the glass  If it forgets to drop you have to really push it open  This may be a big problem as the cars age and more electrical glitches develop  All the articles and reports of unsold 02 03 units just sitting on lots with Ford slashing prices and offering rebate to try and rid of these cars  Does not make you feel good about spending this much on a car either  Gosh 04 s coming and they still can t sell the 02 s  Ford announced the cancellation of the car too after a year on the market  
Neg, Ford has once again tried to bring back the Thunderbird  But let s face it  The car that has carried the Thunderbird name for half a century has really been about five or six distinctly different cars  Other than the name  these cars have nothing in common  The only version that sparked any interest was the 1950 s T Bird s  And the 1950 s were the last time a Thunderbird was ever a respected and exciting vehicle  It s been a downward spiral ever since with the exception of the SuperCoupe from 1989 1995  arguably the fastest T birds ever made I own a 1989 Thunderbird and it happens to be a very ordinary passenger car with the exception of some luxury features not found on other vehicles  The 2003 Thunderbird is more of the same except with a different look  and a grossly inflated price  Who is going to pay  65 000 for a Lincoln with a T Bird name on it  These days it seems that anything with a different look is popular  regardless of what lies underneath  And what lies underneath is the same Thunderbird I drive everyday  which was less than half the price compared to the 2003 The fact is  the Thunderbird lost its   Mojo  after the 50 s and became yet another family car with a puny engine It s hard to imagine that this car was EVER compared to Corvette s  It would be like Ferrari taking the Maranello  adding room for four people  popping in a 200hp engine  and raising the price to a million dollars  Anyone interested  Didn t think so For the T Bird to be reborn  Ford needs to drop a big time V8 engine in it  with somewhere in the neighbourhood of 350 400 horsepower and 5 second 0 60 times  Then we will have the Thunderbird the way it was meant to be originally  A sports car again  Chris 
Neg, What you are about to read is what I got from a weekend rental of the 2003 Ford Escape  I was kinda excited when I found out I would be able to drive one of these for a whole weekend in my search for an SUV  Our local Ford Dealer had no problem letting me take the vehicle for the whole weekend  He was sure I would be back on Monday to make a purchase Well once I first got in the vehicle I did feel alot of comfort  After checking out my surroundings I did notice that the head room was incredible  but how much do you really need  The seats are comfortable  but pretty boring  they were just a plain tan color just average  After a couple minutes  I really felt as it I was in a Dodge Caravan of the late 80 s  It just has the feel of a mini van  I was very disappointed with the center console  it is nothing more than a huge pit  There is nothing there to really hold any Cd s  spare change  whatever it may be  It was basically a 2nd glove box  Nothing spectacular Once I started the car up I could tell the power  upon trying to put the vehicle in drive I notice that the gear selector is on the column  Didn t we phase this out yet  very outdated  Once I left the lot  I noticed right away that the engine had power  but was pretty loud  The vehicle has excellent pick up The Escape I borrowed had very few options  basically a stripped model with floor mats  and mud guards  The options it did have like power windows  power door locks  etc  were all placed basically the same place as any other vehicle  and they are all within comfortable reach of the driver  Radio had some definite volume  but you need to so you can hear music over the road noise Once I finally got on the highway and pulled out on the on ramp  I was ready to take the car back to the dealer  The engine though peppy is extremely loud as well as the road noise of the vehicle  I found myself talking much loader than normal to be able to communicate with my passenger  Very disappointing with the road noise  but speed and handling were very nice To keep this short  I had the vehicle all weekend  and hardly drove it at all once I got home  It is pretty basic  and a little boring  The V 6 Engine had more than enough power  but they need to build something around it SUMMARY It is definitely one of the lower priced 4X4 vehicles  but there are other options out there  I would suggest looking to other makes and models  As the salesman told me  All the fathers are buying these for their daughters  So maybe the road noise is an outta sight outta mind kinda thing  Good luck in your SUV searches  
Neg, I purchased our Ford Taurus LX Wagon used with 19K miles and we bought it because I was impressed by it s long list of features and by the way it drove  We had just sold our Ford Aerostar minivan and we were looking for a smaller  more economical family car  What we ended up was a car that just cannot be repaired properly and is not very reliable We have had problems with the interior door panels cracking  the dash bubbling  the power window motors burning out  turn signals that work when they want to  a moon roof that has hardly ever worked  inability to align the front end so we go through a pair of tires every 20K miles  I have only had it serviced by Ford and they have failed to repair most of our problems even after numerous attempts  The Ford dealers no longer believe in test drives  they just look for a problem and charge you even if they cannot find it  I got charged  75 00 to be told that I needed a new  55 00 battery  I also took the car in to have a rubber seal around the door replaced and they charged me  30 00 just to tell me how much it would cost to replace This is my 3rd and last Ford  I had two Ford Explorers and Ford bought both of them back under the California Lemon Law I wanted to love this car  I wanted to forget about my bad experiences with my two previous Explorers but this car is by far worst in every manner I have had it with Ford  Quality is not Job  1  Profit is  Don t even get me started about the fact that Ford knew about the Firestone tire defects for years but still kept putting them on my Explorer and all others  I was the lucky one who is still around to express my displeasure with Ford  The only reason I still have our Taurus because the value has dropped faster than my loan for it  If I sold it today I would lose a few thousand bucks     
Neg, In 1996 my wife and I purchased our Ford Taurus GL wagon with an extended warranty  The warranty was a GE Capital product that covered the car out to 100 000 miles When we first bought the car  we were really happy with it  At the two and a half year point  the problems started  On a trip  my father noticed oil leaking from the car  When I check the oil  the dipstick came up clean   no oil  The car was four quarts low on oil and I had not received so much as an oil light  The gage light in the vehicle checks only pressure of the oil  and not oil level I immediately took the car in for service  A failed gasket was found at the base of the oil pan  This was repaired under warranty  No further damage was apparent  As for the oil light  I was told that this only comes on in extreme conditions  The service manager on duty informed me that if the oil light comes on  the engine is probably to the point where serious damage is being done Well  this ended up as the tip of the iceberg  When the car had 78 000 miles on it  my wife was driving and I was away on a business trip  It was over 100 degrees and the engine seized up with no warning  My wife and two young children were stranded for an hour before they got help When my wife called the dealership where we purchased the car  they instructed her to have it towed their  They made her sign an agreement saying she would be responsible for the cost of any repair work that was no covered under warranty  They also told her that this repair would almost certainly be covered under warranty  but the claims adjuster would have to look at the car I m sure you see the writing on the wall  After several hundred dollars in labor and no real repairs  my wife was told that the car was not covered under our warranty  Her attention was directed to the fine print that stated that engine over heat  regardless of the cause  is not covered  We had meticulously documented all maintenance on this vehicle  and even in spite of our previous problems the vehicle repairs were not covered  To make matters worse  I later discovered that if I had purchased a Ford extended warranty rather than the GE warranty  the repairs would have been covered  The reason this made me furious was that I was going to buy the Ford warranty  but  the sales staff told me that the GE product was better and cheaper The final straw came when I made one of several calls to Ford Motor Corporation to complain  I was told that the problems I experienced were  quot due to normal wear and tear quot I will never again buy another Ford product I am only giving this vehicle 1 star because I can not give it less br br  
Neg, What could anyone be thinking to buy this truck  As my good friend Foxspy said  its not a truck  Its a compact car with an oversize trunk b Pro  s you say  You want pro s to this car  Ok  I ll try  but its not going to be easy It sits five people  That s nice  What I left out in the original sentence is that it sits two people comfortably  The red paint is really nice  as said before  Ford really knows how to do paint  they might as well be able to do something right  Four doors is awesome  it has the two butterfly doors  making loading easier  but not easy  The Tonneau cover that this truck came with is a nice addition  but even it has its cons  It offers a full size spare  but what pick up doesn t  That s enough for pro s  I m worn out with all of this thinking  I m going to something that comes a little easier b CONS b This is the Princess of  quot Fix or Repair Daily quot  The model of which I speak is a 1999  little over 15 000 miles on the clock  How many times to the shop  Too many  lets see  its already had to have a recall done on the cruise control  IT WOULDN T SHUT OFF  After that  it had automatic windshield wipers  but not as fancy as the Cadillac Rainsense wipers  these wipers would just come on for no particular reason  This has been happening to lots of these trucks according to the dealer  Transmission problems are normal right  Not three months after you buy a brand new truck  Its been in the shop for other reasons  but they fail my memory right now  Not a reliable truck er car Updated 8 9 So the Ranger got good crash test ratings  How about a real world account  Two more teens I know just purchased 1999 s and 2000 s  which is something I will not stop ridiculing them for  What a stupid choice  Anyways  one of them got a little out of control at highway speeds and ended up totalling the front end of the truck  The airbags did not deploy until she had successfully smashed her nose on the steering wheel  If thats not bad enough  then the airbag deployed and slammed her back  If you even consider purchasing this truck  I will never read another of your articles or consider you a peer  as you are obviously mentally challenged Loading  Good luck  the fold down rear seats fold down so you have to CLIMB OVER THEM Updated 8 9 Four bangers are notorious for good gas mileage right  Not with the Ranger  with this iddy bitty inline four cylinder  I d expect to get at least 40 highway  my friend swore she got thirty miles per gallon  which her particular truck did  but any other owner of a 2 5 liter I4 will report never even touching 20mpg  Now you may say this is ok  I might too  if it was a Vortec 4300 with power  but it is gutless  Its outfitted with a towing package  but if you can find something it ll tow  let me know  You couldn t tow a jetski in this thing with all of the hills on the way to Lake Powell  or into Phoenix for Lake Pleasant Updated  4 25 Rear spring weight is useless  Me and a friend asked her why her rear end was so close to the ground  she replied that she had some cement in the back  No more thought given  I was on my motorcycle and asked her if she could take my backpack home  she agreed This truck does have better payload than a motorcycle  I opened the trunk I mean Tonneau cover  only to discover two bags of 85 lb  cement  Thats not even the weight of the average male  With the rear end sag  I was expecting to see at least seven bags The Tonneau cover looks awesome on this truck  it is very nice that Ford is implementing their trucks with such a cheap accessory to try to make up for more expensive problems   Tonneau is actually a company that makes bed covers  but recently all bed  quot lids quot  have been referred to as  quot Tonneau quot  Snug Top and quite a few other companies make similar products  I believe the cover on my friends car is a Snug Top  the weather stripping has already let go and it feels really flimsy to hold lift up on the handle  Rear gate lifters that are standard in most SUV s for the rear window and or rear gate are all that holds this Tonneau cover up  it seems that a much more effective way could have been implemented The stock rims look pretty nice  but with one minor deficiency  They come apart  Another friend who owns an even crappier 1999 had a rim disintegrate at 45 mph  he is lucky he missed all of the trees  I don t even want to get started on his truck because he has abused it so much its hard to say whether the problems are his fault or Ford s  My other friend is a well mannered girl that is very gentle with her truck b Overall  She did get a pretty good deal on the truck  walking out the door with a brand new semi furnished  barely driven  truck for  12 000 A better idea would have been a Ford Focus Although after reading some reviews  or Chevy Metro  since she d have the same amount of room  better gas mileage  better back seat  generally everything would be better b Alternative  For those looking for a much better truck  a Chevy S 10 with either the 2 2 liter Vortec or 4 3 liter Vortec are recommended by me after lots of research  Especially the 4 3 liter Vortec The 4 0 liter version of this truck  whom another friend owns  is just as fast as the Chevy S 10  But guess what size engine the Chevy has in it  2 2 Liter Vortec  So  for the Chevy you ll pay less  get better gas mileage and be able to keep up with Ford V6 s  Not to mention my friend had to replace his engine at 107 000 miles b Rest in Peace  Update 7 7 00 Well  it is under unfortunate circumstances that I write this update  My friend  whom I ve recently fallen out of friendship with  had a number of problems with her  1999 XLT Ford Ranger SuperCab 2 3 Liter Inline Four Cylinder Automatic   It refused to start on numerous occasions  it was running extremely rough  and the recalls were just too much  It turns out my friend didn t get the warranty I thought she did  They traded this POS in on a 2000 F 150 4 6 Liter V8 with 5 000 miles on it Will they ever learn  The Ranger was trouble from the day it was designed  to the day it was traded in  I feel guilty giving this truck one star  since it doesn t even deserve that b R I P b i Little truck  rest in peace i Born August 1999  Died July 2000 A total of 25 000 gentle miles were placed on this Ford Yet it was just too much  she couldn t handle it She is survived by two sisters  a 1993 3 0 Liter Ranger  a 1996 Dodge Avenger  a mother  a 1989 AeroStar  and has been replaced by a larger  but probably as troublesome F 150 She won t be missed  but won t be forgotten May others learn from her mistakes Who would I recommend this truck for  My worst enemy br br  
Neg, UPDATE   Well  I decided not to keep it  Had a flat and the spare tire lock was corroded into place so bad the dealer had to tear out the spare carrier and replace it under warranty The brakes started grabbing pretty bad in the wet and the local dealer couldn t find the problem  The only reason I went to them was because the dealer I felt I could trust basically told me to take my truck somewhere else  Didn t even want to do the 35 000 mile check  Bottom line   Read the fine print  Ford s bumper to bumper 36 000 mile warranty is only applicable to problems that they find convenient to fix or  in fixing  won t reveal a major  costly screw up on their part Unfortunately  there wasn t another truck around that met my expectations after having the Ranger  Looked at SUVs   no go  Ended up saying to hell with it and bought a new 2001 Honda Accord EX V6  Hey  Ford  it could have been a maxxed out Taurus  but  well  you know how it goes ORIGINAL   The following opinion is as much a commentary on Ford as on my vehicle I ve got a  99 Ranger Supercab XLT Sport  2 5L  5spd  4x2 which I purchased on 12 31 00  It s been into a couple of local dealers in an effort to get  issues  worked out  I now have about 31k on it and am debating with myself whether or not to take the hit and dump it  I purchased the Ford as a replacement for my  87 Mazda B2000 Cab Plus which was getting a little tired after 12 years and 180 thou  It still ran OK and got 22 23 MPH on the road  but was getting pretty rusty and needed a new clutch I have had the fuel gauge sender replaced at about 2000 miles  Ford has real problems with these accross all their vehicles  from what I can tell  problems with the heater doors  the usual wiper switch problem  etc  What has surprised me is that Ford has had some of the same problems for years and doesn t do anything about them  Right off the bat  I started getting 16 MPH  I knew that the engine wasn t broken in  it was winter  etc  etc  but 95  of my driving is on the highway  I wouldn t have been surprised to get low 20 s  as the EPA rating is 22 27  Took it back to the dealer  who said they  checked it with their computer and it said 27 MPH  Pure BS   this truck never has and never will get anything above 22  With EFI  I had expected it to better my carbureted 2L Mazda The real clincher started to show up at about 5 000  I started to notice what felt like an abnormal amount of play in the drivetrain  like a bike with a very loose chain  accompanied by a noticeable  clunk  whenever I applied or released the clutch  I brought it to the dealer s attention and  after playing like they didn t understand what I was referring to  said it was  normal  It kept getting worse and I kept bringing it to their attention everytime I took it in for service  The service manager laid out a sheaf of TSB s which he said stated that it was normal for the  clunk  in the Ranger  When I pointed out that all of the TSBs only related to 4X4s  he couldn t come up with a justification  Thinking it was the rear end  I requested that they check it  They did and declared it to be  normal  More on this later After getting the Ford District Rep to check my truck  again   normal  I requested Arbitration   I live in Illinois and that s the extent of their Lemon Law  By this time the problem was affecting the shifting and was noticeable to anyone outside the truck  After doing the dance with the Ford s Dispute Settlement Board  it was agreed that I would get a new gearbox  because  after all  the diff was OK  Last spring a new 5 spd was put in my truck  No change  I started going to a dealer in another town  They took a look at the problem and immediately noticed play in the rear end  They found severe wear and ended up replacing everything but the ring and pinion  Still no change  A month or so later I stopped by to let them know I was still having problems and that it was now binding up on 1 2 shifts  Tear down the new tranny and replace synchronizers  Quite possibly my old tranny won t have had this problem A couple of weeks ago I took the truck in for its  30k service and to determine once and for all just what was going on  The mechanic who had worked on the rear end previously test drove the truck and thought the problem was worse than ever  He called Ford Engineering  who basically told him that they weren t going to do anything about my problem  Period  end of story  Another mechanic there explained that this attitude was the reason he had a Japanese SUV   he couldn t trust the American vehicles  So here I am  Do I keep it  and continue replacing differentials at my own expense  or dump it for another truck  I ve driven almost everything else out there and am even more disappointed  The Sport package on my truck provides the 4x4 suspension  which  with the rack and pinion steering  provides handling that literally nothing else on the market can match  short of shelling out for a 4x4 that I don t need  The 4x2 Toyotas handle like drunken sailors by comparison  even with the TRD package  The Dual Media  4 speaker stereo is the best I ve heard in a truck and many cars  The truck is a dream to drive down the highway  until I have to shift  
Neg, We recently had the chance to drive 2 of these trucks through Budget Rentals  We decided to rent the trucks because of the deal they were having  One of them had 3600 miles on it and the other one had 3200  I think having driven two that I can compare really helps my insight into them Both of these were the 4 cylinder Automatic Transmition with the Hard top bed cover  Both were the extended cab I liked the amount of room in the cab when there are just 2 people and the adjustable shoulder straps were a great asset  The seats were very uncomfortable for such a long trip  My husband ended up having to sit on a pillow on the way back With the hard top bed cover  it made it almost impossible to carry much or to carry anything very large  I ran into problems with it twice  Once I left the item to home and the second time I loaded what I could and went home and borrowed my mother s truck  a couple of years older and a 6 cylinder  to haul the rest of the things The truck drove very well on the flat lands  but when we got up in the mountains it had a hard time handling the inclines  We often lost power in it  Also  it would often kick out of overdrive by itself  My mother says that hers does not do that  but it could be a feature on this model The air conditioner worked great and I loved the cd player that it had in it  I would have to say that the part that I liked best was the cute little buttons that came on the keychain so that you could lock the doors remotely  That was fun  Great for scaring people because if you push it twice  the horn blows  The horn can also blow if you are inside the building and press the horn button  My son tried THAT one out All in all  I would discourage anyone that wanted to carry alot of things in it  ie use it as a truck  or if you lived in the mountains     
Neg, OH  I Just Love my Bright Red  Super Cab Ranger with The AWESOME Sports Package  But I m finding that Ford s Famous Saying  quot Quality Is Job One quot  is far from the truth  I own an 1988 Ford Ranger with almost 200 000 miles on it that s much Superior to my 1999 Ranger  I m finding that there s many flaws in the paint  There are several spots where there was dirt under the paint and now the paint has come off  The Optional Bigger engine with more horsepower as compared to the Imports standard engine is way below standards  The cheap look and Quality of the inside door panels and Door Pulls are very Disgusting  A Few weeks after I bought this Truck  the Door Pull and panel behind it started to peel  I had this replaced and guess what  The Second one is doing the same thing  Yes  I Do Love the Outside Looks of My Truck  But I seriously Doubt that I ll ever buy another Ford  That s one reason why I just purchased a Subaru Car instead of a Ford Focus  And I have bought Ford s all my Life  May I Ask Ford  why the price keeps going up and the Quality Keeps Going Down  Better Be Careful Ford  Because the Love of Money may just end up hurting you in the Long Run  It Just Cost You An  18 500 Sale with me br br  
Neg, Yes  I am not kidding  After only 9 000 miles and none in 4WD my dealer informed me the weird rattling noise I was experiencing required a new engine  Six weeks for the new engine to arrive  Two weeks in the shop with no loaner vehicle  I picked up my brand new truck with it s even newer engine to hear the noise again Another three weeks at the dealer without a loaner for me  a Ford engineer examined the truck and the customer service rep examined the issues and my request to buy the truck back  the problem was determined inherent Warning I have heard from reliable sources  the service people and others on line  this is not inherent   Ford knows about the noise and is refusing at this time to buy the trucks experiencing the noise back   specifically 1999 3 0 V6 4WD  Just thought you all should know br br  
Neg, For all you folks who may own a 1994 F 150  have you ever had a flat tire  If you havn t you just may want to check your jack  Yes it should be there but it will do you no good  The owners manual gives you 2 choices of jacking positions  a primary and a secondary  here is where the problem lies  Your jack is too big for the primary point  won t fit there  and not tall enough to use the secondary  won t lift the truck enough to put on the tire  According to the service manager at the local Ford Dealer there was a notice on this four years ago  but no fix  I have been fighting for answers for three weeks now  to no avail and no help from Ford  Best advice the dealer could give me was buy an aftermarket jack  not the answer I expected  I currently own two Fords  a Crown Vic  and the Truck  These will be my last all for the sake of a  20 00 jack  SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER a concept lost to the Ford Motor Company  A word to the wise  check this problem out before you too are stranded br br  
Neg, I had in my head  a great review for the  2000 Ford Ranger  and then tires were recalled  That alone made me want to return my truck  Then to top it all off  I open up the newspaper and lo and behold   ANOTHER RECALL   This time it s the seat belts  This leaves me with the thought    quot what next quot i  I feel like I m driving a time bomb  ready to go off  I will share my thoughts and feelings about the   2000 Ford Ranger  recalls aside  but I really needed to let you know how the recent recalls have affected my opinion on my vehicle  I will never buy another Ford  ever again   The 2000 Ford Ranger  is a sporty truck with power  I had previously owned a  92 Ford Ranger   but with the 2000 model  Ford had jazzed it up a bit  It s an awesome truck for someone who wants to have the ability to haul with a pick up truck  and the easy handling of a car   What I like about my 2000 Ford Ranger b They made the hood look more like a Dodge Ram  I think this gives the truck the illusion that it is actually bigger than it is  The handling is sweet  The truck almost steers itself  You feel as if yo are just guiding the truck in the general direction and it is doing the rest itself  The cab is roomy  We have the extended cab but I noticed they had actually widened the cab from the previous 92 Ranger that I had owned  I love how powerful the engine is  It accelerates so quickly and smoothly  It doesn t feel at all like a truck   What I dislike about my Ford Ranger b  Well  aside from the fact that my tire could blow at any minute and my seat belt might fail  I really don t dislike my truck  Major tongue in cheek here  I do LOVE my truck  I don t the problems I ve had with the tires and now the seat belt so because of that  it makes me wish I had not purchased this vehicle  This is something I strongly dislike about my Ford Ranger  Honestly  if it weren t for these recalls I d have nothing to put here  The truck is beautiful and handles like a dream  It runs well  and gets decent gas mileage  crud from Ford anymore br br  
Neg, That I am writing a review of this kind of truck is more or less an accident of fate I rented one for use on a project that required something with a little space for hauling electronic equipment around work sites  It looked pretty good   bright red  shiny it even drove well  Handling seemed adequate  and the v6 engine delivered ok performance  Crawling around the vehicle  out of curiosity  revealed that it seemed more maintainable that some of the more luxurious offerings in the truck classes by Ford  It looked like you could get at stuff under the hood  and the suspension running gear even looked truck like On closer examination  I decided that I really did not like the cab arrangement the addition of the little extra doors is questionable  There is no real body mass under the cab roof because of those doors  and my impression was that rollover safety is reduced  Behind the front seats there is so little space that all it would be useful for is to store stuff stuff like the flares and emergency road equipment that you might need  You certainly would not want to torture anyone larger than a small child by putting them back there The bed cover seemed a nice touch but the latches were not reliable  and you had to fiddle with them to get the lid locked down  And it did not take long to realize the disadvantage of the lid versus a cap   if you fill the bed up with stuff that wants to get higher than the bed walls  you can t close the lid  Payload is thus limited severely  Oh and it leaked The thing that really solidified my opinion of this  quot truck quot  was that one morning it simply failed to start  It turned out to be the security system  according to the rental people  when they arrived with a replacement for it and a flatbed to haul it off  It was apparently not an isolated case The Ranger appears to be another attempt by a major manufacturer build something that will appeal to people who want a truck  but are economy minded  The corner cutting makes the truck not really desirable if you want any kind of workhorse br br  
Neg, The Ford Ranger pickup with the extended cab is a great size  it is nice looking  and its probably a lot of fun to drive  not that I would really know  Here s my experience with one just last week Budget has a special on the Ford Ranger truck where you can rent one  with a locking bed cover  for  20 a day  So I booked one  Twice  The first time they didn t have any  so they gave me a Taurus  see my review at  a href auto review 778A 17C334B 390A32D3 prod5 http www epinions com auto review 778A 17C334B 390A32D3 prod5 a    The second time they had several Rangers on the lot  and I got a beautiful new white 4WD model  I was really looking forward to enjoying this truck for a week  Until       I couldn t put my two childrens  child safety seats in the truck b  The Ranger has two fold down  diagonally oriented jump seats in the extended cab  They are equipped with an auto retracting lap belt  Child seats were completely unusable in this truck  except in the front bench seat  provided I could detach my right arm to make room for the middle mounted seat  This was a surprise to me since I own a Toyota Xtra Cab pickup that is similar in size to the Ranger  and in it the properly forward facing jump seats very safely accommodate both child seats in the back The truck started easily  ran well  and was quite comfortable during my ride from the parking space at the rental car pick up area to the loading area where I couldn t put the kids  seats in  and back to the parking space  a total of about 100 meters  I had to trade the Ranger in for a Hyundai  Now I m no fan of Ford  but Hyundais are just embarrassing  I did get the seats in that though So I have to give the Ranger a poor rating due to its family un friendliness  Its a shame that I never had the chance to take it out on the open road  drive with gusto  and have it break down on me  like just about all Fords I ve ever driven have   Did you read the Taurus review  But to its credit  it seems like such a cool truck otherwise  that if I happen to be renting again at a time when I don t need to use child seats in it  I ll give the Ford Ranger another shot br br  
Neg, Previously having owned a 1997 V8 Explorer Limited  I was anxious to get into a 2003 Explorer as my rental while my Supra was getting more than a month s worth of repairs  How did I like my new transportation for the next couple of months  Other than having a lot more space than my sports car  it was an overall terrible experience POSITIVES  Before we dive into the bad stuff  let s start with the stuff that I like 1  EXTERIOR APPEARANCE  When you look at this car from the outside  it looks very grand  beautiful  and much nicer than the previous Explorer  It combines the more classic looks of the original Explorer with the more radically curvaceous looks of the model before this one  It looks more like an SUV than a soccer mom vehicle  or a glorified station wagon  It s very nice looking on the outside 2  INTERIOR APPEARANCE  Ford did make an attempt to stay with the times and add some strange trim to it  It looks like a silly silvery fake carbon fiber trim on the dash and doors       but for some reason  I like the way it mixed with my silver Explorer  and the dark grey interior  It was a nice package 3  INTERIOR SPACE  Immediately you notice this is MUCH larger than the previous Explorers  Not only can you pop up a third row of seats  albeit not as roomy as the middle row  but you can fold down everything in the back to carry large items  I relocated a 30 gallon aquarium  twin sized mattress and desk  many rounds of friends  stuff from apartments during college semester moving times  etc  It really did have a lot of space  much more than I was accustomed to with the 1997 Explorer  Good improvement NEGATIVES  The above really just sums it up for the new Explorer s positives  now       let s go on with the negatives  This will be an easier and longer list to make 1  FLAWED SEATBELT WARNING SYSTEM  In an attempt to encourage drivers to wear their seatbelt all the time  Ford came up with a seemingly good system       after you start driving  if you do not have a seatbelt on       you will hear a very loud and audible alert for about 10 to 15 seconds  This reminded me many times to put my seatbelt on  Why is it flawed  Let s say you wanted to quickly pull from your parking spot to your apartment complex mailbox and run in there for a second  You park  you put your car in Park  and you walk in while your girlfriend waits for you       while the car is in park  this seatbelt warning continues to beep and repeat every 20 or 30 seconds  for about 10 to 15 seconds       also  if you put your seatbelt on immediately once you hear the sound  you get to continue to hear the warning sign for the duration of its time  Ford engineers should ve caused this to automatically disable when the car is in park  and turn off when the seatbelt plugs in  Their mistake  Maybe it will be corrected in the future  but it is not for the 2003 s  We ll just call it  Good Game  try again  since this feature can be disabled  and maybe they can correct it in the future or make a recall 2  SEATS  The cloth seats have a bad habit of bunching up and catching your clothes  not to mention if you make a relatively sharp turn  without any bucket like characteristics       you will slide the opposite way of your turn  whether it be into the center or the door   3  COUNTER INTUITIVE LOCKS  I can t tell you how many times I had to unlock the doors  cause all the passengers in the car couldn t figure out which way the door locks work  It is the exact opposite of what you expect  Maybe check this out next time you see one  and you will know what I am talking about  It s a switch you push or pull  with no red indicator  and it s kind of a half button thing       it s terrible design 4  ENGINE  The engine is terrible       I sometimes wonder if there is anything slower on the road  I see a Ford Festiva or a Chevy Metro across the light  and I am thinking   There is no way that can be slower than this thing  It takes me a good long time to get to 60 mph  Also  if you are a speed demon and should drive at high speeds  once you hit the 107 mph speed limiter  instead of limiting you gently at that speed  it violently cuts fuel jerking the car dangerously slower in a sudden manner  and very roughly  Of course  you may not have enough time or road to get going this fast       since it is so slow 5  OFF ROAD CAPABILITY  Although it looks capable  the 2WD version certainly is not  I can t speak for the 4WD or AWD versions  but the 2WD V6 is anything but       it s just a jacked up  roomy station wagon   P 6  FUEL ECONOMY  You can expect below 20 mpg  if not right at 20 mpg on the highway  and closer to 15 mpg in the city during regular driving  even with this small engine  The EPA window sticker fuel economy rating for this is 16 21  and seems to be pretty close  In a foreign SUV  even with more weight and power  you can get better fuel economy 7  AIR CONDITIONING  Not only is this air conditioner unbearably loud       in fact  so unbearably loud that when up all the way in the front and the back       you can t hear anyone who is not within a few inches of your ear  Makes conversation tough  if not impossible       this unit also takes a long time to cool down in Texas heat  which may sound normal  but it takes much longer than older cars I have driven  Once you have driven for a while  the unit gets extraordinarily cold  though  but it s very temperamental 8  CHEAP TRIM  The outside trim is extraordinarily cheap  Someone closed the rear door relatively hard  and the trim started coming loose  the rental car company said this was normal with their Explorer       and noted it on the damage before I took the car 9  STEREO  The stereo was terrible  if you turn volume up at all       it starts to crackle and mumble together  This did succeed  however  in breaking my habit of listening to loud music       since at loud volume levels  it doesn t sound like music anymore in the Explorer  Also  when you forward or rewind  it sounds like it is forwarding rewinding fast at first       although it seems to be going at the exact same 1x play rate and just jumbling up the sound  It takes a solid 5 to 10 seconds to increase the rate of forward rewind  but spends too long doing so       making this a very useless feature  and much more useless than it otherwise could have been 10  HORN PLACEMENT  This may seem like a small thing  but usually when someone is in need of using the horn       they are in a high stress tension situation  often reacting to an emergency  In this car  you have to remove your hand from the perimeter of the wheel and push on the inside of the wheel  The horn is not accessible with the thumbs in anyway while holding on to the steering wheel  Other car manufacturers think of these little ergonomic issues  while Ford apparently does not 11  BRAKING  The brakes fade very quickly  and if they did this while I was not towing anything       I can only imagine how dangerous and amplified this would be if I were towing a boat      The handling in this car is what I would expect out of an SUV       although it feels less prone to roll over than the 1997 version of the car  it certainly feels as if it is going to roll after each curve       maybe this is because of the news attention Explorers have recently gotten about rollovers and me just psyching myself out       but  it is definately not a handling machine Ride quality is moderate on smooth road  but still has quite a bit of road noise       however  a bump will send you flying higher than you expect I believe that sums it up  although I may have mixed up a few things       but I believe this car is not worth the money  at all       and priced into it is the hype that has come with the Explorer since it became the best selling SUV a number of years ago  I would look to Chevrolet or a foreign manufacturer for a better built SUV       you can even get a lightly used Mercedes ML320  which will probably be more reliable  for less than this vehicle  and although that is not a perfect vehicle       it is far better value than this one Best of luck  and I hope I have been helpful  and I hope I didn t upset any owners of this vehicle       best wishes on your automotive search  
Neg,  B ack when the Ford Focus was introduced in late 1999 as a 2000 model it boasted many attributes that surpassed the competition  It had bold styling  a modern interior with plenty of amenities  a good price  and good fuel economy  Fortunately for us  the consumers  and unfortunately for Ford Motor Company other cars such as the Toyota Matrix  Suzuki Aerio followed in the Focus s footsteps and created an equally if not better automobile to compete b For 2002  the Ford Focus Sedan comes in 3 trim lines  the LX  the SE  and the ZTS  While a 2 0 SOHC engine that produces 110 hp is standard on the LX and SE models  my test SE sedan was equipped with a 2 0 DOHC Ztec 4 cylinder  The ZTS sedan comes standard with the DOHC Ztec engine  The 2 0 Ztec puts out a healthy 130 horsepower at 5 300 RPM and 135 lb ft of torque at 4 500 RPM  2 transmissions are offered this year  a 5 speed manual and a 4 speed automatic  which was equipped on my tester i Driving Impressions i Off the line  acceleration  is disappointing  Having the 130 horsepower Ztec engine I was expecting close to the same performance of the old Escort ZX2 or the 2000 ZX3 5 speed  which had the same engine  The automatic transmission really hampers any sort of rush in power  and when accelerating hard or even slightly hard the engine makes quite a bit of noise  Since the Ford Focus SE s Ztec engine gets its peak torque at a relatively low RPM  take offs are adequate  but that s it  nothing exciting  just adequate  The 4 speed fully automatic transmission plays a big role in this lackluster performance  At times I could have sworn I was driving a car with a 10 year old transmission  clunking into gear  and odd shifting patterns were common   Handling  in the 2002 Ford Focus SE Sedan was quite impressive  as it was back in its introduction year  The Focus SE remains composed at almost all times  and is surprisingly controllable through hard turns  The suspension made this small sedan very nimble and relatively fun to drive on the twistys   Cruising  in this sedan is also quite good  The ride is firm and sporty  yet does not jolt the driver or passengers from their comfortable seating positions  Cruising at 65 70 MPH can be a little loud with the wind  engine and road noise  but unless you are  super picky  it won t bother you enough to change your buying decision  Hills are taken with a little strain  the 4 speed automatic will down shift on steep inclines  and the engine will get quite loud  but you definitely will not be left in the far right lane on those 10 lane hilly freeways   Braking  is average  my tester came with the  so common  front disc rear drum set up with no ABS so braking was not a grand offering  but they did do their job of stopping this small sedan with little fuss   Fuel economy  is average for a car in this class  the EPA rates this car at 26 31 MPG with the Z tec engine mated with an automatic transmission   Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  of the 2002 Ford Focus SE is very edgy new wave  The dash board is very distinctive yet offers good good ergonomics and easy to read instrumentation  Even despite not having a tachometer the instrument cluster is well designed with plenty of useful gauges  While the interior of the Ford Focus is almost all plastic  the plastic looks good  and is much less plasticy looking many cars in this category  Amenities are plentiful with the comfort Ztec package  600    Amenities include AC  CC  keyless entry  power windows and locks  tilt steering  an Am Fm CD player that you will probably want to replace  cup holders  front air bags  and more  The front bucket eats are made of a cheap cloth but are surprisingly comfortable  These seats offer height adjustments and adequate support  Room is average  plenty of room up front  but the rear 60 40 split folding seats will most likely offer a cramped environment for rear passengers  The Focus however does boast plenty of rear headroom  and the trunk is spacious enough for 1 weeks worth of groceries i Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior  of the Ford Focus Sedan remains unchanged since its introduction in 2000  While once considered an  eye catcher  the Focus now blends in with a profusion of other look alike cars  i e  Suzuki Aerio  The exterior  like the interior is very edgy with long triangular headlamps in front and more pudgy triangular tail lamps   Price  Reliability    Warranty i  The 2002 Ford Focus SE Sedan with the comfort Ztec package comes to almost  16 000  Since this is the middle of the year Ford is offer some good APR rates  The Ford Focus has been a reliable car since its introduction  and the Ztec has been a reliable engine since 1997  If anything does happen to your 2002 Ford Focus Ford offers an unimpressive 3 year  36 000 mile bumper to bumper warranty  and an extended warranty at an extra cost Looking for a more refined economy car  Check out my review on the    a href content 74102312580

Neg, I recently went out and test drove one of these puppies  and here are a few random thoughts I had from this experience In the event of a head on collision  the car s engine is designed to separate for the car s frame and drop to the ground  I guess consumers don t take too highly to being crushed by the engine It s a snug fit  There is very little space between the seat and the door  The armrest is a stand alone console between the driver and passenger seats  and has a good amount of storage space for CDs and other things The back seat has very little legroom  and is a bit cramped  Even if the front seat person moves the seat forward  very little room is yielded   There are special child seat restraints and three seatbelts in the back  Not exactly a huge family vehicle  but equipped with child safety locks  and other amenities Really good power  for such a tiny little car  Surprising  in fact  You step on the gas pedal  and it moves  Handles very good around corners Speaking of corners  what is that loud clicking sound  Oh It s just the turn signal  I guess Ford wants to help eliminate those annoying motorists who drive 6 miles down the road before realizing their blinker has been on the whole time  Since the turn signal is about as loud as a Mark McGwire home run swat  I would say they are well on their way to accomplishing this goal All the doors automatically lock once the car exceeds 5 MPH Very good vision when driving  You cannot see the hood of the car  The wind shield affords a wide view  There is a moderate amount of noise  and you may have to turn up the radio just a bit when accelerating to higher speeds The clutch is very easy to push down on  and transitioning from one gear to other is very smooth with the exception of reverse  It was quite a task to put the vehicle in reverse  You almost have to lift up on the gear stick  It took about a minute and a half to figure this out the first time  and about 30 45 seconds to do each time after that There is no RPM gauge  Only this annoying light that comes on  telling you when to shift up or down  and usually at the slightest amount of acceleration  I guess Ford thinks I m not smart enough to know when to shift The car gets pretty good gas mileage  at 25 34 MPG  but I would expect more from such a small car This car has a lot of truck space  although its much longer than it is deep  When loading the truck  you really have to come forward into the trunk  rather than placing objects down into it  There is a hatch release lever inside that  VERY useful if you are ever car jacked  and forced into the trunk  while the robber makes his getaway  The back seats also pull down in a 1 3  2 3 configuration for added capacity Overall this is not a bad car  but at a price of about 17 grand  it is WAY over priced  I see this car as the exact duplicate of what the Escort used to be when it first came out  If you are looking for a car that will get you to where you re going  then this will do  But the price tag is just offensive  and was the main reason we did not buy  
Neg, I bought this car right after 9 11 out of a misguided attempt to show patriotism  After being treated poorly by the VW and Honda dealers despite driving up in a brand new Saab wagon and willing to pay cash  the ford dealer was actually the only place willing to deal  That was where the good part of the ownership experience ended  I have had 13 unscheduled service visits to three different ford dealers in the 16 000 miles I have driven since recieveing my car with 4 miles on the odomometer  That does not include 2 cracked windshields due to a faulty design on the windscreen roof intersection  The stereo still does not work other then presets 1 and 6 on fm2 despite 3 fixes and one replacement  and this is only true when the faceplate does not pop off the radio over any pothole or expansion joint  The alignment is continuously in need of adjustment  the air conditioner refuses to work  the trunk will not stay shut unless slammed so hard that your hand is bruised by the awful spoiler that I ordered my car without  The stablility control does not consistantly work to the parameters specified by ford but no fualt can ever be found  until 36000 miles rolls around  the engine will run for 3 seconds with the clutch in  having been at idle and the key out of the ignition  the clutch slips already due to the perevious problem  the parking brake does not work even on slight hills and the car will not always engage first gear when shut off due to the running engine problem  There are numerous rattles in a car where the only thing that is in it most times is the rubberized owners manual  The windshield wiper wear out in 2 months  the defroster and demister are not up to even Virginia winters  and the heated mirrors don t work at all  The rear seatbacks will not consistatly lock upright  and the automatic power window can no longer be overridden  the fix would involve a new door or complete disasembly which would yield more rattles  I average 21 3 mpg in maily highway drving with the occasional trip to the golf course or store  This is due to the lack of a sixth gear which causes the engine to run at 3400 3800 rpm at cruising speeds on our higher speed interstates in the south  The paint is easily damaged  and the headlights are basically ineffective on the lowbeam setting  The seats are uncomfortable  engine harsh  clutch downright wierd in it s action  shift light annoining and it s use will yield a stall in most instances  The traction control does not work and in snow actually needs to be defeated in order to be able to start forward motion  it locks the drive wheels and digs them in to the snow when there is some freeze up overnight  and the ford ski rack is awful  The dealer service for the ford is abismal at all locations  and loaner cars for major waranty repairs that take days are non existant even at the selling dealer  a  blue oval  one at that  My friend with a 1985 Volvo 240 with 300 000 miles on the origonal engine  transmission  clutch  and belts will not drive my car due to the reliablilty issues and feeling of driving around in a tin can  Her car has a rear door held to the car and hinges by duct tape and bondo  And the  leather wraped steering wheel  must be covered with bionic cow hide  
Neg, I bought my 1992 Ford Aerostar used in March 1993 with 42k miles on it  It was an XLT extended model  with the 3 0 V6  It did not have dual air conditioning and that was a big mistake  The a c could not keep the large van cool in the summer no matter what  The van was bought to haul Civil Air Patrol search and rescue teams as well as an Explorer scout post  It was an excellent road vehicle  very comfortable for long distance driving  Problems began to appear with the fiberglass tailgate cracking at 50k miles  The door glass would rattle when you shut the doors  and the sliding door leaked badly  The side windows leaked despite being replaced twice by the dealer  The carpet was threadbare by 75k miles but to be fair  that wasn t helped by carrying people and cargo constantly Mechanical repairs were very frequent  with the dreaded Ford ECM IV ignition module having to be replaced every 30k miles  By the time I sold the van at 103k miles  it was on its third alternator  second water pump  third power steering pump  and the transmission was slipping  This was after exclusive highway driving  not much stop and go city driving  The van sheetmetal was very prone to dents  with the large flat sides not having much reinforcement  For some reason the headlights could never maintain a proper adjustment either  By 103k miles the 3 0  Vulcan  V6 was burning oil  I tried to maintain this van to the factory guidelines and changed oil every 3000 miles but it just kept breaking down  The power steering pump moaned and groaned constantly  which apparently is a common Ford problem  The engine in these vans is VERY difficult to access and work on for you do it yourselfers out there be forewarned  One thing that I did like was the rather low lift over height compared to fullsize vans and the Chevy Astro  Not as low to the ground as a Dodge Caravan but close  The rear seats are really darned heavy  close to 100 pounds and require 2 people to remove  The velour upohlstery is a lint and dog hair magnet which never ever comes clean  All types of clothing stick to the seats from static electricity The exhaust system lasted 50k miles exactly  I had it replaced twice with factory Ford parts  a bit disappointing on the quality there  Brakes  The Aerostar will eat a set of front brake pads every 30k miles  almost as bad as a full size van  As far as driving it  the steering is responsive  the brakes are a bit soft but the ABS worked very well  Acceleration isn t bad with the 3 0 but I wish it had the 4 0   The gauges are large and easy to read and the controls are decent except for the power window and door locks  which are right next to your knee and you will often hit them when you least expect it   I m a big person so maybe it s just me  The factory radio has a decent tape player but a horrible FM  Spend the   and get an aftermarket radio on all Fords  Dealer service wasn t bad  just expensive  There is a dealer here in Louisville  KY that sells Ford trucks vans exclusively and they know their stuff  very honest  The other dealers  repairs were okay but they were pretty uncaring especially on warranty repairs  I used to be a volunteer firefighter  and this is not a good vehicle to run code 3 with due to the soft brakes and extreme body roll  plus difficult blindspot vision  In the rain I never felt really safe making a hard emergency run with the Aerostar  Just my  02 cents worth if you happen to use your vehicle for that purpose  Overall  the Aerostar was so so  It was slightly more reliable than my 1990 Taurus  which was the worst thing I ve ever driven  
Neg, I NEVER owned an American Car  I bought this 1998 Ford ZX2 because my 25 year old son decided to work for a Ford Dealership and A  he gave me a great price and B  I didn t want his boss to think he couldn t sell a car to his own mother  I ve had it a year and half now and I have to say that I wish I had my Mazda Protege back  Not that I ve had any problems with it so far but the biggest problem has been the NOISE  It is LOUD  Between the road noise and the air conditioner I have to turn the radio to dangerous levels to hear the music  And speaking of the sound system   radio cassette  well  I ve heard much better  It just doesn t have any pizzazz  The engine runs hard  Even when I m in 5th gear   manual  I find myself re shifting and trying to get into a higher gear because it sounds as if the engine is laboring  About 3 days after I got the car  I spent about an hour looking for the trunk release button  I finally figured out that there wasn t any  The only way to open the trunk was either with the key or with the remote trunk release button  Except  both methods require that the ignition be turned off unless you use a second key  So that when I drop my partner off at the airport  I can t open the trunk to remove the luggage with the car running Also  it s supposed to be a 12 gallon gas tank but I feel like I m at the gas station all the time  The car is cramped in front  I m 5 4 quot  and I have to pull the seat up pretty far in order to reach the pedals  but the further you sit up  the closer your head is to the sun visors  They seem to be right in my face I don t know  It s not a BAD car really  but all in all it s pretty much a car that even a mother couldn t love     
Neg, I bought a 98 Ford Escort sedan brand new  It was a nice looking car  and was affordable for me  a divorced mother  It had all the important options available  had four doors  and was easy to handle on the road  I loved the Escort s appearance  the sound system  I had the Premium Sound option  and the comfort of the seats  I hated the leaky trunk  I took that car in every few months to have the trunk fixed  but still ended up with a moldy trunk  moldy stroller  and nowhere to put my groceries if I wanted them to stay dry  After eighteen months of repairing the trunk without positive outcome  I finally talked Ford into helping me into another car  They would only help me out of the still topsy turvy loan if I went into another Ford  I did so  but NOT an Escort again  I am too afraid that I ll end up with another unrepairable leaky trunk  That brings me to the biggest problem with Escorts  Anyone knowledgeable about the auto market will tell you that they do not hold their value well they are a dime a dozen  Driving my Escort never gave me too much trouble  even in snow  It was easy to steer  inexpensive to maintain  was good on gas  and still looked nice  Its the perfect car for anyone wanting a new  comfortable car for a decent price  Just watch the trunk br br  
Neg, This was the first car I got when I turned 16  and I haven t liked it one bit since then  Sure it s cheap  and it gets good gas mileage  but it is not comfortable and does not handle well under bad conditions  This past winter I went out one day to go get some baby food for the new baby while my mom was still at work  it was snowing out but I thought nothing of it at the time  No more then 1000 feet away from my house I go to hit the brakes  and they lock up as my car goes sliding into a ditch  The back seats in this car are very uncomfortable also  I recently was going to take it on a trip to Niagra Falls  about a 3 hour drive  but decided against it because anyone in the backseat would be very uncomfortable the whole ride  I wish I could trade it in and get a new car br br  
Neg, My ZX2  I have had mine ZX2 for a little over 2 years and less than 25 000 miles  I have disliked it greatly from the get go  EXTERIOR I really like the exterior  It is sleek and a little stylish  A 2 door coupe with a little attitude INTERIOR A lot left to be desired  The dash is cool but impractical  There is no easy way to upgrade the stereo or any other in dash component since it comes in that nice oval box  The cup holders are good for small drinks  They are not good for the standard 32oz fast food drink  Large cups hit the controls for the AC  The interior is a little cramped feeling if there is more than the driver in the car  The back seat is impossible to get in and out of  On the plus side the back seat is roomy The center console is small and does not hold CDs very well  The door pockets are small and pathetic  The ZX2 does leave a lot to hope for in the way of storage inside the car PERFORMANCE The ZX2 has a lot of get up and go  This will be great for you if you do mind feeling like you are riding a tightly bound rubber band  The gear shift has also been stiff and unmanageable  It has just gotten worse after time  It is very difficult to go into reverse  COMPLAINTS I have had a lot of problems with this car  The brakes continually popping even after that got replaced twice  The door seals and trunk seals leaking  have fixed fixed only a dozen times so far  If you drive the car with any speed the gas mileage is much less than the sticker claims it should be  On top of this everything seems to rattle  I have never had such a loud little car  Overall I would not suggest the ZX2  May be it has gotten better since 1998  I did get one of the originals  It was only on the lot about 1 2 a day before I bought it     
Neg, I purchased this vehicle brand new in 1998  when it had about 40 miles on it  It was in the shop within the first week  with rattling noises coming from under the hood and the emergency brake light wouldn t go off  Just recently  I was rear ended at a stop sign  The rear bumper of my Escort was completely totalled  and there was damage to the frame of the car as well  The person that hit me suffered only a broken headlight  She probably hit me at about 20 mph  but her car miraculously did not sustain the kind of damage as my Escort did  For the external damages  repair estimates are  700  They haven t taken the car apart yet to determine the estimate to repair the frame of the car  You would think that a car could handle a crash of this speed without too much damage  but it wasn t the case  The body of the car was found to be pretty weak in this kind of crash  Suffice it to say  I will not be purchasing another Escort  I don t feel safe in it at all UPDATE  This crash was at 15 mph  and the damage ended up costing over  1 000  Thankfully the other driver was insured and I didn t have to pay for it     
Neg, I bought the 1998 Ford Escort Sedan Sport when I moved out of state for law school  Needing a mode of transportation  I opted to buy an inexpensive car to use for the 3 years while I was away at school instead of driving my family car back and forth across the country each term At the time of my purchase  the economy was still strong and not many car dealers in Southern California were willing to sell their cars at a discount price  Mitsubishi wanted  16K for their Mirage  Toyota wanted  17K for a Corolla  Honda wanted  16K for a Civic and even Chevrolet wanted  16K for a Prism  It was insane  I definitely did not want to spend more than  15K for a  point A to point B  car  So finally  I saw a brand new 1998 Escort Sedan Sport on  sale  at the local Ford dealer for a little less than  15K Anyway  the first month of driving my car  I thought that there was something wrong with the car  In Southern California  there is a LOT of highway driving  even for short distances  I was having problems accelerating onto the freeway it took me a good minute or two to go from 0 to 60  It was ridiculous  I took the car in and they did a tune up on the car and could not find anything wrong  Apparently the car s acceleration just sucks  Period  There is nothing  Sport  about this car  110 hp  It felt more like 70  My old 90 hp 1985 Oldsmobile Firenza had more pep than this car  I think the 2 door ZX2 s have a better engine and has more pep  but the sedan is very sluggish And being in warm temperatures  if you turn on the air conditioning while the car is climbing uphill forget it  Your car will actually decelerate even with your foot pressing the gas pedal all the way to the floor  Also  if you have 4 adults in the car  forget about trying to accelerate at any good pace  The car will basically be maxed out at about 60 mph without making horrible noises and shaking  even though the speed limit in CA is 65 After about a year of owning this car  the power window started sticking  That had to be replaced  but it was under warranty  Then a few months later  a fan in the air conditioning unit broke and was also replaced under warranty  Also you can t upgrade the stereo on this car unless you buy an expensive adapter harness kit because the stereo is integrated into their heating cooling controls  Who designed this thing All I have to say is that I was very happy when I graduated law school and sold this car  I had it listed in the paper and auto trader for WEEKS before it sold for a couple thousand below blue book  
Neg, We got our second escort a few years ago  but i m not exactly sure why  They are very light  but the engines are not very strong  If you get four or five full grown people in the car  it definately struggles going up big hills  It seems very much like a golf cart in the way that it feels and drives  It zooms around town and handles well  but it isn t anything special  some of the advantages are that it is very reasonably priced and it has very good gas efficiency so it is pretty cheap to keep running  This car is good for someone in a city who will not have much to lug around nor have many passengers to drive around     
Neg, I bought this vehicle when my last car died I probably should have spent more time researching the car and the dealership but I needed a car  My last car was a used one so I figured that this time I would go ahead and spend the extra money and buy a new one  Worst mistake of my life  I had picked the car up with only 3 miles on it from the dealership  miles from my test drive It was in the shop within a week from when I purchased the vehicle  It was a 5 speed standard I had just thought that it was just a problem with the gears grinding but it turned out to be serious There were problems with the clutch  the transmission the brakes  the radio and the cassette player The dealership that I bought the car from was 45 minutes away so I brought it to the one that was in my city They charged me for looking at my car everything was still under warranty Money that I never saw back I was accused by the other dealership of not knowing how to drive a standard and intentually damaging my new vehicle  NO one goes out and buys a brand new standard and not know how to drive one  Needless to say I was considerably unhappy So I contacted the FORD company itself and they weren t any help either they wouldnt replace the car or offer me a discount or even an apology what I got was we have to try to fix the problem first To this day the car still isnt right Last week my heater went out do to a hose coming undone second time its been fixed Something else I found annoying  the bumper is plastic  Back to my other gripes about the car I was way overcharged  I was charged for things that I found out after were supposed to be standard on my car I was charged  25 for a cigarette lighter and ashtray  I don t smoke I was charged extra for the cassette player I was charged extra for the non keyless entry And on top of being charged extra I was told that I had to go through a particular finance company  a whole new problem and since I didn t have a co signer i was charged a few thousand dollars extra My credit report shows a co singer So not only did I not get a good car for a good deal I cant even trade this one in until its payed off and worthless not that it really isn t right now I cant rate this car low enough I would not recommend this car to my worst enemy br br  
Neg, I used to drive a fantastic little 1986 Chevy Nova  A Toyota in a Chevy suit  but it finally got too old and wobbly  I went on line to research replacement cars  I considered the Toyota Corolla  Honda Civic and Ford Focus  but ended up with the Ford ZX2 for a number of reasons When I bought it  it was 2 years old and had 25 000 miles on it  but I got it through the Ford Certified Pre Owned Vehicle web site  It came with a no haggle price of  8 600 and a 12 month warranty  At that price  the best I could do at Toyota was a three year old Corolla with 60 000K My ZX2 is silver and pretty cool and sexy looking for such a cheap car  I drive it back and forth to work every day and cram my two kids in the back at weekends  I get to work much faster now   the car wants me to drive above 80 mph at all times  But at that speed the gas mileage is only about 28 mpg and the car is NOISY  The kids say it s even noisier in the back The car is pretty comfortable for me   I m a medium sized woman   but my 6 4 quot  husband doesn t like to drive it for more than 1 2 hour at a time  And when I had to put a couple of grown men in the back last week  I wasn t sure I d ever get them back out I think the trunk is generous and the cup holders are fine  but the glove box is way too small   once you put the owner s manual in there  you only have room for three cassettes and a Kleenex I ve had the car for a year  and once last year some kind of pin in the axle or wheel fell out   I ground to a halt and had to get towed  but they fixed it for free and that s the only problem I ve had br br  
Neg, I bought my ford Tempo about two years ago   Since then it has driven 20 000 miles more or less   I bought this car because I needed a car to commute 50 miles to school in   So after some haggling my father bought me my Ford Tempo GL at a used car lot   My car has not given me as much trouble as I thought it was going to   So far I have replaced the alternator   the brakes   the battery and done basic maitanence   I hope that this car will hold out for another year   but that is not guaranteed   I feel like a ton of things are about to wrong with it   I recommend this car to commuters on a budget   I do not recommend this car if you want to pick up chicks   its not a very attractive car        
Neg, IS THIS SUV FOR YOU The older style Ford Bronco  1966 1977  is most suitable for someone who has a working knowledge about cars is prepared to do a little maintenance  This car makes a better hobby than daily driver  However  there is plenty of room and it is very simple under the hood so it is a good car to learn on if you are not confident with your automotive abilities  It s a great attention getter on the street and performs very well off road  It can weave through narrow obstacles yet has a long enough wheel base that it isn t too  quot squirelly quot  on the road  It is nice because the hard top is removable  but very heavy  and can provide the open air feeling of a convertible  Original equipment  especially body panels  can be a challenge to find for a decent price but there are many after market products available if you d like to modify it  In my opinion  the model fills the void between a jeep and full size SUV  WHAT DO I LOOK FOR WHEN BUYING AN OLDER BRONCO  It depends on what you d like to use it for  If you have any intention at all of  quot fixing it up quot  one day  the most important thing you can look for is a rust free body  Body panels are expensive and tough to find  A good rule of thumb is to check the floorboards under drivers feet   if they are rusted through move on to another vehicle  Be aware that many people put sheet metal over the rusted area to cover it here  If you are looking to use it off road make sure to buy one with the Dana 44 in the front end and  quot large bearing quot  rear end  all models came with a Ford 9 inch rear end  The large bearing has stouter brake drums and wheel bearings  Many models came with a Dana 30 front end  The Dana 30 has many drawbacks  parts are hard to find  it s unique to Broncos  it is more costly to upgrade to disk brakes  and they are not as strong  However  the Dana 30 is sufficient for daily driving and occasional off road use  The other main consideration is power steering and power brakes   these options were primarily available on the 1973 1977 models  There are many after market kits you can buy to upgrade to these options but these are pricey and can be tedious to install  I see non power assisted Broncos as being better for off road use because there are fewer things that can break off road and leave you stranded  However  daily street driving is compromised without these luxuries  especially if you install larger tires  A Bronco with power steering and power brakes will bring a premium  Finally  you ll probably want a Bronco that has an automatic transmission   even if you us it off road  The manual transmission equipped on Broncos was a 3 speed  on the steering column  and it often has inoptimal gearing for driving off road  There are many after market adapters available for upgrading to a 4 speed manual transmission from an older Ford truck but his can  again  be pricey and a tedious conversion If you want power  find one with a Ford 302 cubic inch engine  Not only is this a V 8 but the components allow for the  quot bolt in quot  addition of a Ford 351 Windsor motor if the 302 is not enough for you In summary  the premium Bronco will have a no rust  Dana 44  large bearing  12 inch brake drum v s  10 inch  power steering and power brakes  automatic transmission and a 302 cubic inch motor  If you want to own the Bronco that everyone will envy and will be less costly to upgrade or restore in the future  don t buy one without these options  However  if you have a specific use you plan on using your Bronco for  buy the one that will best suit your needs  WHAT ARE THE PROS OF OWNING AN OLDER BRONCO Every other Bronco owner you meet will wave at you  it s almost like joining an elite club  They perform very well off road  especially with the right modifications  After market components are abundant  You get a lot of attention driving these cars  They are fairly simple under the hood and are practical to fix off road and under poor conditions  The front and rear drive lines are interchangable in case one is damaged  There are many after market parts available  They are a very fun SUV   and one of the first ever made  There is ample sheet metal and provide great protection in an accident but make sure a roll bar is installed  WHAT ARE THE CONS They are expensive to maintain  especially if you take them off road  Even thought hey have a longer wheelbase than a jeep they still have a stiff ride on the highway  Expect  quot bump steer quot   steering wheel will move when you hit a bump  especially if you own one with no power steering and larger tires  Body parts are scarce  They are prone to rolling over under extreme driving circumstances   Never drive one without a roll bar     
Neg, Being a mechanic by nature my first reaction to this suv is to stay away from it and I will tell you why  First and most importantly to me is what this vehicle holds in store for me or any consumer how much will it cost for repairs Large or small   well i will tell you that if properly maintained you will get a long life out of these but  when it comes time for suspension work or even exhaust work you can expect a large bill when the work is complete and the garage has had your suv for the whole day  Suspension parts wear quickly on these for some reason weather or not you take care of them  For instance the ball joints and tie rods are non greaseable and weather or not you go off road with this you will need to replace them Generally at about 40k miles  If you were to replace all 4 ball joints on this vehicle be prepared to spend between 300 and 400 dollars  In My opinion these parts should last at least 50k maybe even 60k if the vehicle is well maintained  Exhaust repair will end up costing you about 200 00 due to rotting tail pipes and mufflers   at least in this part of the country  On the plus side of this vehicle is its handling and fuel economy and the comfort level is high I just dont like to repair suspension that soon and if you put off repairing the suspension remember your tires are next  Over all with its decent fuel economy and roomyness it is an ok vehicle  my personal Preferance is the chevy s series in my experience these vehicles last longer     
Neg, What you are about to read is based on my recent test drive of the 2004 Ford Escape  We went to our local Ford Dealer to see if anything had changed between the 2003 model and the 2004  Unfortunately  very little changed  It is still a 4X4 Minivan  in fact the only visible change we noticed is that the limited edition Escapes were a bit cheaper than the previous year  Down about  1000 dollars depending on what options you choose Once I first got in the vehicle I did feel alot of comfort and room  After checking out my surroundings I did notice that the head room was incredible the Front Head room is 40 4 in  and the Rear head room is 39 2 in  The seats are very comfortable  but pretty boring in styling  they were just a plain tan color just average  The seats are very easy to fold down and add extra cargo space once layed flat After a couple minutes sitting in the Escape  I really felt as if I was in a Dodge Caravan of the late 80 s  It just has the feel of a mini van  I was very disappointed with the center console  it is nothing more than a huge pit  There is nothing there to really hold any Cd s  spare change  whatever it may be  It was basically a 2nd glove box  It is excellent storage for whatever you may keep in there  it is just not designed to hold anything imparticular  The dashboard is pretty basic and boring  nothing really sticks out Once I started the car up I could tell the power of the engine  201 HP  kinda roared once I starting it up  Upon trying to put the vehicle in drive I noticed that the gear selector is on the column  Didn t we phase this out yet  very outdated  Once I left the lot  I noticed right away that the engine had zip  but was noticeably louder than other vehicles  The vehicle has excellent pick up  Pulling out was very simple and the car like handling is a plus The Escape I drove had very few options  basically a stripped model with floor mats  and mud guards  The options it did have like power windows  power door locks  etc  were all placed basically the same place as any other vehicle  and they are all within comfortable reach of the driver  Radio had some definite volume  but you need to so you can hear music over the road noise  More engine noise on city streets  but once you get on the highway the road noise kind of drowns out the engine noise Once I finally got on the highway and pulled out on the on ramp  I was ready to take the car back to the dealer  The engine though peppy is extremely loud as well as the road noise of the vehicle  I found myself talking much louder than normal to be able to communicate with my passenger  Very disappointing with the road noise  but speed and handling were very nice  More car like than most SUV s The 2004 Ford Escape is pretty basic  and a little bit boring  The V 6 Engine had more than enough power  but they need to build something around it  Car like handling is a plus  but the interior needs to be more quiet  Road noise isn t a big deal when you drive alone  but once you have friends and family in the vehicle it can be down right annoying SUMMARY It is definitely one of the lower priced 4X4 vehicles  but there are other options out there  I would suggest looking to other makes and models  As the salesman told me  All the fathers are buying these for their daughters  So maybe the road noise is an outta sight outta mind kinda thing  Good luck in your SUV searches  
Neg, I bought this vehicle for the room that it has  Seats 7 with extra room in the back for anything else you need to carry  What i learned and know hate about this vehicle is the sliding door  I have had the door into ford a least a dozen times in the past year  The top roller on the door pops out and the door is just hanging there  It makes it unable to close or open properly  It would seem to me that this should make the car unable to be drivable but as long as they fix it and it runs a month before it falls off again then it s ok  In the mean time it is a pain and a hassle  I would think that they could bond it or make it fixed permantly  but that does not seem to be the case  Beware drivers who are thinking of buying a mini van with a slider Just had to take it to the shop march 8th 2000  the hinesville ford department and the body shop that they contracted have finally told me that there is nothing else they can do  They have replaced everything on the door except for the door itself  Now what do I do  I have to carry a cresent wrench with sockets every where I go My warranty has expired Now  and they have made sure that I have gone over the miles that they warrany there work  Basically I got taken big  I want to warn every owner  Make sure you get paper work for all the work that is done  Even if there shop fixed it at there expense  It is the only proof that you ever brought it back to there shop If any one has a suggestion please leave me a comment  If you know how to get out of a contract let me know I still owe 2 more years of payments on this vehicle br br  
Neg, If this car was an actual human  instead of zero to sixty  she would be doing ten to twenty for attempted vehicular manslaughter    quot Vickey quot i  is the unoriginal  informal name that my 1991 LTD LX earned  Before I describe the attack  here is the  quot fun stuff quot   What s under the hood b This matrix grilled  built like a tank  rear wheel drive  body on frame Ford is massive  Accordingly  the power plant is larger than most engines in cars on the road For those of you who do not know what a 302 5 0 EFI V 8 is  let me explain  for those of you who do  please skip to  the next section    quot 5 0 EFI V 8 quot i  means this engine is suitable for Mustangs  and cop cars  EFI means electronic fuel injection and V 8 means it is one the biggest engines on the road  It is the same engine that is in a Ford Mustang  and everybody knows that these are not slow  Police require cars that can catch even the fastest of automobiles  and this is why many police departments choose the Crown Victoria as their squad cars   The next section  I will try to get all this technical information out of the way so we can get to the good stuff  The following sections are for people who are thinking about buying a 1991 Crown Victoria   or a Mercury Grand Marquis and for people who have this large barge  Knowing that for most people who are reading this neither apply  I will try to keep it as brief as possible  However  I do have an abundance of information that I will try to shoehorn between now and the attack b You look young for a grandfather b The 1991 model is the last of the old school Crown Victorias  The more contemporary model arrived in early 1991 as 1992 s  You have seen the ones I am talking about  they look like a mixologist put a 1991 Crown Victoria in a blender with a Taurus  giving it a more rounded off appearance  The previous generation before the 1992 s had not changed that much in looks since 1979  yes the late 70 s  I feel this has a causal effect on the company grandpa car image that this car has  The split bench seats perpetuate this image b I see  in your past  problems when ordering at the drive through b Would you like some information that is very useful at cocktail parties  Any Crown Victoria owner  all models up to 1999  has probably had problems with the power windows and I am no exception  However  I fixed it myself  so I can give you additional information that others cannot  The power windows use a nylon spool that breaks and tangles around the regulator and motor inside the door  The local Ford dealer wanted  250 to fix my drivers side window  so I fixed it myself with a part from an extra door  see  When Cars Attack  section  This was a hassle  but creates less anxiety than handing a cop your licence and insurance information through the back window  not to mention talking to customs when driving to Montreal  do it through your back window  and you are sure to be asked to  pull to da side  Now  if you meet someone at a cocktail party with a Crown Victoria you can magically predict that they have had problems with their windows b Jiffy lube this  buddy b Vickey had greaseable upper control arm bushings  This is a nice feature  however it is really hard to find a service station that will do it for you The wheels must be turned to access the zerk fittings  meaning two more steps for the people who service your car Make sure that someone does this at least ever two years  at the absolute most  or you will have an expensive repair b Other problem spots  For every single mile I put on this car  80 000  I had problems with the EGR passages  EGR stands for exhaust gas recirculation  which sounds good on paper  but means big problems for people who have to get their exhaust checked upon inspection  EGR runs your exhaust back through your engine to burn some of the pollutants that otherwise would be released into the air  and if it is not working  you will not pass emissions The air conditioning uses R 12 refrigerant which is no longer being manufactured  It is still available at a current rate of  25 30 per pound  To recharge  five pounds of R 12 is utilized You do the math  it isn t cheap Neither is the alternative  You can convert your Crown Victoria to the new R 134A refrigerant at a cost of  200 300 which includes parts and labor Other problems include  but are not limited to  the alternator and the windshield wiper pump  not to mention the imprecise suspension  Vicky consumed alternators like a monkey eats bananas For the love of God  if you have this car  track all parts you buy for it  It is a good idea to ask to see the used parts  on any car  before work starts on it  even if you have no idea what the part is b Use the force  Luke b Being from Vermont  it is hard not to be a red neck when dealing with cars  but it is a constant battle  As you can tell  sometimes the urges are too strong to win the altercation  That is why I installed a K amp N air filter in my car  This is a highly crafted air filter that is reusable  Just wash it  oil it  put it back in  and enjoy the extra horsepower you now have  In retrospect  this was a sound investment  I also installed  underdrive pulleys  in my Crown Victoria  which replaces the water pump and alternator pulleys with ones that  underdrive  several of the accessories  freeing up engine horsepower  I know you are thinking this is why I had to replace the alternator often  three times  however two of them happened before I made this adjustment  so I ruled out this assumption After these two simple adjustments  I realized I did not need to change the muffler to a high performance one  as so many people do when trying to get more horsepower out of their car This car was very fast  advancing from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 10 seconds before the adjustments and 8 seconds after  However  the acceleration of this car is more noticeable at highway speeds  where these adjustments had the most impact  On the highway this car is a bad boy b When Cars Attack  I know your eyes are getting blurry  and if I haven t lost you so far  I thank you for reading Please let me conclude with this story  After calling AAA once my car would not start  they sent a tow truck to tell me some misinformation  He said it was one thing  and I found out it was another problem  down the road  I found out the complication the hard way  It was a bone chilling morning  10 degrees  in Vermont  and I went out to start Vickey so she could warm up  and I could get my things together inside the house I started the car  got out and shut the door The previous night I pulled up close to the garage  so I had to walk behind it on my way inside  Just as I did  the reverse lights illuminated and it lunged toward me  As I jumped to the side  it slowed down enough for me to open the passenger side door I realized the wheels had been turned to the left  making the car continue to come toward me  After I opened the door  my self preservation function kicked in  and I decided to spring away and I watched as she drove down my driveway I cannot describe the feeling of watching your car drive without a driver  Just as Vickey completed a 90 degree angle  the passenger side door caught on a metal fence  twisting it to touch my front quarter panel As it scraped along the diamond metal fence  it straightened out and proceeded to travel down my driveway Just imagine the next time you start your car  what would happen if you turned your steering wheel all the way to the left  shifted into reverse  and let go of the break  Now  picture what would happen to someone if they happened to be standing to the right side of your car  As I watched Vicky drive away  sparking along the fence  she slammed against the last metal pole on the fence  and with a brief upward motion  she rested at her final destination  To make things worse  I had just replaced that door after getting broadsided  with no injury to my passenger  by a Grand am  I put the original door on it after pounding it out  and sold it at auction for  200  Good riddance     
Neg, This is essentially a re hash of the Crow Vic opinion that I wrote earlier I was driving a 1987 Honda CRX that was about to die  and needed something quickly  so I hit a dealer specializing in used police cars figuring I d get something inexpensive and interesting  I picked up a 1991 police package  formerly owned by the Connecticut state police Since the car was only going to be driven a few hundred miles a week  price was the main concern When the car was running  it was a lot of fun  Good acceleration  lots of  quot luxury quot  features that the Honda didn t have  but it lacked cruise control  so long drives were tiring  and dangerous if there were too many radar traps  Because of the size of the car and the engine  it was easy to creep up to 85 MPH  I did get interesting responses from other drivers  and didn t have to wait behind someone to get out of the passing lane  Unfortunately  the bad outweighed the good The police package was the only Crown Vic in 1991 with a carburetor Not only was it a carburetor  but an engineering nightmare known as a variable venturi  The one I had was going bad  The local Ford dealer wouldn t touch it  saying that the best that they could do was replace it  at a cost of  1100  I did manage to find a mechanic who specialized in them and only charged  500 to rebuild the one I had Eventually  all of the major systems on the car were replaced  one at a time  just to keep the car operating  It is also the last year for the 351 CUI engine When it was running  the handling wasn t particularly good  the breaking was poor  and the ride was soft  I can t even imagine what a standard Crown Vic would drive like  The acceleration was awesome  but at less then 20 miles per gallon  stepping on the gas was an expensive proposition If you re looking for an inexpensive luxury car  don t stop off at the local used police car salesman  The sticker price isn t even close to what it will cost in the end br br  
Neg, Well  on a road trip to St  George  Utah I rode in one for 5 hours on each trip  there and back  It was a base model F 150 with a stick and base wheels and no rear bumper The ride was pretty smooth  The suspension was really soft  I don t think this one was made for towing or heavy duty work  The interior however  wasn t very roomy and comfortable  The seats were rigid and not very comfortable As for speed  it was fairly good at keeping its momentum on hills although it did lose some speed  I think it would keep its speed better than most other cars with less than 200 horse power  It wasn t that great on acceleration with the manual gearbox The transmission was not very nice either  When you shift it and let the clutch out it jerks the truck no matter how smoothly you perform it  It is also geared way too high  It can t put any power to the wheels when it needs it like in acceleration If you are going to buy a new F 150 then get the one with bucket seats  automatic transmission  stiff suspension and a towing package  That way you will get some torque going to the wheels when you want it  The bucket seats would make it a more enjoyable ride  The Chevrolet and GMC seem to ride more smoothly and be able to take more heavy duty work br br  
Neg, I owned the truck for almost 2 years then I sold it  Mechanically the truck felt good  allthought it lacked a little bit of power and was bad on gas  I would go for the 5 4 next time  I loved the truck it had a great ride for a large truck  I had the off road package which gave it bigger tires and higher suspension  But the overall quality was not good  Under 2 years old and the truck was rusting in many different spots  This was not just mine doing it  I talked to many other owners that had the same problems  Also the sheetmetal on the doors cracked and the paint chipped off  this happened around the window frame  and this is on every 1997 and up f 150  I also read they are having paint problems like they did in the early 90 s paint on the top surfaces are letting go  Not happy with the quality and was worried about the future of this truck  Since I did not lease  I financed I did not want to own a beat up old truck after 2 years or so br br  
Neg,  SHO  is supposed to stand for  super high output  I personally wouldn t call 235 HP from a 3 4 liter DOHC V8  super high output  but I guess Ford thinks thought it was worthy of the name  Its 235 horsepower V8 and good road manners means that this Ford can almost hang  in out right performance  with the finest sedans from its European and Japanese rivals  such as the BMW 325i and the Acura Legend i Driving Impressions i  The latest  SHO  is much more manageable to drive than the original models  Although sadly to say  much slower  and nowhere near as fun  Unfortunately the SHO is FWD  RWD with an added traction control would have been a nice feature  The  suspension  set up provides a comfortable highway ride  while keeping the car flat through fast turns  letting you really enjoy this small V8  The only problem here is that rattles seem to be abundant throughout the cabin over slight bumps  or at high speeds  Throttle response is good  and there is power all the way up to the 6 800 RPM  red line  It can go 0 100 MPH in less than 22 seconds  according to specs   whoopi di woooo  you might say  but this is very fast for a family sedan costing less than  35 000 for the  98 model year   L ike the SHO s first V6 engine  the 3 4 liter  all alloy  60 degree V8 is a collaboration between Ford and Yamaha  Each concentrates on its own strengths  so Ford builds the bottom end  with balancer shaft to keep it smooth at high RPM  which is then shipped to Japan for the 4 valve per cylinder Yamaha twin over head cam heads to be fitted  Although torque peaks at 4 800 RPM  70  is available at an almost idle 1 200 RPM   U nlike Ford s other V8 powered cars  the SHO has its engine mounted transversely  and driving the front wheels  It does this through a 4 speed fully automatic transmission  Unfortunately A manual is not available The two electronically controlled shocks and multi link rear  suspension  give relatively good handling  Despite being an all alloy engine  the 3 4 is heavier than the previous  before  96  3 0 and 3 2 220 horsepower engines i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  of the Taurus SHO is quite luxurious  The comfortable interior is designed to compete with rivals from BMW and Audi  Sorry Ford  but the SHO does not compete in this category if you ask me  The plastics in the SHO are of marginal quality  and the seating feels cheap  and offers nowhere near as much support as the seats in the BMW 325i  The SHO does however have good ergonomics  and tons of standard amenities  power sunroof  power door locks etc  comes with an ice cold AC  and power seats with lumbar support i Exterior Innovation i  Some say this car is  smooth and sleek  I say the SHO s  exterior  design looks more like a big  egg on wheels than anything else  This design never grew on me  in fact  on the contrary I disliked it the more I saw it  The only thing this car has going for in the looks department is the dual exhaust  Ford has changed this design for the 2000 model year  unfortunately the SHO trim line did not return  making the regular 200 horsepower 3 0 Duratec V6 the top of the line power plant i Pricing i  The  price  is getting pretty low for these cars  Nobody really wanted the SHO beings that the competiton offered much more value  i e  the Grand Prix GTP  These cars are not  that fast  they have good  but not spectacular interiors  downright ugly exterior looks  they get relatively poor gas mileage  are not on the top of the list for reliable cars  yet Ford has the audacity to stick a  31 000 dollar price tag on it  I don t blame the public for not wanting to pay that price  A 1998 model however now can be found for around  14 000 or less  typical Ford Taurus resale value i Conclusion i  Because of the poor resale of the 98 Taurus SHO these cars are now an exceptional buy  If you are looking for a cheap family sedan on the used market the Taurus SHO does offer good bang for the buck b Other Cars To Consider b i 1  Chevy Monte Carlo  a href content 61018443396 http www epinions com content 61018443396 a   MY Review 2  Chevy Lumina Z34 3  BMW 328i 4  Saab 9000 Aero 5  Dodge Stratus 6  Dodge Intreped 7  Ford Thunderbird V8 8  Mercury Cougar 9  Toyota Camry V6 10  Honda Accord V6 Coupe  Happy Car shopping  
Neg, Preface In August 1998  I was driving my one month old Pontiac Grand Prix GTP Daytona 500 Pace Car  please read my review on that  when some bozo in a Honda Accord pulled out in front of me  I was NOT happy  Nobody was hurt seriously  I broke his car literally in two  His insurance paid for the  12 000 repair to the front end of my limited edition car  I ll bet they were really happy with him  His insurance also paid for a rental while my car was in the shop  from September 2 to December 15   no joke  This rental car I had was a 1998 Ford Taurus The Taurus Since I had this car for 3 and a half months  I feel kind of like I owned it  Here is what I thought of it The Good What good can I say about this car  Well  for starters  it was fairly comfortable  at least in the 60 40 driver s seat  I say fairly  because even though I ve been much more comfortable in a car  I never got sore during my 35 minute commute each way every day  The wheel and controls were comfortable as well  The gas mileage was pretty good  It was a fairly quiet car  too   pretty solid  and not a lot of wind noise  That surprised me  The car was also easy to maneuver  Not bad for a low end family sedan The Bad I didn t  want  a low end family sedan  I wanted my 240hp loaded out road rocket back  So I always compared it to my car which was slowly coming back together in the shop  In that aspect  the Taurus  weaknesses become very apparent  It is quite weak  That s probably why there s so little wind noise    My Taurus accelerated like a small 4 cylinder despite the fact that it was a 6 cylinder  This was a problem more than once merging on the highway  Even worse   in fact  the  worst  problem I had with this car   was the rear visibility  Three times I almost hit a car coming up on my left  I never rely on mirrors  I always turn my head to look over my shoulder before changing lanes  When I turned my head to look back over my left shoulder  all I could see was the window post  The visibility was terrible  and I advise anyone who has one of these cars to be extra careful when changing lanes  Furthermore  I just didn t care for the styling  The ovoid theme was carried WAY too far  making this car look just as ridiculous inside as outside  The oval radio console must make upgrading the stereo a nightmare  The oval inside door handles were very flimsy The Verdict If you re used to well equipped fast cars  you won t like this one  It ain t  If you re looking for a comfortable family sedan for a fairly inexpensive price  you might want to check it out Oh yeah  and those of you who have Taurus SHOs and think they are fast  well okay  Maybe  That s not what I reviewed  Besides  my GTP will make an SHO look like it s standing still   br br  
Neg,  Strengths   The Taurus has an excellent ride quality  With the upgraded suspension  it takes in bumps smoothly and even corners quite well for a midsized car  The seats are comfortable and well supportive  and the controls  though some looking quite tacky  are in easy reach and easy to use  The gauges are goodsized and understandable  and the overall roominess is great   Weaknesses   It is equipped with the 3 0L Vulcan engine  and there s not too much good I can say about that  First  the car is very underpowered  It doens t even come close to matching the other competitors acceleration figures  Also  under hard acceleration  the engine has noticeable vibration and is quite loud for a supposedly  quot refined quot  V 6  Also  the axle ratio on this car is extremely low  at around 3 90 1  This means it revs really high and not that high of a speed  Also  in overdrive  it hits about 2300 2400 rpm while cruising at 65mph  Our van only does about 1900 2000 at this speed  Also mechanically  I m not to impressed with the transmission on this car  When you accelerate real lazy  it shifts smooth out of first  When you give it about half throttle  it shifts pretty rough  But then  when you floor it  it shifts smooth again  Figure that one out  Also  when it shifts from second to third at no matter what speed  it almost sounds like the engine hesitates before continuting on  Lastly  the design of this model year Taurus is pretty bad  It s way too  quot bubble shaped quot  as my girlfriend says  The circular rear window somewhat hinders rear vision  and the bulge at the top of the doors make it kind of hard to use the side mirrors   Overall   I personally wouldn t really recommend this car to anyone especially if you look at other cars out there in this price range hondas  toyotas  etc  This definately isn t the greatest car Ford has ever built  It somewhat lacks in the quality department  Kind of ironic considering their slogan  quot Quality is Job 1 quot     
Neg, When purchasing a new or used vehicle  one always wants to be as knowledgeable as possible about the options available  However  sometimes no amount of research can prepare you for the treachery that lies ahead  when you make an error purchasing a vehicle  The Ford Taurus is a perfect example of this paradox  When researching this particular vehicle  you will find raving reviews from many reviewers  everyone from housewives to the consumer reports The problem is  or it appears that  generally when a person is attesting to  or commenting on the reliability of a car particularly a new car  it is generally before the problems have taken place The Ford Taurus is relatively pleasing to look at  with it s sporty  areo dynamic design  The interior is very comfortable and roomy  The ride is quiet and smooth  and it generally gets very reasonable fuel mileage  Having all these things going for it however  does not alleviate the frustration of the fact that there have been so many recalls on many different areas of the vehicle  transmission  steering stabilizers  air conditioning  electrical system  etc  that it spends more time in the repair facility than it does in a driveway As well  I was incredibly disappointed and frustrated with the attitude and the lack of concern shown by the Ford Motor Company  when notified of the seemingly chronic problems that arose with the vehicle  Although this vehicle has been rated very highly in the safety tests performed on vehicles in this class  and although it is a pleasing vehicle as far as aesthetics  A consumer would certainly want to take into account the potential lack of reliability  as well as the difficulty in getting the adequate and appropriate service performance from Ford Motor Company that would make this car acceptable to own     
Neg, I originally bought this vehicle because it was well priced and I thought it met all of my needs  As soon as I got it there were problems  Since then  I have been in every two months to have warranty service on the car done  It runs terribly  The car is two years old and it allready needed a new transmission  The car accelerates slowly and is uncomfortable  The engineering is terrible given that the seatbelts bunch up and everything seems to clatter around  As for the positives  the cruise control is easy to use  I would not recomment this car to anyone who plans to drive more then 5 mins a day without having to shoot themselves  I would also not recomment this for someone who does not have 5 hours a week to deal with the warranty service center  or for someone who likes to travel at over 15 miles per hour     
Neg, After having my second child  I wanted a family car so I purchased the Ford Taurus  The car ran fine for the first 2 years  after that it has not been the same  The speedometer  odometer and power steering all went out  It was still under warranty so we took it back to the dealership and they fixed the speedometer  odometer and power steering but now 6 months later it is still not running right  It has trouble shifting from first to second gear and the dealership said they could find nothing wrong with it  That is just the way it runs  If that is the way all Ford Tauruses run  then they have a problem  I do like the roominess of the interior and the trunk  The backseat is large enough that with 2 children  they cannot reach each other with is a plus  The trunk is large enough to fit luggage and a stroller in it  If I just lucked into a bad one in the bunch and they are not all like this then this would be a good car for people with children  If they all run like this  then I would not recommend it br br  
Neg, My dad bought this car used  He paid  15 000 for it  It was used  and had just over 28 000 miles on it  So the price was right  He needed a low mileage vehiclee because he s a salesman and piles on the miles incredibly in this thing  After about 10 months of use  he s already put over 55 000 miles on it  It s been okay so far  but I m hoping he ll replace it really soon and getting something much better like a Buick Regal or something  I almost have him convinced on that car The Taurus is my dad s car  It is equipped with the 3 0L Vulcan engine  and there s not too much good I can say about that  First  the car is very underpowered  It doens t even come close to matching the other competitors acceleration figures  Also  under hard acceleration  the engine has noticeable vibration and is quite loud for a supposedly  quot refined quot  V 6  Also  the axle ratio on this car is extremely low  at around 3 90 1  This means it revs really high and not that high of a speed  Also  in overdrive  it hits about 2300 2400 rpm while cruising at 65mph  Our van only does about 1900 2000 at this speed  Also mechanically  I m not to impressed with the transmission on this car  When you accelerate real lazy  it shifts smooth out of first  When you give it about half throttle  it shifts pretty rough  But then  when you floor it  it shifts smooth again  Figure that one out  Also  when it shifts from second to third at no matter what speed  it almost sounds like the engine hesitates before continuting on  Lastly  the design of this model year Taurus is pretty bad  It s way too  quot bubble shaped quot  as my girlfriend says  The circular rear window somewhat hinders rear vision  and the bulge at the top of the doors make it kind of hard to use the side mirrors  Admittedly  the Taurus has an excellent ride quality  With the upgraded suspension  it takes in bumps smoothly and even corners quite well for a midsized car  The seats are comfortable and well supportive  and the controls  though some looking quite tacky  are in easy reach and easy to use  The gauges are goodsized and understandable  and the overall roominess is great  Previous to this car  my dad had a 1994 Taurus  Compared to that  this new Taurus is much above  However  a guy I know owns a 1997 Pontiac Bonneville  and I would take that 10 to 1 over this car  That is one slick car  Not only is it extremely quick  it is quite  and incredibly smooth  I personally wouldn t really recommend this car to anyone except older folks who don t drive too much  This definately isn t the greatest car Ford has ever built  It somewhat lacks in the quality department  Kind of ironic considering their slogan  quot Quality is Job 1 quot  It s an okay car  but it s not on the top of my list     
Neg, I bought this car in the summer of 2001  At that point the car was just over 3 years old and had 23 000 miles on it  It was a one owner local trade in  and an internet title search revealed no major accidents  floods  or other problems  I paid US  10 500 As of this writing  2 years later  the car has 60 000 miles on it  I am religious about scheduled maintenance  so the car has been well taken care of  I put a lot of miles on it in the first 15 months I had it  but have since relocated and now only drive it about 10k a year So far I have not had to fix anything really major  but I have been perturbed by a number of small annoyances  First  days after I purchased the car  there was a problem with a sensor governing the cooling system  it made the cooling fan run all the time  so that the car ran too cold on the highway  The dealer fixed this for free under the terms of a 3 month  3000 mile warrantee that came with the car Second  the 6 CD changer never worked right  It won t play a CD in the  1 slot  I complained about this to the dealer when I brought the car back for the problem mentioned above  and he replaced the CD changer unit  But it didn t fix the problem  Either I got two bad units with the same problem  or the problem lay somewhere else  Since I sometimes have more pressing matters than dealing with this stuff  I never went back to the dealer again about the CD unit and live with a 5 CD changer instead Third  like several others in this forum  my Taurus has problems with the door is ajar sensor  It s completely unpredictable  Sometimes it thinks for days that a door is ajar  then suddenly the light goes off and all is well again for a while  I haven t had time to get this fixed yet  so in the meantime I yanked the circuit breaker for the interior lights   Check your owner s manual  it s clearly marked and easy to do Fourth  another strange electrical problem has seemed to go away  inexplicably  on its own  for a while  all of the lighted information on the center console  radio  clock  A C info  etc  would disappear at random intervals  When this happened  I had to turn on the headlights  which turned on the dashboard lights  to work the radio or A C  Very annoying  Even weirder  the problem hasn t recurred in nearly a year The fifth annoyance is that the entire center console between the two front seats seems to have one main function  creaking and squeaking  It drives me nuts  It squeaks and creaks constantly  I ll mention this to the dealer when I take it in for the door ajar problem  but I m not optimistic about them fixing it so it doesn t creak and squeak Sixth  with 60k on the car I m noticing the beginnings of a leaky valve cover gasket  which will need to be replaced  This used to be a job for the do it yourselfer  I did one once on an old Mercury Comet V 8  and I m not all that handy really  but these days the way engines are crammed into tiny engine compartments I woudn t want to try it myself on the Taurus  A leaky valve cover gasket can happen eventually to any car but shouldn t happen at 60k in my opinion And seventh  at 50k miles I had to replace both front brake rotors and both rear brake drums because they were all warped  There was subtle brake pedal vibration at 30k miles and by 50k it wasn t subtle any more  That shouldn t happen  Even before I bought the car  I d heard that the rotors warp easily on these cars  and that has certainly been my experience So  to sum up  I haven t exactly been thrilled with the Taurus  If I m experiencing these problems in the first 60k  what is it going to be like at 120k True  I can afford a lot of small repairs with the  8000 or so I saved by not buying a new Camry or Accord  Thus  for me  the big question is whether the powertrain will hold up over the long haul  If so  the car will still have been a bargain despite its annoyances  If not  I would have been better off buying a new Camry or Accord  
Neg, Back in December 1995  I purchased a 1995 Ford Thunderbird LX V8 with 15 000 miles on it  When I was handed the keys after signing all the paperwork and had put a deposit on 4 days prior when I first test drovie it  the car now had 16 000 miles on it  One of the salesman decided he was going to use this car to commute back and forth to work  this was the start of my problems I specifically had a car alarm installed by the dealer as my prior vehicle  a convertible Suzuki Sidekick  which was an absolutely wonderful vehicle  was a target for theives  Well  they didn t install a second switch to cut off the alarm should the remotes die or the alarm short circuits  I discovered this 6 months later and they said there was nothing they could do about it unless I paid  Oh well  I just hoped nothing would happen  First thing I did when driving out of the dealership was get new snow tires   it snowed that night Well  during the course of owning this vehicle  for 4 and half years  I put about 50 000 miles on it  Not too bad  I went through 5 sets of complete breaks  All the U Joints and CV Joints were replaced twice  The radiator and fan  not the fan belt but the fan  was replaced three times  When I got the car  I noticed the antenna was bent and the windshield wiper motor was shot  Brought it to a closer Lincoln Dealer to have these items fixed under warranty to discover the dealership I purchased it from signed me up under their own extended warranty   not the Ford warranty which I specified 10 different times  We had to go back over there and pay 800 dollars more  Then they fixed the two problems Lets see  the transmission was rebuilt twice  the driver side window would stick on occasion and not shut completely  the radio was awful  and the kicker   the Ford service people don t know what the problem is  Ooooohhhh I get so steamed when I think of this   I find out toward the end of my warranty after dealing with countless service people being rude to me  telling me it was a figment of my imagination that the car is stalling and three dealerships to figure out that there was no oil in the engine even though the dipstick said there was oil  They told me that happens when an engine gets old   and refused to fix it under warranty During the time I owned this vehicle   I contacted Ford corporate repeatedly and they never responded  Finally 2 months before the warranty ended   someone called me back   all sarcasm aside  they finally tell me there is a dispute settlement board   oh  I was supposed to get a free loaner anytime my car was in the shop for warranty repairs  Never got it   now I wanted my money back  The Dispute Settlement board refused and conveniently stated this is between me and the individual dealerships  They also said it was past my warranty   I sent it in two weeks before it expired  you get the idea I will never buy or claim ownership another Ford product again  They left such a taste of vile in my mouth  I have a Jeep now and its wonderful  Ford  may you rot in a garbage can   your service and vehicles are way below acceptable standards  
Neg, My husband fell in love with this car when he saw it on the Ford dealership s lot  We needed another vehicle  as I had totaled our Ford Taurus the previous month  This vehicle has a V 8  which both my husband and I enjoy  It also has all the little luxuries  the premium sound system  CD player  sun roof  keyless entry  leather seats  power seats  windows and locks  and automatic climate control  These little luxuries really make for a nicer driving experience  It truly was great until we had our daughter This car only has two doors  and putting her in and taking her out of the carseat can be difficult at times  If you re riding in the back seat behind someone who needs more leg room in the front you can get cramped if you re tall as well  It might be ok for short rides  but for longer trips it would be uncomfortable  The trunk space is also limited  This is fine if there s just one or two of you on a short road trip  If you re trying to go for longer distances with more luggage  forget it  I went to the airport one time to pick up my sister in law  and she brought two large suitcases  One would fit in the trunk  the other had to go in the back seat  Thankfully  at that point  we didn t have our daughter  and we could put the suitcase there  This was a great car for us before we had children  and will make a great car for my husband when we buy a more family friendly vehicle If you re single or a young couple without children  this would be great for you  If not  spend your money on a four door sedan or a mini van br br  
Neg, I have leased a 97 Thunderbird now for almost 3 years  I have had it since it was new  I leased the car based on it s nameplate and v 8 power  The car has good styling and roominess  The power from the 4 6L engine is impressive and a pleasure when on the highway  I wouldn t opt for the 3 8L v 6 for a car this size  All the controls are well laid out to give you a sports car feel  but not the sports car s lack of space  The seats could use more support though  Long rides might be tiresome for those that prefer stiffer seats  The six way power driver s seat is nice to get you in just the right position  and the tilt wheel will help finish getting you into that right position  The premium sound stereo is not bad for a factory unit and will make most people happy  The semi automatic climate control isn t the greatest  There aren t many positions to bring just fresh air in  Most times you are either using the heater or the air conditioning  These extremes will do the job though  I do prefer the older R 12 refrigerant though  it does a much better job at cooling the interior than the newer R 134a  The two major downfalls on this car are it s handling and brakes  The brakes are typical Ford  not enough for the vehicle  You will be able to stop but you ll wish you had more brakes than you do  The ABS works well  The electronic traction assist although doesn t  On anything less than clean  dry roads you will have to pay attention to what the car is doing  This is easy to tell though by the feel you get in the seat  Much of this might have to do with the independent rear suspension  I don t believe Ford put enough effort into putting the right springs in the rear of the car  It always sits high in the back which might be taking away from downforce on the rear for better traction  This could be fixed  if you are an avid automotive lover  by aftermarket springs  These would level the look of the car and lower it just a little  all this would enhance the independent suspension  Many finer cars from BMW  Mercedes Benz  the Corvette all use this type of suspension to give their cars a better ride  If Ford had done a little more work the Thunderbird would have been a much better car  This car is not for novice drivers or drivers who can t keep an eye on what their car is doing  For those drivers who like a challenging car or a car that would test their driving skills this is the car for you  I am still undecided on whether or not I will purchase this car at the end of it s lease  The power is comparable to a Mustang GT or Sport Package Crown Victoria  It s size is more roomier than a Mustang and with a few upgraded parts would probably run better than the Mustang  The pride in owning a Thunderbird is in it s nameplate  a nameplate with history  More history than the Camaro  Firebird Trans Am and Mustang  It originally was the leading sports car from the U S  until Chevrolet started making a more potent Corvette     
Neg,  Author s note   this is not a review of the ZX2  it s a review of the 4 door SE  for which there is no category even though there are 2 categories for the ZX2  Be forewarned There s not a single thing wrong with driving a small car   in fact  it s generally my opinion that there  is  something wrong with driving BIG cars  This is especially true for condo dwelling attorneys and accountants who insist on driving diesel powered duallys and SUVs the size of school buses  On the rare occasions that ms scmrak lets me have it  I drive a Toyota Tacoma  otherwise it s a Honda Accord  So when the rental agency couldn t give me a  standard  car for my two week rental  I went ahead and took the Ford Escort they  did  have  Reluctantly  though  and not because it s fire engine red  Reluctantly because I ve driven these things before Now at the end of my two week rental  with 1000 plus miles of driving the car  I m ready to take the little red sewing machine back to the rental people with my compliments  Why  It s not that it s small  although it  is  rather cozy if there s anyone else in the car  it s that nobody should ever have designed a car with an engine this small married to an  automatic transmission  There s nothing particularly  wrong  with that little four banger  it gets around 27 MPG on the highway  come to think of it though  I ve driven 8 cylinder cars that get upwards of 24  Likewise  there s nothing particularly wrong with the Escort design   it s neither attractive nor unattractive  just sort of a blah little car  In fact it makes a pretty good car for running errands around town  it scoots into parking places neatly  turns on a dime  and has a fairly roomy trunk for your purchases As a highway car  though  it s a dog  even worse than its grandparent  the Pinto  The marriage of a low torque  underpowered four cylinder engine to an automatic transmission geared for economy has created a puppy that can t outrun its own shadow  Sure  it s got lots of low end power for pickup away from a stop light  but try to accelerate from 65 to 70 on a highway  and you ll have plenty of time to pick out a new china pattern and get your teeth cleaned while you wait  I could only hope that a five speed manual transmission would be an improvement over the three speed automatic b The accelerator pedal  For better or for worse  the Escort s built on Ford s oval concept  like the redesigned Taurus and the Contour  That oval motif abounds  including dashboard  instrument panel  mirrors  and trim elements  The design makes for a clean shape and clear sight lines from the cockpit  The cabin is relatively comfortable  although cramped  and the trunk affords plenty of storage room  The engine runs smoothly and efficiently  with good mileage  in the 27 30 range for my two weeks and 1087 miles of mixed highway and city driving  The vehicle handles nimbly at low speeds  the steering is responsive  Overall  the construction is on par with or exceeds similar American made cars  and approaches the quality of Japanese economy imports  In point of fact  the Escort is an excellent example of the timeworn maxim   you get what you pay for  Ford doesn t squander much of its budget on amenities  which is a good idea for an economy car  Unfortunately  they don t squander much on engine power  either b The brake pedal  Ford s fascination with that oval design motif extends too far in at least one case  the side view mirrors afford a dangerously small field of vision  particularly at the outer edges  The interior has plenty of headroom  but the door openings are short   sometimes painfully so  as passengers are prone to bumping heads while entering and exiting  The standard four cylinder engine is underpowered at high speeds  and noisy at any speed  At idle  it sounds suspiciously like a sewing machine  at full throttle  the noise can drown out the radio  My sample  which now has slightly below 11 000 miles under its fanbelt  has developed a few rattles and squeaks plus a tendency to buzz at certain engine speeds  The air conditioning unit struggled to cool the car in direct sunlight  even though Houston topped out at 75 degrees F while I was driving the Escort   Where the rubber meets the road  Overall the car is   as mentioned above   a good example of getting what you pay for  If you have enough cash for a tricked out Escort  though  I d strongly suggest getting yourself a similarly priced version of an import   it will hold its value longer and very likely be less prone to problems involving design and workmanship  If you can drive a manual transmission  it would be a better option for this vehicle  the combination of a puny power plant with an automatic transmission is unsettling at highway speeds  
Neg, I bought a 1990 White Ford Probe in 1994  It had 60 000 miles on it  and according to my mechanic  was in good shape  It had a manual transmission  a sunroof  power windows  power door locks  and tinted windows  It drove very well  and it was my favorite car  but that did not last very long I had to take it to the shop to get a new transmission after having it only four months  I also had several other problems which I will not go into at this time  The culmination of the problems was when the engine BURNED up in 1996  I was driving down the highway when all of the sudden  smoke starts coming out of the hood  I pull over  look at the hood  and almost open it  before I noticed flames shooting out from under the hood  Luckily  I had a cellular phone with me and called 911 to get them to extinguish my car  The engine was totally melted which basically the car was totaled  I did not take any action against Ford  but if I knew what I know now  I would have  I have heard from at least two other people who had owned ford probes that the same thing happened to them The bottom line is steer clear of this car if you can     
Neg, I bought a 1990 ford probe gl in 1998  i payed 2500 00 for it used  the car was a very good deal at the time  I am a certified mechanic so i check out the car throughly  Finding nothing really wrong with the car i purchased it About 6 months after i bought it the rack and pinion went out  1 week after that the radiator went out with the lower control arm  the headlight motors the exhaust system the automatic seatbelts  the passenger side mirror  the power steering pump  the rocker arms and oh yeah finally the fuel pump wires arched against the gas tank when i ws driving and the back of the car went up in flames  I got out in time before it was too late  So my opion is do not buy a old probe it is nothing but headache br br  
Neg, I haven t driven an Escort since my 1993 model and now I know why  Our Ford Ranger XLT was involved in an auto accident a few weeks ago so our rental car is this 1999 Ford Escort  Now I ve owned a Ford Escort before  it was a 1993 model and after two blown headgaskets  a new radiator  major engine work and  1500 later  I traded it in for my first truck which was a Toyota 4X2 until I traded that in for the Ford Ranger  Now that you know why I am driving this Ford Escort  let me tell you about it b Dwarf Ponies or maybe mice b This little car may be economical  but it certainly is comical when it comes to the  horsepower  this thing has  To put it bluntly  it sucks on hills  You need to start hitting the gas pedal hard about 500 feet before you climb a hill or else it simply will max out and everyone is passing you b Park Place  We ve been driving this car now for two weeks  We have had to leave at least 5 to 10 minutes early so we can get this car out of PARK  The button that releases the stick is a crap shoot if you get it to push in so it will release the shift  I spent 10 minutes of my lunch hour yesterday trying to get it out of park  I swore that when I did I was going right to the rental place to exchange cars  They did not have any available  but the guy told me that if the shift would not move out of PARK to push this little flat black button next to the stick and it would release the shift and allow me to push the shift s button all the way in so I can move out of PARK  NOW HE TELLS ME b But there is a bright side  The car gets excellent gas mileage  In these days of high gas prices  it cost us  15 00 to fill the tank up and it lasted for a good 200 miles of mostly highway driving  Our Ford Ranger guzzles about double that  but it is a 20 gallon tank  but gets only about 100 miles more than the Escort b Price  As a rental  you can t beat the price  19 99 a day  As a first family car  I would also recommend it  In fact I recommend everyone should rent the vehicle they intend on buying for a week to see if it will meet all of their expectations  A simple test drive won t tell you how it performs in your daily lives and it is far better to spend that extra  50 to make sure it will  
Neg, Ok  we aren t rich  and can t afford a new car  but  I have had the experience of this thing  If I did have the money for a new car this would be one of the LAST cars I would pick  If I won a free one in a contest  I would sale it  Ok  We had a 1989 Ford Escort  2 door  This is a 99  4 door  RA was rear ended  This is the rental car they gave us to use  Ok  What I really don t like is the electronic windows  Which is a danger to me in a vehicle accident  being in the Ambulance for 12 plus years  electric windows and things of that make it a lot harder to access a vehicle once a battery is cut   have to take out a window if the doors are locked  The only thing that is not is the seat belts  Go figure  Our older Escort  had automatic seat belts and that s the only thing  I just find that funny Ok  the dash  center consul the radio controls and heat controls  all sort of blend in together  The dash lights come on automatically when the car is running  When night time comes and you turn on the head lights  the stupid dash lights dim  yeah there is a knob to brighten them  but not as much as we would like  It s not exactly easy on gas  as I was figured it would be  It uses more than our 10 year older car  Pretty much the same motor  We travel a lot  it s a hour to RA s family  So at least once a week we travel there  I didn t like the way this car rides  After half the trip toward his family  I decided I hate the way it rides  Never before   aside from when I was pregnant  have I gotten car sick on this trip  nor did my kids  We all ended up car sick half way there  and had to make a emergency stop  Something else  the baby would sleep most of the trip in our car  He carry s on at least half the trip in the 99  and I think its the way he rides in this thing too   Or maybe he can sense how uncomfortable we all are  I like driving the car  but RA doesn t  The sun visors are too small  The headlights  which can be moved a bit  are two low and outward  The worst thing so far  we were heading home  first really warm day  and we had the windows down  it started to rain  We smoke  I know shame shame  So up went the windows  Well when we cracked the widows to smoke  the design of this car  the water poured in the windows  They weren t even open a half of a inch  I have rode in MANY cars and had windows cracked open over the years  At least 8 off of the top of my head  and this is the only time that s happened Granted I will give you the safety features  have to have break depressed to put in or out of gear  Locks on master window controls so that only the driver can control all the windows  BUT that stinks because when it s on  I can t open and close my window The dome light stays on till you start the car or for a time after you get out   Talk about frustration  till we learned all these things out Also maybe you will find this funny as I didn t  and do now  The first time I drove this car after dark  after unloading kids  handing them bags sending them toward the house  I loaded up the last of everything into my arms and kicked the door shut almost losing half my load  The dome light didn t go out  So I butt bumped all the doors to make sure they were closed  swearing at the light still being on  I despirately with much difficaulty sat the soda s from Mc D s on the hood  put the bags from my hand on the hood  slide the bag from my wrist down on my hand and sat it up on the hood dug the keys out of my pocket and got six inches from the lock and the light went off  again swearing and kicked the car  got the stuff loaded back up and headed toward the house as RA came looking for me  Then laughed hysterically at me  only because he had done the same thing  making it back to the house and noticeing the light on till he got his boots on and back out side it was off  Ok  there is a button for trunk in the glove box  even if car is shut off   I don t like that part  but do in a way  like the child that died from locking himself in and with the keys  till they found him  they couldn t get him help  worth breaking a window to me that way to pop the truck with no keys but it makes it easier to get into for would be thiefs  Electronic door locks  with the extra by window button locks too   I like that a lot  Lots of trunk space  The only advantage this has over our older model  is three seat belts instead of two and four doors instead of two I just feel  I found more cons  with having this thing here for two weeks  With the many MANY other brands and types of cars out there  There is a lot of better choices to pick  Sure I gave you  a lot of things I don t like about this car  But I feel the pros are few  and this car would make a poor choice for anyone  Maybe that s because I don t have the money for a new car  Looking at spending that much on a car  I would expect it to be lacking any poor quality in ANY way it s made   I hope you understand what I mean br br  
Neg, My first new car purchase was a ZX2  I wanted a car that was economical on gas  I really liked the way it looked too  But sometimes looks can be deceiving  It s a snappy little car and it does get good gas mileage  But don t try to smoke a cigarette when it s raining out  The water drips right into the window  It s really a hassle  It s not from the rain coming from the sky either  it s the rain wiped from the windshield that gets you  Mostly it drips right onto the controls for the locks and windows  The tires on this car are 15 quot  This would not be a problem if you were not worried about the cost to replace them  They only last for about 20 000 to 30 000 miles  The cheapest tires I found were  91 00 and  supposedly  only Goodyear makes them  That is not very economical in my book  The cassette player died after 1 year  The passenger side window failed to close after 3 months  The ride is OK  The struts seem a little stiff even after a year of driving it  I think Ford could have done a much better job of creating this vehicle  Do your homework when buying any vehicle  Don t get stuck with an economical vehicle that costs too much to maintain br br  
Neg, I recently rented a late model Escort for a month  I m not one of those people whose identities are shaped and or expressed by a cool car    the more anonymous  the better  is my motto  Few cars are more generic than a beige Escort  I kept mistaking other cars for my rental  once even accidentally setting off the alarm on a similar looking sedan  I cravenly ran away before the owner could show up Under 45 miles per hour and 6 feet of driver height  this is generally a decent utilitarian car  It handles decently  especially in confined spaces like parking lots  is extremely easy to park  and goes in and out of first gear fairly snappily if somewhat twitchily  There s a surprising amount of interior space for such a small car  plenty for me   although I never use the back seats  so I can only speak for the front seats  The trunk is also quite roomy for a subcompact   I managed to shove a huge computer box in there  which wouldn t fit into the trunk of a midsize sedan  This would be a very nice car for running around town  especially if you re a woman However  most of my driving is done on Highway 101 in California  This is where the two biggest weaknesses of the Escort are revealed  it sucks on the freeway  and the gas tank is really really small  This car has no pickup at highway speeds   now that the speed limit in many states has been increased  this is a bigger concern than it might have been a couple years ago  The brakes are also correspondingly weak and squeaky  and cornering at highway speeds is not very secure feeling  The ride is also extremely rattle y  like small parts might be about to break off at any moment  Finally  with my 50 mile daily commute it seems like I rattle my way from one gas station to the next  I haven t been blown away by the mileage I m achieving either  which seems to be less than 20 miles per gallon Finally  this car is clearly designed for shorter drivers  I m 5 4 quot  The steering wheel is small  the car rides low  the dash is low  the ignition key is set super low  and the seat can be pushed forward so far your thighs can be trapped under the console  If you re a larger human being  you won t appreciate any of this br br  
Neg, As a Social Worker I find myself on the Georgia highways and byways usually doing a lot of commuting especially when it comes to traveling with a group of children  If you ve ever taken a trip with a bunch of teenagers then you know the importance of traveling in the right vehicle  Which brings me to my most recent outing to the movies with my group of weekend pre teens in the 2001 Ford Windstar LX  Frankly  as a bachelor the minivan would not be my first choice as a slime and trim sporty auto  Primarily due to its style since minivans usually have  family  written all over them  However for those looking for a family van you may find one of the six models of the 2001 Ford Windstar to your liking  The models or trims which is a term used in the automotive world to describe the different styles available which includes your base model  the LX  SE  SEL  the limited or the SE Sport  The vehicle we used was the Windstar 2001 LX passenger van  The Windstar van made me feel like I was turning into my father  I immediately began having flashbacks of our station wagon and all the family discussion regarding that vehicle  The other families in our neighborhood referred to us as the  Brady Bunch   The Brady Bunch was 1969 ABC TV series in which the Brady family used a 1958 Plymouth Station Wagon The Windstar is synonymous with practical family transportation and although I don t consider it stylish  and find it to plain for my taste  for some this versatile vehicle is becoming as popular as the 1968 Plymouth Station Wagon  This passenger van has a savage V 6 12 valve 4 speed electronic automatic transmission engine with an electronic ignition  It s almost identical to its 2000 Windstar predecessor with its 3 0 liter 6 cylinder engine  When driving this vehicle you can really feel front wheel drive the pulling to the front wheels  On the highway this machine floats like a 1970 Cadillac  If you ve ever road in a 1970 Cadillac you will remember how it almost floats like a boat on the highway  The van is a little bouncy on the road probably due to the soft suspension that seems to sway when driving  The front suspension uses the highly recommended MacPherson struts  while at the rear a twist beam axle acts as its own stabilizer bar with its suspension coil springs  The Windstar s steel body is very rigid  despite it s rack and pinion steering system it s considered a heavyweight in the minivan world  There is nothing fancy about the outside since exterior features are fairly rudimentary red color  Its red from the front and rear colored bumpers to the red colored grille  The Windstar s seven passenger seating offers lots of room and comfortable seating for smaller framed people however if you are traveling with a teenagers wearing baggy clothes it seats five comfortably  There are three rows of seats  the front bucket seats with the fixed headrest and armrest remind are fairly comfortable for the driver  however you can only adjust these two seats so far  Perhaps in a 2001 I was expecting a softer seat  or perhaps captain chairs like the seat on the Star Trek Enterprise  The seats were fairly comfortable during our trip to the movies however I would suspect that they would not be as equally comfortable on long distance trip  It s nice that the passenger seat is adjustable and removable with full folding 3 person bench second row seating  Legroom is plentiful if you are 5 9  any taller and you may feel a bit cramped  The Windstar LX features the much talked about 4 wheel anti locking braking system and dual airbags  with adjustable seatbelts plus daytime running halogen headlamp lights  Although the daytime running lights are popular  I personally don t like them  Perhaps its related to my childhood memories of attending funerals with my Dad driving  following a processional of cars streaming their lights during the day  Standard equipment on all of the 2001 Windstar LX include tinted glass  an AM FM stereo system with four speakers two in the front and two in the rear  It also features a passive anti theft system  cupholders and a locking glove box with a light installed  The Windstar is a functional piece of machinery  In a 2001 vehicle I was looking for more up to date features and gadgets  The simple dashboard with the typical Ford layout is boring  Ford is notorious for its poor ergonomics and dashboard layout  On the dashboard you will find the typical analog instrumentation with a tachometer  trip odometer  water temp gauge  and the usual warning indicators including the oil pressure  battery  lights on  key in ignition  low fuel  low washer fluid  door ajar  brake fluid  the only that s new to me is the bulb failure light In all fairness the LX does have a sliding door on the driver s side which seemed unusual at first and took a little getting use to  This van is ideal for people that want to use their minivan for a small business because it allows you the ability to toss out the rear bench seat  The Ford Windstar is an affordable minivan ranging between  20 000 to 35 000 depending upon the model you choose  Although there are no recalls on the Windstar 2001 LX  this particular Ford has a history of recalls and mechanical problems  In 1996 there was a recall on the rear power windows because the connections failed and the wiper switch needed to be replaced  So far it has not been reported that the Windstar 2001 faces the challenges of its predecessor s  It s been noted by Ford that the Windstar is the first minivan to earn the U  S  government s five star front crash test rating  The safety system  includes dual stage front air bags  crash severity sensors  safety belt usage sensor  driver seat position sensor  and safety belt pretensions plus the lift gate comes with a high mounted lamp which provides excellent light at night  We road on 4 good P215 70R15 BSW tires w  15 inch 5 spoke wheel coverings  However if you get a flat you ll be riding around on a donut since this vehicle comes with a mini spare tire  The Windstar 2001 LX uses unleaded gas  yet guzzles it like a 1970 Cadillac  In a time when gas prices are sky rocketing this 3 8 liter engine is not the most economical  Albeit my experience with the Windstar LX was limited  and in spite of this vans impressive safety rating  this vehicle would not be my first choice for family travel  It would be ideal if Ford would match safety and customer satisfaction  I was looking for a little bit more out of a 2001  
Neg, Leased a 2001 Ford Windstar LX  maintenance package  daytime running lights  safety package  etc  We really want to like this vehicle but the number of irritations makes it impossible  Soem are the quality of the vehicle some are dealer together they generate a very bad ownership experience First it is a Gas Guzzler  13 MPG dealer  Ford of Upland  CA  says so what  The electronics are sloppy  the Auto Mirrors  Seats  and Day Running Lights Don t Work  The Memory adjustments for the seats and mirrors reset to neutral every time you hit the unlock button  Dealer says   Just reprogram  why have memory if you have to adjust them each time you get in  The day running lights generate an error on the dash that must be canceled to view mileage etc  every time you start the van  Air conditioner makes a loud clunk when you first turn it on  Poor controls on the onboard video system  Seats are very heavy and hard to get in and out  Purchased the regular maintenance package on the basis of Oil Change is same as Quick Lube Service Our first oil change we had to leave the van for 5 hours  FORD has very poor quality control over dealers Our 4th FORD Van with each FORD has gotten worse   our last  
Neg, I admit that I m not much of a mechanic so this will not be detailed or technical  I ll just get to the basics  Six years ago  my parents bought a 1996 Ford Windstar  and today  it s a constant pain  We ve had problems with all sorts of noises  there have been times when we had noises whenever the car turned and noises when you apply the brakes  Also  the brake warning light is constantly coming on leading to road trips in which we worry if we ll make it home safely  We usually don t use it for long trips unless we have a lot of stuff to carry  We ve also had transmission problems  The brakes have even stopped working once  However  when we take the van to the Ford place to get it fixed  the mechanics claim that they don t hear the noises  When they do  fix  it  we end up with a different noise the next month  Once  we even had to take it back the week after taking it to the shop  Further taking the car to the shop is a day long event  or longer  and a major incovenience It turns out that the Ford Windstar was recalled because of brake problems but not the 1996 although it appears that there was reason to  Apparently we were among the truly blessed since others have had accidents caused by head gasket problems  The epinions site wouldn t let me put the link here for you  it read it as a word that was too long  but look it up at consumeraffairs com All in all it seems sorry compared to our Toyota Camry which we rarely have to take to the shop and when we do  the service is much better  Over the years we have spent thousands on fixing this car  My mom s credit card bill has risen because of repairs on this minivan  Perhaps you would be blessed to find one of the good ones but I wouldn t risk it  
Neg, After a disastrous encounter with a drunk driver in 1989  my husband bought this car  new  with the insurance money  Although we thought it was cool when we first got it  we soon outgrew it  Unfortunately  we could not afford to replace it until last year  when we got a NEW 2000 Nissan Maxima SE b First  what did I like about this car b It looked cool  with front and rear spoilers and ground effects  It had a low  throaty growl that just sounded tough  When I was 20  I thought this was   quot kewl quot i   Now that I m somewhere around 30  it s just noise pollution  This is a car that announces its presence   Guys  if you re considering buying this car and you still have a curfew  this car will make it impossible for you to sneak home after hours i I also liked the power of this car  At 225hp  the slightest touch on the gas would send the car hurtling forward  I could pretend I was on the  Batman amp Robin  ride at Six Flags  Somewhere around 1990 or 1991  I set my personal best land speed record on an unnamed interstate  at 115 mph   The car could go faster  but we were gaining too quickly on some state troopers ahead When I started dating my husband  he d just gotten this car  I did agree to marry him  so I guess you could say that girls dig this car b What DIDN T I like about this car b Where do I begin  First let me say that this car was maintained very carefully  even babied  and garaged as often as possible  Even so 1  The GT we had was an automatic transmission  which made this car a lot less fun to drive  Combined with a rear wheel drive and a lot of power  it was  almost impossible to control in bad weather   Even on plowed streets  the  Stang had trouble getting up moderate hills  Compared to my cars  89 Toyota Celica GT  90 Ford Probe GT  there was a significant decrease in the amount of control  even in the rain  I ve done donuts across 4 lane highways going 10 miles per hour in the Mustang  It s not an experience I d care to repeat 2   Overall poor design b  There are horrendous blind spots out of both side rear windows  making it difficult to pass other cars on the highway  Given that the sheer power of this car makes you want to go fast on the highway  it becomes very frustrating very quickly   Same with the hood  the slope of it makes it hard to ascertain exactly where the front end of the car is  making parallel parking difficult The car has the worst turning radius of any car I ve ever driven  There is no such thing as a 3 point turn in this car  Try 5 or 7 points to get this car turned around The horn is contained in two little buttons on the steering wheel  with the air bag taking up the center space  In an emergency situation  the last thing you want to do is to be looking frantically for the horn  Honking the horn on this car takes finger precision  you can t just slam on the steering wheel  All you ll get is a little  quot slap  slap quot  as you re looking for the horn The instrument panel and stereo are made up of lots of little buttons  impossible to use if you re wearing gloves  The only exception is the heat AC  which are dials that are easily manipulated  Same with the levers for moving the seats forward and back  small  difficult to find For a hatchback  it does not have much room in the back  The shape of the hatchback leaves the last foot of space virtually unusable  as it is only about 8 quot  high  The hatchback is also very heavy  Opening and closing it is a full upper body workout Needless to say  given that the roof of the car slopes down sharply after the front seats  the rear seats are uncomfortable for anyone over 5 2 quot  The front seats do not slide forward  and the front seat belts are attached to the rear armrests  so the front shoulder belt  quot clotheslines quot  passengers getting out of the back  Ever wonder what it feels like to be born  Trying to get out of the rear seats of this car is a pretty good approximation  Because of the attachment of the seatbelts  which seem designed for people taller than 5 7 quot  the shoulder belt is not really adjustable  If you are 5 7 quot   like me  or shorter  you ll get a red welt on the side of your neck from the rubbing shoulder belt 3   Things just break  over and over again b  This car does not have great reliability  It was fine for the first one or two years  and then it slowly began to fall apart  We noticed a constant squeaking noise within the first year  After several visits to the shop  they finally determined that it was the speedometer cable  After lubricating the cable  the squeaking stopped  For about two weeks  Eventually we just learned to live with it From the 3rd to 5th years of owning it  the fuel pump died  three times i  Each time was a  200  repair  not to mention car rental  There was never any notice that something was going wrong  it would just fail to start  Completely dead  No turnover Somewhere around this time  the A C finally died  too  I don t even remember what exactly the problem was  I think it was a freon leak somewhere in the system  Either way  it was  500 700 that we didn t have at the time The hatchback pistons stopped holding the hatchback in the  quot raised quot  position after 3 5 years  and the repair lasted another 3 years  Getting groceries out of the back  all 4 bags of them  involves lifting the hatchback in a clean and jerk motion  balancing it on your head  leaning  way  way  forward  remember the 8 quot  of unusable space at the rear of the hatchback  grabbing the groceries  and then ducking your head out fom under the hatchback  without getting clonked on the head or getting the greasy hatchback latch tangled in your hair   Now repeat  4 times After about 7 years  the power windows and locks started to go  They d only work some of the time  sometimes the window would go down crooked  and it made another loud   quot SQUEEEEEEEE quot b  noise as it was going up and down  Eventually  the entire console on the passenger side just died  I could not lock or unlock the door  or raise or lower the windows  For a while  my husband could control them from his side  Then they died altogether  and I had to climb in from the driver s side  or sit in the back  Not easy to do in formalwear The computer also did strange things from around the 5th year on  For a few months  the battery would drain overnight and we couldn t charge it up again  After we brought it into the shop and they  quot reset the computer quot  it didn t happen any more  The  quot check engine quot  light would come on occasionally  especially in cooler weather  below 40 degrees  About 50  of the time  there really was something wrong  and the other 50  of the time  there was nothing wrong  Sort of like your own version of Lotto  except each ticket costs  100 and you never win 4   It s expensive b  In addition to the aforementioned repairs  the  quot sporty quot  nature of the car means that equipment is expensive  too  The car came with Goodyear Eagle GT tires  With the original tires  on a dry road  the car was a lot of fun to drive  But the wheel size is odd  and pretty much the only tires that would fit were performance Goodyear Eagles and Yokohama tires that didn t last all that long  30 000   40 000 miles  In the ten years of owning this car  we never found tires to fit that were under  100 apiece Insurance  too  was very very expensive  Even with USAA  which is often 1 2 or 2 3 the cost of private insurance  my husband was paying around  1000 per year  with a perfect driving record and in a state with low insurance rates   To compare  I had a similar value Ford Taurus insured through State Farm and it was about  300 a year  His insurance went down a little when we got married  but not by much At best  the Mustang GT 5 0 gets around 15 mpg  Of course  it likes hi octane gas  We noticed a significant difference in the pickup and in the noise between 89 octane and 93 octane  Even before gas prices went nuts  we d pay almost  20 to fill the tank 5   Comfort  What comfort b  Thanks to the sporty suspension  the rock hard seats and the constant rumbling of the engine  you get a good feel of the road  every pebble and bump  After about 30 minutes  my butt would get numb from the vibration  I don t know if this is a good thing or not  on the one hand  you no longer feel every little crack in the road  On the other  you don t feel your own crack  either  and you climb out of the car waddling like the Brady Bunch after they took the mule ride into the Grand Canyon  In true muscle car tradition  there is also no insulation from the road noise and the engine noise  This was a typical conversation while driving in the Mustang i Dr  kboo   How do I get to  RRRRRRR  by the  RRRRRRR  i kboo   Turn right at  RRRRRRR  and then  RRRRRRR  i Dr  kboo   WHAT i kboo   Turn  right  at  RRRRRRR  and then  RRRRRRR  at  RRRRRRR  gesturing frantically  HERE  HERE  NOW SUMMARY If you live in a warm  sunny climate and you don t need dependable transportation  the Mustang GT 5 0 is fun to drive  when it s working  It s barely comfortable for two people  and can t carry much stuff  Whatever money you have left after filling it with gas will go to repairs  It is terrible for long road trips  as the seats are only comfortable for about 20 30 minutes On the other hand  even when we sold it last year  3500  at 10 years old and around 120 000 miles  it still turned heads  There will always be a market for this car because of how it looks and sounds  and because of the Mustang name and tradition I would NOT recommend this car as a teen s first car  it is difficult to handle even for experienced drivers  and expensive to insure and maintain     
Neg, Through a bizarre series of family events  I attained my 1990 Ford Mustang 5 0 LX hatchback for free  I had just got my license a week ago  so I was thrilled to receive such a legendary car as my first car  and completely for free  I mean  you re a 17 year old male  how could you say no to 225 horsepower  300 ft lbs of torque  a V8 engine with a few modifications here and there  The owner before me was quite the drag racing enthusiast  so the mods included  stabilizer bars  dual Flowmaster exhaust  and ram air intake  The only thing I didn t like at the time was that it was automatic transmission  But no worries  it was free  and I saved my mother at least  4 000 Ya know  maybe I had a lemon  I know how to take care of cars  I never raced it  and I treat my property with the utmost respect  But within the second week  there was a major transmission problem  it wouldn t go over 45 mph  I guess it wouldn t change into the next gear  all it did was rev high  My entire transmission had to be rebuilt  totaling about  1 750  My mother and I said to ourselves   Okay  this is just one problem  We ll get it fixed  then that ll be it Next thing I know  I m stuck in traffic on Highway 4 and smoke is coming out from under my hood  I call up a friend who knows more about cars than I  and he suggests it s an old thermostat that should be replaced  So over a weekend  he and I replace the thermostat with relatively no trouble  besides a few bruised and cut fingers  After that  the car ran like a chime  For about a week  Just today  in fact  I was stuck in traffic  My temperature gauge read normal  but there was smoke coming from underneath the car this time  It seems that there are too many problems for me to justify keeping the car  oil leak  improper alignment  squeaky brakes  wobbly power windows  the overheating  insurance  attention from cops  etc  Most of the things I ve mentioned can be fixed  but the thing is that after I fix it  I know something else will turn up  I guess it just comes with the territory of a muscle car There are things I like about the car  Its loud and growly exhaust never gets tiring  It s fast and powerful  With 300 ft lbs of torque  you can dust your everyday ricer and make them feel stupid for putting on those pointless decals  You get plenty of attention when cruising past the theater on a Friday night  With ritualistic washing and detailing  the car looks beautiful  even if it has its share of dings and dents  But I m afraid that the problems I ve had outweigh the things I like about the car If you re into fun driving  I don t suggest this car  It ll give you good quarter mile times  but don t expect to do any canyon carving with this car  I mean  you could  but I know that I m too scared of going into uncontrollable oversteer and driving off of a cliff  Heck  my airbag isn t even functional right now So I m looking into selling the  Stang  It was a decent car while its problems remained hidden  Besides  I m into  fun  driving  Can you say Mazda Miata  Toyota MR2 Turbo  They may not beat a  Stang or Camaro on the strip  but personally  I see the bends more often than a quarter mile strip  And the thrill I get of downshifting and upshifting around a series of corners is much more exciting than getting low 9s at the strip  
Neg, The Ford Mustang may have lots of beef  but the one in my household just can t handle the power  My mother let me drive it to my prom last year and I was going to a party in which I had to travel about 4 exits on the interstate  When I arrived at my destination  there was enough smoke coming out from under the hood to attract the local fire department  When I came home  my mom thought that I broke it  She took it to the local Ford garage  and they said that a piece of plastic had blown up in front of the radiator and blocked to air flow through it  This is a sign of poor engineering and I hope that since the 1997 model  Ford has fixed this flaw  It costed my mom over  1 000 to fix  Then after a couple months  when my mom took the stang in for a rough shifting problem  they told her that a part had been recalled for her model of Mustang  This part happened to be the exact plastic piece that heated up and cracked when I drove it  Another incident is just to note the quality of our local Ford garage  My mom took her Stang in to get a new battery and cables  A week later  her battery died again and she popped the hood  There was tons of corrosion caked al over the battery terminals  When she took it back to the Ford garage  they admitted that a new battery had never been put in  Then they tried to tell her that they would put a new battery in  but she would still have to pay for it  She told them to put in the battery and that she would expect not to pay for it  When she came to pick up the Stang  Her bill said   quot no charge quot  After this attempt to cheat my mom out of her hard earned cash  we have decided that the Stang is the last Ford we will own br br  
Neg, Do you know those days that seem perfect  just because of a little pleasant surprise   Something like that happened to me in the early spring of  98  I was traveling to King of Prussia  PA  and was just picking up my rental at the Philly Airport Hertz  I was expecting the usual Ford Contour  but I got a Ford Mustang instead  I felt like I was actually able to enjoy the ride this time Let me tell you that the Mustang is normally not my kind of vehicle  I think I m a little too old  early thirties  for its target group  and I normally prefer Japanese or German convertibles for my sport cars  But hey  what did I have to loose  The first thing I noticed when I got into the car was a strange smell  It smelled like a mixture of cleaner and bananas  I could explain the cleaner and then I found a ton of banana peels stuffed under the driver s seat  Who had been driving this thing before   Okay  but back to the vehicle itself  I liked the way it looked  It was a glossy black  and I like the older body style quite a bit I was surprised by its low rpm pickup  realizing that it was only the six cylinder model Highway driving was great and very comfortable  with enough of reserves to pass when needed I had a ball pulling it out of the parking lot and getting it onto the freeway  The only thing that irked me was the somewhat jerky automatic transmission  yet it shifted predictably and at what seemed the right time for me The interior was typical for Ford  Cloth seats with lots of plastic around  but rather practical  I don t mind that kind of styling in my truck  but in a sporty vehicle   But I had to remind myself that this car is actually rather inexpensive So  rather pleased with the vehicle I arrived at my hotel  planning to take it out again for a spin the next day  To those who don t know the area  This part of Pennsilvania is very hilly  with plenty of nice low traffic sideroads  Taking the car through the hills and turns was something I had looked forward to Boy  was I in for a surprise  I was owning a Mazda Miata at that time  and I approached the corners the same way I would have in the Miata  The Mustang started to fishtail  and I had to put quite some effort into preventing the excessive oversteer from turning into a spin I thought it was a fluke  so I tried the next turn and the result was the same  I slowed down quite a bit after that  Returning to the hotel I checked the car  Tire inflation seemed to be fine and I couldn t detect any damage to the rims   At least as far as my visible inspection went  I didn t have a tire gauge with me I didn t take to cars  to the hills  after that and drove it around town It pains me to give a  do not recommend  to this vehicle  because I liked it quite a bit  It looks great and is very affordable  I m sure that one can have plenty of fun with it  But I would recommend it too a friend  because it is just too easy to be overconfident and use the power beyond what the car or the suspension can handle  
Neg, A Mustang is a wonderful all around sports car  It has been around since 1964  The early years i thin are still the best cars but some of the things on this new 2000 were on the early models  Such as the ring around the symbol of the Mustang  My friend has a 1997 Mustang Cobra with a mystic paint job  Can you say wow  Can this car win some awards  This car goes to almost 11 shows a year and has not gotten below 2nd place  This paint job is pretty smooth When the sun shines on the car it turns different colors such as green  blac  purple  blue it is relly neat looking br br  
Neg, This car looks good   REAL good I had a handsome  red model on a long term hire from a dealership in San Jose  when I was working there  and it certainly turned heads when I cruised down Stevens Creek Boulevard on the way home from work   especially on the occasions when I was giving a lift home to Lucy  a rather gorgeous blonde co worker of mine However  appearances aren t quite everything  and the 1997 Mustang isn t quite as good as it looks  in performance terms at least Put it this way you don t want to take it drag racing The acceleration is really quite poor  It is unresponsive to the throttle  and was embarrassingly beaten to the punch at the lights by several vehicles which could hardly be described as  sporty Having said that  the mid range power is much more pleasing   there seems to be plenty of  oomph  under the bonnet when you put your foot down at 40 50mph  However  another gripe I had was the sluggish handling  Again a fairly minor consideration  but it did lack the  nippiness  that I have always associated with a good sports car However  these are only minor irritations  In conclusion  this is still one cool car  The performance isn t great  but when it looks this good  it s pretty easy to forgive Still  I feel that if you are looking to buy a convertible  then better performance may be found elsewhere Still fun to drive  though br br  
Neg, While I was determining the fate of my  1989 Toyota Camry  a couple of weeks ago  I had the experience of driving a  2000 Ford Focus Sedan  for a week as a rental car from  Accent Rental  The  Ford Focus  which I rented was advertised as a mid sized vehicle  Believe me when I tell you  this vehicle is not mid sized in my personal opinion  The vehicle is small in size on the outside as well as the inside  As many of you may know from reading previous epinions  my oldest son is a big defensive lineman  Somehow  I managed to get him inside this vehicle without him being overly uncomfortable  but overall the entire vehicle was way too small for my tastes  After we put the seat all the way back  there was no way that anyone could sit behind him  even a small child The interior of the  Focus  which I drove was rather cheaply made  Even though the vehicle only had about 19 000 miles on it the seats were showing signs of extreme wear both on the front and back  Being that my own  quot new quot  car has about 1000 more miles than the  Focus  did  the quality of my  Chevrolet Impala s  interior is far superior than the  Focus  While the overall exterior of the  Focus  was very attractive and the trunk space was rather roomy for a car this size  there were two things which I experienced with the performance of this vehicle which gave me a total negative impression of the  Focus b The first thing that I really did not like about the  Ford Focus  is that the air conditioning needed to be a bit cooler in the car  I realize that the week that I had driven this vehicle was one of the hottest in Atlanta s history  and the air quality was horrendous  but I felt that any vehicle that is  quot new quot  on the market should be able to completely fill the vehicle with cool air on demand  I found that I had to continuously run the air conditioning all of the time full blast to get this result Because I had to run the air conditioning in that manner  I encountered the second problem which was more serious  With the air conditioning going full blast  the car had no get up and go  This presented problems when I was going up hills here in our area which are very steep to say the least  The  Focus  had a hard time going up the hills and I had to give the vehicle so much gas that I thought I was going to flood the car  Consequently when the week was up and I had purchased my new  Impala   I was very happy to turn this vehicle in  I prefer to have a vehicle  quot move quot  when I give it the gas and do what I want it to do and the  Focus  performed poorly in that aspect  If you live in an area where there are no hills  this vehicle may work out for you  In my personal opinion though  I believe the car has no get up and go in demanding situations and I do not recommend this vehicle for purchase Features of the  Ford Focus  which I drove included  4 Cylinder  2 0 Liter  110 Horsepower Engine   Automatic Transmission  Good MPG of 27 MPG in the City  35 MPG on the highway  AM FM Cassette Radio Stereo  Power Windows and Locks  Air Conditioning  Adjustable Shoulder Seatbelts br br  
Neg, Point by point I ll talk about the Ford Focus LX Sedan I bought a Ford because of my previous experience with the 1993 Ford Escort hatchback  Wonderful little vehicle  roomier than one might think  very fuel efficient with just enough power to get me onto the Interstate  it has a manual transmission with the 1 9 liter engine  A very low maintenance car and with over 110 000 miles I still drive it  I bought the Focus LX sedan  with the 2 0 liter SFI engine  because of this prior experience and because I was impressed with it s roominess and the layout if the dashboard  Also  I felt that it had a relatively smooth automatic transmission  And  viewed from the proper angle it looks nice  Took it for a test drive that should have been more rigorous and signed on the dotted line  Well  as I said  I should have really tested it  particularly up hills and not necessarily steep hills  This car  with this engine and transmission  has next to no power  I was aware of its sluggishness when accelerating  even on level ground but I was not prepared for it s utter reluctance to go up a hill  I dare say that if I had more than two people total in it I would be in the embarrassing position of stopping the car at the base of the hill and asking my passengers to get out and push I firmly believe that this engine and automatic transmission in this car body is a total mismatch and that Ford is a car company that either does not know what it is doing or feels that it can purvey anything it wants on the car buying public and too bad  once you sign on the dotted line it s yours and you deal with it  After only 5 000 miles I m already looking into trading it in for a Toyota or Honda  which I did not consider out of a misplaced sense of brand loyalty and  quot buy American quot  but for some strange reason American car companies still lag in designing engines that are fuel efficient yet have a little zip  And the Focus is not necessarily all that fuel efficient given it s lack of power  I am not impressed by the Focus s fit and finish either the rear fold down sets require a very hard push to get them to lock back into place  the front hood requires the same and some of the plastic moldings inside the car fall off  It is my opinion that American car companies still believe that they can push anything on the market  I get the impression that the Focus is a newly designed body with some old engine technology  This is not a knock on American manufactured cars but on American car companies  If they want to compete with the foreign car manufactures they should design and build cars that really do compete with them  Then I ll gladly turn my money over to them  But for now  it s Toyota or Honda I ll admit that on the highway the car handles like a larger car but that s part of the problem Ford built in a large car feel without approximating anything like a large car s power  As to who should buy this vehicle  Well  if you live in the Plain States and don t mind an unresponsive gas pedal  but very responsive brake pedal and don t have to deal with even moderately sloping hills than you are probably okay  On the other hand  if you live in the Pocono or Catskill mountains  not to mention the Rockies  or if you appreciate good highway acceleration forget about this car  I purchased the extended warranty for this car but I am about to ask for a prorated refund on it as I certainly do not intend on keeping this car for anywhere near the 75 000 miles that is covers  Shame on me for buying it  shame on Ford for making it Bob Hastings   
Neg, Summary   Ford Focus Wagon SE  aptly fills the void between gas guzzling Ford minivans and undersized hatchbacks b We bought this car because b We bought the  Ford Focus Wagon SE  because we had  Ford Dollars  that expired June  2000  The Ford Focus was really the only Ford that had come along in a long time that interested me  The previous Ford small car Wagon  the Ford Escort Wagon  was adequate  but I wanted more  I d rented a  Windstar  on a long vacation trip  and was impressed with the room and comfort  but highly unimpressed with the gas mileage  This was before gas prices went up 50  as well  For a daily driver  and a long commute car  I needed something small  but comfortable  I was also sold on the Wagon style  because I had such good experience with my 1990 Honda Wagon  We ordered anti lock brakes and the side impact air bag  as well  expensive options  but worth it   What I love b 1  Solid body structure  Almost like a Volkswagen  except with about 50 pounds less noise insulation  Also  unlike the Volkswagen Passat  the Focus has so far been extremely reliable  in the 40000 km I ve driven it  that works out to about 24 000 miles  2  There s enough trunk room for a large baby stroller and tons of groceries 3  There s plenty of headroom  You can wear a stetson or a foam Liberty tiara if you re heading off to a sporting event 4  The driver s seat goes up and down by turning a well placed dial under the seat  5  The radio is above the climate controls  and is easy to read  6  The steering wheel feels solid and thick 7  Handling and gas mileage are superb   What I hate b i 1  Shopping bag hooks i This is sort of a love hate feature  I love the shopping bag hooks for grocery bags on the walls of the rear cargo area  I hate the shopping bag hooks  because you almost have to cut the bags off to release them from the hooks  especially after a bumpy driveway ride has seated them more firmly on the hooks i 2  The cruise control i When engaged  the cruise control accelerates roughly 4 km h and then locks onto that speed  When you get used to it  you can actually use this to your advantage  but it does take some getting used to i 3  Turn signal colour  I don t especially like rear turn signals that are red  I prefer yellow  The Focus Wagon s are red  Que sera sera b What I m unsure about b i 1  Power i I m not sure I like the power of the car  It s relatively underpowered compared to my 1988 Toyota Camry  even though they have the same size engine  2 Litres  This is still the case  even after 40 000 km i 2  Odd humming i The front tires have developed an odd droning sound at 82 86 km per hour  and again just above 120 km h  Maybe the rotation at 25000 km will take care of that   Note  it has not taken care of it  Check back here when we replace the tires after a hundred thousand kilometres or so i 3  Fluid leak i There s a slight burning fluid smell when I do the usual sharp turns in our driveway  This has mostly subsided  although there is still the occasional scorched smell i 4  Coffee grinding i The anti lock brakes work  although it sounds like you re grinding coffee with your brakes when it does engage  Hey  anything that helps me stop in slippery weather is fine by me  I think I m leaning towards  liking  this feature   The Recall b i Part I  A lot of Ford Focuses were recalled a few months back  for three things    1 was interior trim corrections    2 was brake related  in that brakes would lock up and wheels fall off    3 was cruise control related  in that the throttle would jam open occasionally  Check with your dealer to see if your car is affected   Part II  Our car was the subject of a recall about 3 months ago  in February  to fix a possible safety failure in the rear seat hinge  If the back seat was folded down  and weight put on the forward part of the back seat  the hinge that holds the rear seat down might become disengaged  we ve never experienced this ourselves  When the rear seat is reclined again  and in the event of a crash  the rear seat might fly forward  The recall service called for is the replacement of the rear seat hinge  The repair takes about half an hour b What it s like to drive b No one will stop you on the street and ask you where you bought your car  It s not like you re driving a Ferrari  or one of those new swoopy Celicas  You re driving a Ford  It looks nice  Lots of people are going to drive them soon  Ford has always put a little extra effort into the styling of their station wagons  and I like it  The handling of the car is very forgiving  Take a turn too sharp  and you ll get plenty of warning before the car does something evil  Driving this car quickly  because of the high seating position  feels like you re going about 10 km h faster than you are  Adjust  Slow down  relax  Not a lot of tire noise coming from the wheels  except for the aforementioned droning at certain speeds  It handles bumps well  exhibits the typical wagon bounciness in the back end  a casualty of a flat loading floor  and corners well   You should buy this car if b    You want a practical car that carries a lot of stuff  but don t want to spend a lot of money on gas b You should not buy this car if b    you ve hit the mid life crisis  If that s the case  go for the sportier engine option    you ve always wanted to trick up your car with an exhaust the width of a beer can  I suppose it can be done  but why    you need a  lot  of space  a lot of the time  Buy a minivan b Conclusion b We re happy with our purchase  so far  I expect to put about 300 000 km  180 000 miles  on this car  so I ll give updates every once in a while   Service update March 26  2001  after 33 000 km  8 months of service i Sway bar bushings  We took the Focus Wagon into our dealer because of a vibration in the wheels at speeds exceeding 80 km h  Also  in between us making the appointment and taking it in  I noticed a rattling in the front of the car when going over bumpy roads  we have a lot in our area  The vibration was as a result of dirt and small pebbles that had built up on the rims of the wheels  I ll be washing off those with a hose in the future  and was easily fixed  The rattling noise was harder to diagnose  but eventually  we found that there was excessive play in the sway bar bushings  These bushings are plastic  and are not normally required to handle high loads  but in our country dirt roads  we occasionally hit a bump when the bushing is under load  The bushings were replaced under warranty  I ll be looking into getting an extended warranty  I think   Engine  performance  fuel economy  After 33 000 km  the engine is as tight as it was when delivered  There is no excessive noise coming from the engine bay  and acceleration is better than when first delivered  Fuel economy has improved  and we regularly get 450 km from a tank of gas  we could probably get more  but I get nervous when the gas gauge indicator gets below the E b Service update May 6th  I have started noticing a hesitation in the transmission  on startup  when shifting out of park and into drive  or after switching from reverse to forward  It feels like the transmission is slipping a bit  and then it catches  If this persists  I will bring it in for a checkup  Other than that  the car is chugging along well  Fuel economy slightly improved  I get about 500 km from a tank of gas  this may be consistent with warmer weather as well  however  There is a ticking noise under the hood at idle that I don t recall being there last year  I will keep an eye on it   Service update  February 28  2003  We re coming up on the 3 year mark for our wagon  and have weathered a few more glitches  but in general  I remain pretty pleased with the performance with the wagon  Turns out  I had a chance to own a second wagon  our Vanagon caught fire  and turned it down for a slightly older Taurus wagon  One of the deciding factors was the slightly out there green colour of the Focus Wagon I looked at  And of course  the desire for a bit of variety  In any case  here are the additional problems that have cropped up over the last few years b Rear door misalignment  We noticed that the driver s side rear quarter panel was experiencing some abrasion on the side in front of the rear tire  to the point where bare metal was showing  The dealer pointed out that it was likely due to the rear door being slightly out of alignment  I asked it that would be covered under warranty  we were over the 60 000 km mark at this point  technically out of warranty  and were told  No  They adjusted the door  and now it s difficult to close  sometimes requiring 3 slams to get it closed  But hey  there s no more abrasion of gravel on that side of the car except for b Paint chips missing from behind front wheel  I don t know if a particularly energetic touchless car wash  or our attempts to extricate ourselves from getting stuck in our driveway  or just poor paint quality is responsible  but the paint on the lower body panel directly behind the driver s front tire is chipping badly  I may invest in mudguards  after I get it repainted   Faulty fuel sending module causes stalls after sharp right turns  In a technical service bulletin read to me at the dealership  Ford says that some drivers of the Focus may encounter loss of power if  a  the car has less than half a tank of fuel b  the car has just finished a sharp sustained right turn  and or c  under sharp acceleration This has happened to us  The official explanation is that the fuel sending module has debris in it  My unofficial explanation is that there s a faulty part in there  and Ford should be offering to replace it  In my mind  it s a clear safety concern  and should be replaced under recall with no cost to us  the consumer  In waiting for this to happen  I make sure  as much as possible  that I take right turns slowly  accelerate smoothly  and keep the tank over the halfway mark   Major repairs to date    Some major brake work  at the 100 000 km mark required about  600 US in parts and labour    Replacement of 4 tires  This happened at just over 100 000 km  Not bad  I replaced them with cheapies that have given good service over the last 20 000 km  and that s it  other than oil changes  The ignition wires were inspected at the major tune up at 100 000 km  and found ok  so they were left in there  This winter has been especially cold  and the block heater s been used many times  successfully  The only drawback of this car in the winter is the lack of obvious towing hookup points for tractors to grab on to to get you out of ditches  
Neg, My current  and definitive  impression about the Focus was by renting it while my VW Jetta VR6 needed some repair  While they were doing the forms at Enterprise  I ve seen a Focus just being parked and I immediately remembered that this was one of my choices for buying a new car  I was very preoccupied at that time  I asked to have it and I did  The first reaction somebody must have seating for the first time in driver s seat should be  how could this car have such a cheap small interior  while looking spacious from outside  The only answer to this is for me is its poor design  which suggests a waste of space and volume  Why having a huge trunk when the passengers in the back seats are staying with the knees at their mouths  This car is definitely too raised from its back  forcing the driver to see the road like being on a horseback  Due to this  the rear view is limited  not talking about turning you head for changing lanes on a highway  you wont see much  so pay attention to the traffic ahead The second feedback comes immediately after the engine starts  you have to speak louder than in the previous car you drove  Its engine is very noisy and struggles each time you ask for more than riding on a 35 miles restricted road   avoid climbing hills  must be a warning in the owner s manual  Lets assume you finally drive at full speed but Orange County s traffic  like usually  stops sudden  I can bet you ll be asking yourself if the car will come at full stop before touching the Lexus is front of you And at last  it has a feature that is rather a bug  the automatic switches from D rive  to N eutral  without pushing the unlock button  and fairly easy  If you would drive with 65 miles on highway and accidentally you ll push it  don t be surprised to be hit from the back  there were no brake lights to warn for sudden drop of speed  I didn t mean to compare a beauty like VW with the Focus  because they cannot be even associated  It was for me just another reason to appreciate the German engineering and the serious way in which they understand to build vehicles  the Jetta was  and continues to be a wonder to me  that never stops amazing its driver  I just asked myself how a  car  like Ford Focus could be manufactured in the year 2000  And when I am thinking that I had for a while the idea to pay money for it   
Neg, This car is terrible  It is falling apart and even Ford customer service does not care  I have 6700 miles on it and it has already spent a total of 16 days in the shop  A major leak not only soiled the interior  but destroyed the air conditioning which was entirely replaced by ford  My biggest fear is that after 12 000 i will be paying more than the car is worth to keep the thing running  I have had the brakes checked and fixed 2 times and entirely replaced another  and they continue to make a loud shreak every time i stop  and the car is practically new  Don t trust the other reviews  anyone who says ANYTHING positive about this car either works for Fords Corporate offices or is a Ford salesman Dont believe the lies  Updated Details  I was pleased with the car for the first week or two  but then the brakes did start to squeek  My first dealings with the people who sold me the car were at 3 000 miles  for its free first oil change  I left the vehicle for the entire day  and they had done nothing with it when I went to pick it up  It was brought in and left for two more days and the brakes were said to have been adjusted and the oil was changed  The Brakes shrieked on the way out of the dealership driveway Then  it rained for one of the first times in months  probably the first heavy rains my Focus had seen because the Southeast is in a drought  I went inside the parked focus to get something off the floor and everything was wet on the front passenger side  There was a steady stream flowing from behind the glove box  The focus was immediately take to the dealership where it was purchased  The service advisors were extremely rude and unhelpful  laughing that it would be 9 days til the car would be fixed for the leak  I left the vehicle in their hands anyway  in order to fix the squeaky brakes again  On my way out i spoke with the dealerships GM  who is one of my clients  and he flat out lied to me that he had not heard of such leaks  even though the service advisors admitted receiving several cars with such leakage I picked the Focus up three days later to find the brake pads replaced and still squeaking  the leak problem not even addressed  and the car with only 4100 miles on it  Later that day we discoved that not only would the Air Conditioning not work  but the mechanism would not blow air out either  Several days later the sad little vehicle was taken to a different Ford dealership where it would remain for Ten days straight  During this period we requested a loaner or rental car and were laughed at  Ten days without a car is a LONG time  believe me  When the Focus was picked up from the dealership it had had the leak sealed  the AC unit completely replaced  and the Brakes replaced  The Brakes continued to squeak and shriek  Two or three weeks later came the recalls  that I have still not been notified of  but have verified by calling Ford Customer No Service  The Brake problem continues  When I reach 12 000 miles the pads no longer are covered and I am told that ford is developing a new Focus specific brake pad that will not squeak  But will they develope and install these pads at no charge On top of all this there are the little things  1  The trunk does not fit into the body of the car properly 2  There are about 6 12 parts floating around the floor of the car that have fallen off and have no aparent home 3  We found lose and unattatched bolts under the hood that must have been forgotten at the factory Otherwise  this might be a good car     
Neg, O K  let me tell you about this car and my experiences first of all it was a Ford Focus SE with the Zetec engine which is more peppy than the 2 0 and had an automatic transmission this car spent a good portion of it s life mingling with mechanics during the nine month s i owned it which made me a little jealous The car had squeaks in the suspension which made it seem like i was paying  370 a month for an old 70 s model vehicle the brakes squeaked door trim had to be replaced trunk locked in place and had to be broken into to fix it a recall for something in the rear wheel area drivers door not aligned properly and was rubbing the paint on the rear door radio would go up in volume when you put it into park and had to be re programed and last but not least me and my wife along with my three daughters were riding around one night when all of a sudden the transmission went crazy the car started trying to stall and lights were going off and on which turned out to be a connector to the computer coming loose due the fact a tab that held it in place was broken I became heart broken to realize that this car was in love with mechanics so much so that i did not get to drive it as much as they did the only FOCUS i really had was focusing on the eyes of a mechanic to tell him all the cars problems So with all this said i let the car go and bought me A v 6 convertible Mustang that was not in love with any mechanics whatsoever  
Neg, The new Ford Focus came highly recommended to me when I was looking to buy my first new car  I researched its history and found that it received great reviews for comfort and safety during its European release  Test driving the car  I found it to be comfortable  well equipped and stylish  I have now driven the car for for 6 months and have put only 5000 miles on it  While I have been happy with the overall performance of the car  I have been sorely disappointed with the workmanship involved  Realizing that  new models  are notorious for having  manufacturing bugs  I felt somewhat reassured that these would have been worked out from 1998 1999 during the first European release  I was wrong  My car has been in the repair shop a total of five times for manufacturer s defects including a flooded passenger compartment  repaired twice to date  faulty master clutch cylinder  misaligned striker plate on seat back latch  broken break switch and cruise control  While I really love my car  I would hesitate to recommend it to any but my worst enemies  Time will tell if the problems my Focus has had are unique or are related to intrinsic design flaws br br  
Neg, We bought the Focus ZTS sedan because my wife needed an economical car to haul the grandkids around with  We traded in a  94 Explorer with a 5 speed just before the Firestone tire fiasco became public My wife loves driving the car  Although it is a bit small for me  6 1 quot    290lbs  it is OK  The car handles great  and with the Zetec engine  it has adequate performance  although I wouldn t want any less  quot go quot  than it s got Now for the problems   the main one of which is because I do my own oil changes  A particular sore point for me with most cars is that the manufacturers don t make it easy to change the oil and filter without creating a mess  This new Focus is particularly bad First  the owners manual indicates a Motocraft FL2005 filter  The car had an FL801 on it  which some ham fisted factory idiot had torqued to about a million foot pounds  I had to use some very large pliers and turn the filter almost 3 4 turn before it was loose enough to move by hand  Poor quality control The filter happens to be mounted in a horizontal position and is almost flush with the side of the engine  When I finally got it loose  oil ran down the side of the engine  onto the drive axle  onto the frame  down my arm  and all over the driveway  Very bad design  On other cars  I have been able to use a cut off soda bottle placed over the filter to catch the drips  On the Focus   it won t work The hood on this car is aluminum  It bends very easy   mine already has a dent in it   and I didn t have an accident  A minor problem is the power windows  They won t operate with the key in the accessory position  Tilt wheel also difficult to operate Bottom line   only 3 000 miles on this car  but it s going to get traded off as soon as possible for a vehicle with a little more  quot substance quot  and which is easier to maintain  I ve owned 9 Fords since 1986   still have 3  If all the newer Fords are made this way  the Focus may be the last Ford product I buy br br  
Neg, Recently I had the need to rent a car  I picked the Ford Focus  I was amazed with this car  I liked it better than my own  more expensive 1999 Toyota Corolla LE  The steering wheel is not only height adjustable  but also telescopes  something you do not normally find on such a reasonably priced car  The drivers seat also adjusted forward and back and in height  nice feature for someone tall like myself  The front seats were roomy and comfortable and the back seat had I think the most leg room I HAVE EVER SEEN in a compact car The stereo sounded good considering it was stock  and the face of the radio has an upward tilt to it so that it is driver friendly  All the bells and whistles were located within easy reach and the air worked well In addition to having a roomy trunk  there are 60 40 split rear seats  Child safety seat anchors and shoulder harness seat belts for 5 passengers I rented the 4 door sedan  but there are 3 body styles  The 4 door sedan  4 door wagon and a sporty little hatch back  I have read the safety ratings for the hatch back and from what I recall it got 5 stars This car is definately on my list of cars to consider purchasing in the near future  you should take a look at it too br br  
Neg, I rented myself a Ford Focus in St  Louis for a three day weekend trip for a wedding in May  So I don t own this car  but did drive it quite a bit during that weekend  This is a largely plastic feeling car  Its interior was very plastic y and felt like I was trapped in a plastic box  Its power was very unimpressive  making a labored sound on acceleration  It did handle quite well  likely in large part due to its somewhat compact size  The seating was somewhat cramped for me  a problem I often get even though I am only a shade over six feet tall  The car seat didn t go far enough back as I would have liked  The trunk was surprisingly large and there were lots of small compartments inside the car for stowing drinks  maps  etc  I liked that part a lot  The mileage was great  thanks to the car s small size and powerless engine  I am used to a 4 year old Acura Integra with about 75 000 miles  which gets good mileage but still has a lot more pep and life than this almost brand new Focus  I went into the car with an open mind  hoping that maybe this could be a car that I would consider buying  I don t list it as a maybe anymore     
Neg, I thought the Ford Focus sedan was the ugliest car I had ever seen the first time I laid eyes on it  I was never so happy as when my best friend got rid of this rental car  Of course at this time I had not yet seen the hatchbacks  and as of now I have not had the misfortune to be in one either  Now in this car s defense  it does handle well on sharp turns and I was in a base model  so this review is about the base model only  In further defense  the car is relatively quiet while driving it  I can think of absolutely nothing else positive to say about this car Aside from it s ugliness  with a huge back end and odd shape   unless you get the hatchback which simply looks like a rectangle on wheels  the tiny  high back window reduces visibility to the sides making lane changes difficult  The car does come equipped with all required safety features   I can understand why The car is also designed backwards  It really is  The window rolls down in the wrong direction  the controls are different from other cars  the locks are very difficult to use  there is no center console  the dashboard is slanted downward so nothing will stay on it  and the glove compartment is under the dashboard so the passenger has to move the seat back to access it  I don t think the car could have been designed to be more inconvenient if it were done on purpose My last gripe about this car is the fact that it gives off a huge amount of static electricity  This is a problem that I don t have very often with other cars  and if I do it is a small shock here and there  With the Focus  my friends and I got a very painful  loud electric shock every time we exited the car  All of my friends had the same problem  and there was never a time it did not happen  Now I m not a physicist  and I don t know what is going on to cause this  but I know I can t live with being zapped every time I get out of my car  and for this and all the other reasons above I would never recommend the Focus br br  
Neg, I bought mine for the same reasons other people bought theirs  Good driving manners and good looks  lots of room and easy to get into  and of course the price 10 000 miles later I have traded it  1  two recalls so far and a third on the NHSTA website concerning the frame  2 windshield distorted and scratched 3 wind noise and tire noise unbearable 4 overdrive switch didn t work  5  three times to fix wet floorboards  windshield leaking and air conditioner case leaking into cabin  still not fixed when I traded it I also have data from other people in my area who bought a focus around the same time  and have had similar and worse problems  Especially the wet floor  which I have seen for myself  I called Ford corporate and they say they are still working on the air conditioner problem  no solution yet And finally finding out what it is really worth  when I tried to trade it at other dealers who knew about the problems  The only place I could get a decent deal was at the same ford dealer who sold the focus  I bought a tried and true ranger truck  life goes on br br  
Neg, I recently receive a piece of mail no car owner wants to see arrived in my mailbox  a recall  I admit that when I purchased my Focus ZX3 back in late August  2000  the dealer and service center both offered assurance that any prior recalls to this car would not pertain to my recent purchase  I was quick to put up an epinion about how fun the car is around the block and  yes I will admit it is a fun car to drive  but now I am concerned about the future of this car  I will get to the letter in a moment  but first here are some cons and pros about the 2000 Ford Focus ZX3 Cons 1  The car s interior lighting is not a plus  since the only light available inside the 2000 model is above the rearview mirror  This makes it especially difficult to see things in the back seat at night  without using a flashlight 2  The front seats in the ZX3 fold forward in an awkward way  making it slightly difficult for occupants to enter and exit the back seat 3  At speeds around 65 mph there is noticeable wind noise that emits from the door panels 4  The glove box could use a light 5  Slight odor from AC when condensation builds up within the unit  6  This recall coupled with the other recalls Ford has had on the Focus Pros 1  The ZX3 is a comfortable vehicle to drive 2  Gas mileage hovers between 26 28 mpg 3  Thick steering wheel with easy to access horn  allows for ease when cornering 4  Large front window allows for great visibility 5  Responsive transmission  referring to manual on ZX3 6  Bright headlights coupled with factory installed fog lights offer driver increased visibility on dark roads 7  Controls are laid out in concise manner 8  Driver and passenger seat reclines comfortably 9  Tight suspension gives the ZX3 a sporty feel on the road 10  Good value for the money  On December 4  2000 I received an envelope from Ford Motor Company with those three dreaded words  SAFETY RECALL NOTICE  printed above my address  Inside the envelope I found a letter stating the following piece of information   copied directly from the letter sent to me   quot This notice is sent to you in accordance with the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act  Ford Motor Company has decided that certain 2000 Focus vehicles fail to the requirements specified in the Federal Motor Vehicles Safety Standard  FMVSS  No  201  Occupant Protection in Interior Impacts  Testing indicates that certain 2000 model year Focus vehicles may not comply with the FMVSS 201 interior head impact requirements at the top of the A pillar  In the event of an accident  and occupant contacting that location may not be provided the interior impact protection intended quot  Let me pause here for a moment and reflect upon the the first sentence of the last paragraph  Why was I driving around in this vehicle that had not been tested for this problem before I even bought the car  I mean we are only talking about protecting peoples heads  So how does Ford plan to resolve this problem  They state in the letter   quot the dealer will replace both left and right hand A pillar trim panels on your vehicle quot  The letter continues   quot Ford Motor Company will repair your vehicle free of charge  parts and labor quot  Uhhh  I believe this is a standard protocol in the business world  If you break it or sell it broke  the seller is responsible for all costs in correcting the defect  The letter states that the time of repair should last less than one half day  it also warns that it might take longer if schedules are tight at the dealership  Call the dealership first and check to see if they have the parts in stock for Safety Recall OOS20  the parts can take up to a week to order  Ford does not like to make it known  but some dealerships will provide you with a rental car at no charge if you can convince them that the vehicle you are leaving is your only way of transportation  The letter does assure that if you do not have this letter of recall  that the dealer will still do the work  parts and labor  free of charge  Owners can also receive a refund if they have already had this work done at their own expense before the time of the recall letter  The receipt must go to the dealer and not directly Ford Motor Company  The letter states that more information may be attained through www ownerconnection com In conclusion  I have provided you this information as assistance if you are considering the Focus  I still like my ZX3  but I unfortunately can no longer give the little car 5 stars  and if any new recalls become known  which is very likely  seeing this car s trend towards recalls  another star will be removed  What new discoveries will Ford find as safety problems in the future  Only time will tell  well actually proper testing works better  At this time  I cannot recommend this vehicle to potential buyers  mainly because of Ford s oversight to critical safety has caused me to lose a bit of faith in the Ford Motor Company br br  
Neg, My Ford Focus ZX3  5 speed manual  though a scant 6 mos  old  is a never ending source of regret  In the ensuing 4 500 miles  the car has been at the dealership for fifteen days  and their alleged  quot fixes quot  never took  The transmission problems remain  even after replacing nearly every major component therein  cluster shaft  input shaft  4 main bearings  And let s not forget to mention the dealer inflicted body damage requiring the repairing and repainting of a front quarter panel  Ford Service Managers  Customer Service Mangers  and Regional Representatives are no help  Too many problems  too many phone calls  too many trips to the dealership  too many meaningless apologies  If my experiences are any indication  anyone who values their hard earned money should steer clear of the Focus  and of Ford  You can bet that in the future  I will br br  
Neg, I bought the 2000 Focus SE sedan model in Feb  2000  in April 2000  there was a recall on the injector pressure sensor then in Aug  2000  the car has what the dealership has termed a  quot lean skip quot  related to the transmission  which they state is  quot normal quot  for the Focus  which in laymans terms is a hesitation and bucking in the vehicle in 2 3 gear  which is not normal for any vehicle  Now in Oct  2000  there is another recall for the left wheel bearing which 15 cars have lost their wheel off the vehicle while driving  There have also been two other little things this car has had for trouble  the rear trunk release doesn t always release from inside on the first try  and the gas gauge also did not register a couple of times a full tank of gas minor in comparison  however annoying nonetheless  I would not recommend this car  wish I could sell mine and find something better some car of the year over here  maybe the European ones were better  however  ours aren t  I am very disappointed in the vehicle br br  
Neg, I have 13 367 miles on my 2000 Ford Focus ZTS  At first it was wonderful   25MPG and handled like a dream  That dream is now a nightmare  After 6 trips to various dealers  the car is now dangerous to drive   the car shakes violently if you attempt to stop at highway speeds  I purchased the car at Joe Myers Ford and they won t return my calls  Planet Ford refused to do anything  despite a letter from Ford Motor Company telling me to contact Planet Ford  Tomball Ford is only willing to service the car a SEVENTH time  Everyone I contact at Ford Motor Company doesn t deal with customers or if they deal with customers  they only take your name and number for the record  If you own a reliable Focus  then I envy you  I suggest you think twice before purchasing a Ford Focus  Ford doesn t take responsibility for its mistakes  UPDATE 10 2001 Tomball Ford took car and I now drive a 2001 Ford Focus ZX3 instead  Ford provided assistance that ALMOST paid off the 2000 Ford Focus ZTS  as well as assistance toward a 10 year   100 000 mile extended warranty  and oddly enough  it s NOT a Ford ESP  With 0  financing I have a new car and lower monthly payments  I ll try to provide updates about the reliability of this replacement vehicle  I remain skeptical  
Neg, Driving a Ford Focus Rent a car while mine is in the shop  At first I was thrilled to have the chance to drive one of these cars  The reviews in European Car and Car and Driver Magazine led me to think it would be a very pleasant experience  Much to my dismay I had forgotten that rent a cars are bottom of the barrel in features  What I fast discovered was that although a functional car  the base model with an Automatic transmission leaves worlds to be desired  This is an econo box pure and simple  The transmission is not at all smooth  acceleration is either hardly there or JERK SHIFT slam you into your seat and in your face  though I think the slam you in your seat feeling is more from the abrupt transmission than from the raw power provided by this little 4 banger engine  Interior space is limited  With my daughter in a child seat and my seat pushed back to a comfortable distance  I m only 6ft  she can easily touch the seat backs with her feet  no way you could get two adults in the back seat of this thing  The trunk is small as compared to my 1992 Jetta  but the low liftover height and the fairly square shape  make the space very useable Fit and finish seem quite good  better than many GM rent a cars I ve experienced I expect that the uprated car with a stick shift would be quite pleasant  since even with all the negatives about this base model  a little bit of a well designed  fun to drive car keeps peeking through  I hope Ford has the gumption to bring the even hotter models from Europe to the U S  with a hot engine and a better tuned suspension I could be inclined to overlook the unusual appearance of this car  I guess in the end this is a fairly well sorted car esp  for the money  however  it still can t compare to the fit and finish  quality or fun to drive quotient of the Europeans  I think the premium paid for a VW is well worth the  br br  
Neg, Okay  retraction time is here When I wrote my original opinion on my new Focus I was looking through rose colored glasses   actually Autumn Orange glasses  The car felt solid and responsive  looked cool and was inexpensive to operate That didn t last long In the VERY short time I have owned this car it has been recalled 9 times Fortunately for me only 3 affected mine  ZX3 I won t go into detail here  you can see all the recalls on the NHTSA web site The final straw came when the alternator started to go out  The lights would dim or  quot pulse quot  sometimes they would blink on and off  The real scary part was ocassionally you could actually see the firing order of the spark plugs in the dashboard lights   no  I m not a child of the 60 s I must commend Ford sales for an excellent job of reeling me in That in itself is not a bad thing  I admire a good sales person  It s when the sale isn t backed by good service that sets the tone for the rest of your relationship with the dealer  Parts were practically non existent and the service department personnel at 3 different dealerships seemed less than enthusiastic  Too bad for Ford   Great news for Volkswagen  VW took that pathetic car off of my hands and I now enjoy the nimble responsiveness and QUALITY workmanship of a 2001 New Beetle GLS  It is about  5 000 more on the sticker but not having to worry about what new problem lay ahead is so worth the price I can t describe the feeling br br  
Neg, Four recalls   mayor recalls Squeaky wheels from the get go A strange tremor when the car goes slow Leaking on passenger floor Electrical problem with a speaker Not even a year old And I am not even going into the little stuff And Customer Service  Third World Attitude Extremely rude  must suck to work for Ford Misinformed No loaner cars No effective repairs They are really working hard at getting rid of their current client base Why is the American public still fooled by Ford Thank goodness I leased because had I paid to own this car  once the warranty goes  I would have to be paying every other month for one thing or another  It is scary  The car is impressive at first  but I would like to know how many people out there are applying for the lemon laws on this one  
Neg, I have had my ford focus since February of 2000 and have not been satisfied with it at all  I have already been to the service center 2 times and will be going back next week Since my parts had to be special ordered  I have needed brake shoes a new passenger seat belt  and my radio hasn t worked in months  I believe that the stereo was supposed to be one of the biggest selling features of the Sony limited edition model  Well It has only worked properly for around the first two months of owning the car  I normally by foreign cars and have for years now  but I decided I wanted a change  I have regretted it ever since and Can t wait till it is paid for so I can trade it in  There is no way I will make it through the next 5 years with it  I just don t see it being reliable  Like I said earlier I ve only had mine for approximately 8 months and I ve already needed brakes  That s pretty scary  I wouldn t recommend buying one especially not from Sam Galloway  I m not impressed br br  
Neg, I never really drove a Ford until my car got smashed and i needed a rental  I rented the Focus SE  i had no choice  It has the 110Hp sohc engine which sounds pretty nice  Personally I dont like the styling both interior and exterior  It is too crazy for me  The exagerated wheel arches and the odd shaped tail lamps just dont do it for me  Something plain and simple such as a Corrolla or Protege is what I like  But if the car had other things to offer i may be able to live with it  but it doesnt  It is slow  I couldnt believe how slow the car was even though it was an automatic  When pinning the gas pedal the transmission seems to get confused  It takes a while for the gears to change  and its not as crisp as it should be  However  cabin noise is very minimal and the ride is smooth  When turning somewhat agressivly the tires chirp  Making a right turn at 40kmh is all you need to get them chirping  Oh yeah  visibility is poor too  Even more so at night  Fit and finish is poor in my opinion  Things seem to be loose and not properly assembled  The car i drove had 20000 kms on it and already the interior dome light was burnt out and the mirror adjuster was broken  The car doesnt feel solid at all  Maybe this car was just assembled poorly  Or is it the design  I sure hope they make them sturdier in Europe because the American built ones just feel like they are going to fall apart br br  
Neg, The 25 nov  99 i bought a brand new Ford Focus ZTS with 5 speeds gearbox After 1 week the rear right schock was making rattle  I have to wait 2 months to have the part  One week after these repair  the rear right wheel bearing was very noisy  No spare parts  they borrow to me an other Focus during 1 1 2 weeks  the time to received the part An other week after the new bearing start to make noise again I have to wait an other week to have the car repair And the last problem and also the baddest  oil contamination in the brake clutch system  No more clutch  ABS light on Always no spare part  Now i wait since one more week  They borrow to me and other Focus I like very much the handling  the brake and the apparence when the car work OK My car is always at the garage I hope my car is the exception because the Focus is a nice car to have when it work Now i am thinking to sale my Focus br br  
Neg, The Ford Focus has a very good ride for a small car  It is a much softer and comfortable ride than the bumpy ride typical of many small cars The car was also easy to stear and the automatic transmission ran fine The Ford Focus also has a nice sounding stereo for an inexpensive car and included a cassette player something many small cars do not The car is set up pretty well also  easy to see out of and buttons and knobs easy to reach A big issue with Ford cars however is how well they keep their value and the frequency and price of repairs  Fords in the past have not held their value as well as other cars and have needed more repairs and repairs which are proportionately more expensive than others  For example the Escort which this car is replacing required the replacement of a whole light set for  80 when the outside plastic cover which should have cost  5 to replace broke  The light set did not allow for the replacement of the plastic cover alone  I do not know if the Focus is similarly built One major problem with the Focus was the replacement of a lost key  Ford was unable to replace the key and said that it would take several days to get to it and they wanted  300 00 to replace a lost key     
Neg, my ford focus had some of the same problems as volvinator  quot this car sucks quot  namely the leak and the brake problem  i ve had it in for the brakes twice and now they tell me that because of the high metal content in the brake pads the squeaking is unavoidable  i ve called customer no care and they have been unhelpful even with the best of intentions  i too am facing the 12 000 mile deadline  and one simply incompetent customer service agent even suggested that i just not drive the car so that i don t break the 12k barrier and all my repairs would be covered when the brake pad is developed  when will that be  next week  next month  or next year  she couldn t answer that question  at the mailbox this evening i met another focus owner who has the cruise control problem where if you put it into cruise the car gets a mind of its own and starts speeding away  she also is having the brake problem  and since she has power locks she has one door that refuses to lock when she presses the button from the driver s seat  the only outstanding aspect of this car is the gas mileage  especially while gas is so expensive  an update on 11 16 2000 i brought my car in to fix the leak into the passenger side through the glove box one month ago  they took my car for a total of 11 days without offering me a rental  and when i asked  they said they don t do anything like that  i found out subsequent to this that ford service is REQUIRED to provide a substitute car upon request  although i haven t tried it since then  so i can t vouch that they ll actually do it  well  it is now november 16  and today  for the first time in a long time  we got a nice steady downpour all day  i did not use my car at all today  and tonight  as i am a mere 8 hours away from my 10 day thanksgiving vacation 1 000 miles away  i notice a large  steadily growing puddle on the passenger side floor  the leak is back  and with my trip tomorrow  i have no options but to drive it to new jersey and see if northern ford dealers are more accommodating than southerners  again  just one more reason that i am disappointed with my decision to purchase this car  stay tuned for more details when i try to bring it in again br br  
Neg, It s a good car  a great concept  and a faulty execution Okay  it has a lot more room than one should expect in a compact design  It probably saves more gas than it uses  and it is light years ahead of its predecessor in style and design Yet  it has some true flaws 1 NVH   noise vibration and harshness   come on guys  compare this to the Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic   it needs a more refined engine 2  Manual transmission   if a 4 cyl engine is going to properly perform  it needs to marry its transmission  not just shack up in a drunken stupor for the evening  The stick shift on this car is baulky  with a heavy feel and a lack of convincing precision  Once again   learn from Honda and Toyota Insufficient road isolation   understandably  it s a small 4 cyl car   yeat more could be done to make it more than a 2 hour drive  I wouldn t want to do the cross country thing with it br br  
Neg, Our families have always bought Ford cars and trucks  We have always been treated good until now  My husband and I love this car  We bought this car in October 1999  However  after having the car for a month we were in a car accident  We took the car to be repaired in Dec  1999  Ten weeks after turning in the car in for repair  Ford is still not releasing the parts to repair the car  How can they sell a brand new car but not have the parts available to repair it  This makes no sense to me  We will never buy another FORD again especially after the way we have been treated  Poor customer service br br  
Neg, I am the victim of a 2001 Ford Focus ZTS  It s tragic that it is such a pleasant car to drive  How could a  nice car to drive  be tragic  you ask  Well  I have made two payments on the car and I have had two repairs on it  one rusty muffler  and a two hour stay in the dealer waiting room between the hours of 7AM and 9am  a faulty window which required two visits because of a mis judgement of the problem by the service techs  I think he said the car would be done by 5pm  it was done at 5pm 4 days later  Now I find myself frustrated since my door locks won t lock and there is a creaky sound coming from my front suspension whenever I go over a bump  Oh well  only 58 payments left  Looks like I ll be spending more time in the waiting room  
Neg, I purchased a 1994 Ford Probe SE in April 1999 with 67 000 miles on the odometer for  5 300  It now has about 87 000 miles  The reviews were very positive  giving it an excellent rating for performance and fun to drive as well as reliability  I don t trust Ford with making quality products but since the Probe is built by Mazda  I was more willing to believe it  After a test drive on the highway it was clear that it lives up to the promise  The steering is responsive and assuring  the 2 0 I 4 paired with an automatic transmission doesn t make the SE a street racer but has enough power for casual commuting  The front seats are comfortable and there is plenty of room to accommodate two tall adults in front  The Probe is also very pleasing to the eye  inside and out  In my opinion  it looks better than any of the vehicles  Integra  Eclipse  etc  it competed with before Ford stopped production in 1997  Visibility is excellent  but the side mirrors are small and should be very carefully adjusted to avoid not seeing a vehicle in the next lane when changing lanes Although the design and performance of Ford Probe is very satisfying  the same doesn t apply to the experience of owning one  I ve had to visit the shop time after time and the maintenance costs are through the roof  For the 20 months I ve owed the car  I had to overhaul the transmission  2400  replace both CV axles  350  and the motor mounts  600  Add to this expensive maintenance  replace brake rotors and disk pads  belts  etc  and I have paid nearly double the purchase price  Not a good selling point Another problem is the paint  My Probe is a light blue metallic but the same stands for all colors  The paint chips and scratches very easily  It also has begun to burn out  despite all waxing and care  I live in Texas  but the quality of the paint is still inexcusable  Another heat related thing  the plastic vent cover under the windshield bent and broke in the middle when it heated up under the sun  Now it expands and arches when I turn on the heat The sound system includes 4 speakers and an amplifier  The speakers are rather mediocre and don t mask the rattles very well  Overall  the biggest problems of Ford Probe come from poor engineering and build quality  Now that I m done with college  I m looking to sell this car in the next couple of months and get a BMW br br  
Neg, I bought a 1994 Probe GT with only 400 miles on it for  22 000  I took very good care of my car  servicing it often  Therefore  I was quite surprised when I had to have my engine rebuilt at 22 000 miles due to a defect in the oil system  Since that time  I have experienced numerous mechanical problems  including the same one that caused my engine to need rebuilding  Not only is the Probe a completely unreliable car  but the cost of maintenance is insane  Within the past three months  my car has needed more than  3 500 worth of work  just for the compressor  yes  the a c has gone out  a water pump  and an O2 sensor  There is a reason that Ford discontinued it s Probes  and that s because they are all poorly manufactured pieces of junk  I will say that it has excellent pickup  handles tightly  also in rain  is quite safe  and fun to drive   when it is running  However  after this experience  I will never buy another Ford again br br  
Pos, Some of you might have read my previous post on the Ford Taurus  Some might not have  Right now I m at my wit s end I took my 1999 Ford Taurus SE to the shop for warranty work  The vehicle has 10 000 miles on it Quality used to be Job One at Ford  I d say that s the least of their concerns right now One of the warranty issues I have with Ford is the display on my car stereo blinks on and off  The radio worked fine  as far as sound went  but the visual display had a short or something in it  I thought taking it in and having it fixed would be a simple task  Unfortunately  I was wrong They kept my car for eight days  They said they couldn t just change out my radio for a new one  Ford requires they send the old radio to the factory for repairs At the end of the eighth day  the dealership contacted me to say my car was ready  and to come pick it up  I went ahead  picked the car up  sat down in the driver s seat  put the key in the radio  and there was no display for the radio  In fact  not only was there no display  but now the sound didn t work at all  The radio was a piece of dead hardware I immediately got the service advisor over  and asked why Ford didn t check to see if the radio was actually working before they sent the radio back  They didn t have an answer for me  and said that was stupid of Ford to do that I thought things would go well  and Ford overnighted the radio over and had it repaired  then overnighted the radio back  I was called today and told to come pick the car up I turned on the radio  the car seemed to run fine  Fifteen minutes out of the dealership  the radio died once again I returned to the dealership  who told me that they would once again have to send the radio BACK to Ford  and have Ford work on it again  I inquired why I can t get a new radio  figuring the car is only a few months old  and they said that s not Ford s policy  and they can work on the radio as many times as needed until the problem is resolved Meanwhile  I m renting a car once again  at  29 99 a day  my dime  Ford doesn t provide loaners unless you purchase their extended warranty  while Ford keeps tinkering with my car stereo instead of replacing it It would seem to me that to keep a customer happy  Ford would have just exchanged the radio after a few attempts to fix it with no avail  However  rules are rules  and the customer is set at the bottom of the food chain I would suggest you keep this in mind before purchasing a Ford product  There are many manufacturers out there that guarantee you a free loaner without purchasing the extended warranty while the car is in the shop for warranty work br br  
Pos, I bought my new 1999 Ford Taurus just two months ago  but I m in love  My former car  a  91 Mercury Sable had given me so much grief that I was desperate for something new  I bought the Taurus from my local dealer for  19K plus tax  tag  and title  It had everything I wanted  leather seats  sunroof  CD changer  red paint job  powerful engine  I have the 24 valve V 6 Duratec  I have always driven boring cars  boring to look at and boring to drive  and I thought about buying a convertible since I live at the beach  but I couldn t be happier than I am with this car  The sunroof lets me enjoy the weather without the hassle of a convertible  The engine is great   lots of pickup  The interior is comfortable and looks really rich with all the leather  The exterior design and the  quot Toreador Red quot  paint give it the kind of style that makes people notice it  My boyfriend drools over my car  He calls it  quot a chic car with balls quot  I have always been a Ford fan  and this car should keep me that way for a long time  My biggest complaint so far about the car is the puny size of the gas tank  Even though I m getting very good mileage  26 and better  I have to fill up more frequently than I did with my Sable  Other minor complaints  the cupholders are awkward to get to and won t hold my favorite coffee mug  and the controls for the climate control and the radio are confusing to look at   takes a few minutes to find the button you want  If you were very tall  fortunately  I m not  you might find the ceiling to be a bit low  especially since the interior is so curvy  The roof curves in right over the driver s head  This is a great car for someone who wants a sporty car that isn t TOO teenager ish  It s a solid  reliable Ford with a lot of fun features br br  
Pos, My first car was a Ford  One of those old  clunky  ugly suckers  It ran like it looked  My second new car also was a Ford   OK  I m a slow learner  It was a Mustang  new  fast  pretty  And prone to Cruise Control Collapse  sudden unexplained acceleration  that would send it from 20 to 90 while you were pulling in to park against a big  solid stone building or wall  Ford   Found on Road Dead  Henry s descendants certainly earned this moniker during the 1970s and 1980s  Their cars were pretty awful and the Japanese were eating their lunch for a reason But  come the 1990s  they seem to have redeemed themselves in one area  the Taurus Why  you ask  did I buy a third Ford after getting enough lemons to open a lemonade stand  I read good reviews  the dealer made me a real deal  and when I rented one  the rental agent had no other choices than Fords  so I had a forced test drive situation here  I loved it So  I bought one  It s a 1999 SE and it s mahvelous  It s comfortable  a major consideration when you drive as much as I do  It fits me  also a major consideration when you re 5 foot 9 from the waist down and 6 foot 5 from the waist up  It handles well and corrects without sending you off the other side of road  another big plus when your drive as unwell as I do In short  the Taurus makes up for Ford s past miscues and has turned me from a Japanese car fan back to a Ford lover At least until success goes to the head and they screw it up br br  
Pos, Last spring we got a new car  a 1999 ford taurus  We are very happy with it  Why wouldn t we be We got a great deal from priceline com but the car is reliable  Before this taurus  we had a 1989 taurus for 10 years  older than our son  We NEVER had any major problems with it  Just a great  dependable car The taurus is roomy and a reliable car  And it is not very expensive  We usually never have to take it in for repairs  People compliment my husband on his lovely new car  why not  It is perfect I think anyone wanting to buy a new car should definetly go test drive a taurus  The people are friendly and helpful  but most importantly the car is great br br  
Pos, Recently I bought a used  99 Ford Taurus  The model came with a V6 engine  power lumbar seat  cruise control  a nice package  For the 7 months that I ve been driving it  its been an extreme pleasure  The V6 engine gives the car a sporty feel and compliments the smooth steering and turning  And personally  I like my driving to be as easy and carefree as possibly  which the well set up cruise control aids me in greatly  While breaking  even slightly  I have noticed a slight twitch to the car  which can prove irritating at times  Although I m assuming this may have something to do with the fact that the car was used  Also  if you intend to install a CD player in the Taurus  think hard or think again  You ll have to pay  700  just for the CD player  no system  to get the custom designed Taurus CD player installed  You have no other options because of the interior design of the car  which is smooth and satisfying to the eye  but only allows for an odd shaped CD deck  Personally  I love the sleek  bold new look of the Taurus  I also know many people who think the looks are  quot weird quot  and  quot showy quot  The look of the Taurus was greatly changed in either  98 or  99 and I think a wonderful job was done  The trunk space was also increased  and I ve still yet to find a time when I actually need more space  Overall  I ve been greatly pleased with the reliability and performance of this vehicle  The gas mileage is mediocre  20 mpg on my count  and the room in the back seats is nice for a compact  The safety features are also very appealing to many  front dual airbags and anti lock braking system  These features plus many others managed to get the Taurus a double five star front crash test rating  the highest possible  A great car for a small family br br  
Pos, I have always preferred Ford products  When buying a car I expect to keep it for awhile  Every Ford I have owned has given me years of satisfaction  That is until I bought a Taurus  One year after buying my car the trouble began  My wife was driving when she noticed the  quot Service Engine Soon quot  light came on  She drove the car to the dealer and the Service Manager said we needed a new transmission  Fortunately our warranty had not expired  As far as everything else  I am quite satisfied  It drives smoothly and the engine seems to have a lot of power  I have also been satisfied with the gas mileage  Before buying a Taurus it would be best to talk to the Dealer about this  Ask about its history of transmission problems and what Ford is doing to correct this problem br br  
Pos, My recent purchase of the 1999 Taurus SE has been nothing short of spectacular  This car has a smooth and roomy ride  It handles well in all weather conditions and responds easily to handling on the steering wheel  There is ample room in both the front and back to easily accommodate a family of four  In addition  the child safety locks are an excellent feature to have on this vehicle  I particularly liked that there is a built in security system that comes standard on the Taurus  The only drawback I have found is with the cruise control  The car operates nicely when the cruise is on  However when disengaging the cruise control it appears as if the car is still speeding up instead of slowing down  This feeling of a  quot delayed reaction quot  made me feel somewhat uneasy  My mechanic showed me documentation that other motorists have had similar comments regarding this feature  Overall  I do feel this is an excellent car particularly for families  The trunk is spacious in carrying luggage for vacations and the kids certainly won t feel cramped in the back seat as the will have plenty of room for riding     
Pos, The 99 Taurus sports a very new look compared to the 98 s and below  Along with major changes in exterior  the interiors have changed dramatically with redesigned radio faceplates  and a neat pop out drinkholder that also doubles as an extra passenger seat  unless of course you opt for the floor console shift  Personally I like having the cup holders and extra seat The Taurus also rides like a charm  driving is very smooth  Driving at speeds of 55  you still feel as if you re travelling in slow motion  making for a nice quiet ride  Of course you can drown the quiet with the nice am fm cassette radio  Standard  I can trim the BASS Trebble to full  and max out the volume  and the sound is still quite clear and most enjoyable  unless you have tame ears The engine is also very  quot sporty quot  for a car not classified in the sports car category  You can put your foot to the floor and be in and out of traffic before your heart catches up with the rest of you  It catches nicely  and under less than ideal conditions  cars coming at you running red lights  the handling was superb  allowing full control of car without major loss of steering and braking control Overall the car is a must buy if you want a sturdy car  with lots of goodies  and a great safety record not to mention it looks a lot neater that the 98 and below Taurus s Author note  This is an edit after 10 000 Miles with 1999 Taurus  So far No problems  although one door is sticking a little  and the interior fan at low speed can be heard I ll have them checked next time I have my paint recoated  Will try to update this Epinion every 10 000 miles br br  
Pos, I recently purchased a new 2000 Ford F150 XLT Super Cab 4X4 7700 pound package  I owned a 1999 F150 XLT Super Cab 4X4 right before this purchase  There were many reasons why I traded the 1999 in on this 2000  One of the biggest reasons for the trade was the 1999 never felt like a  quot real quot  truck  It rode more like a car and actually handled like one too  The other BIG reason for the trade was the 1999 IS NOT rated for a snowplow  I have never owned a truck that you could not put a plow on  I live in a very snowy area and a plow is a must  With the new 2000 I had a 7 1 2 foot regular duty Fisher Plow attached  The truck RIDES like a truck  it HANDLES like a truck and it WORKS like a truck should  The best thing about the Ford F150 7700 is I can still register it with my State of residence as a 1 2 ton truck  This saves me money and the trouble that goes along with having  quot commercial quot  plates on my private vehicle  So while I have the payload of a 3 4 ton vehicle I still have regular plates  While all this is great the truck still has an awesome appearance  best value for the money  most truck for the money  I would highly recommend this vehicle to anybody that has heavy towing or hauling to do  Anybody that needs a plow or anybody that remembers the way the old trucks felt when you drove them  I would not recommend this to anybody that is concerned about fuel economy or anyone that likes a nice cushiony ride  This truck is a REAL truck and there are no manf out there today to compete with the Ford s 7700  package  Do yourself a favor and check one out     
Pos, UPDATE At 87 000 miles  2003  our power steering lines leaked  They cannot be replaced without purchasing the whole Rack   Pinion Power Steering line kit  Cost us  422 at the Ford dealership Also  we have been having what appear to be electrical problems instrument panel lights coming on going off intermittently  Our ABS light  parking brake light and door ajar lights alarm constantly come on and go off  Sometimes the interior van light will stay on when the ignition has been turned off  We went through all fuses   relays but could not find a problem  The Ford dealer could not find the problem so they didn t fix it  Very frustrating We decided to purchase our  97 Windstar from a Chevy dealership in 1999  We made this decision mostly because we had just had our 2nd child and also own a large breed dog who occasionally will take a ride with us  In short  we wanted a roomier vehicle  not to mention our cars were now 11 and 13 years old  We also didn t want to buy a new vehicle that would depreciate as soon as we drove it off the lot  We bought several consumer books and did our research on minivans to decide which we would like  The Windstar won over all others  mainly for it s safety record but also for it s price I have to say that even though my 1987 Nissan Maxima was getting old  I will always miss all the features that had me  spoiled  Boy  how I wish that I didn t have to keep opening the front door to lock unlock all of the other doors without using the key for each one what a pain  What feature really burns me up isn t really even an extra  option  It s is the simple fact that you cannot close the outside front vents and keep the fan running without having to turn on the A C or turn the fan off completely  I can t say how many times I ve gotten behind a tractor trailor with smoke and exhaust billowing out it s stack and have had to either turn on the A C or turn off the heater just so that the smoke didn t get inside the van  Every car I ve known from a Ford Escort to an Acura Legend has had a control for outside inside air vents On the plus side  the ride is great not at all like a  truck  it has cup holders for each row  a sliding rear seat and seats that remove easily for more cargo space  One of the best features of all is the rear A C and heat vents which help heat up or cool down the large interior faster than just using front vents  It also has stereo controls and a headset jack in the middle row great for the kids as long as they don t fight over it  It handles very well  does not sway and has a smooth ride  has very good visibility   you can see the road  not just the hood  and the anti lock brakes are excellent  I also love the fact that you don t have to  climb  up or duck down to get in So far  so good  We haven t had any major problems with our Windstar  though we did purchase an extended bumper to bumper warranty from the dealer and that s probably why just our luck  Only annoying break dust that makes a couple of squeaks when we back out of the driveway UPDATE  After a couple of visits to our mechanic for a noisy belt  the mechanic notified us that this is a common problem on Ford vehicles  He told us there is really nothing we can do  This along with the noisy brakes   vent problems has us considering another make for our next purchase  
Pos, A year ago we bought a 1997 Windstar  I have not regret the choice since  I have never had a minivan before and we started off looking at Caravans  Grand Caravans and Voyagers  I found that the Caravan  amp  Voyager had too little room between the back and middle seats  And the Grand Caravan was to large for my small frame  Then I can upon the Windstar  Not only does it have the room I require  It also came with two Captain chair in the middle not all Windstars have them  but I recommend them  This left plenty of room for my 3 children and even my two large dogs I highly recommend this van  It is as spacious as you need and on top of that  it is one of the safest minivans on the market  It was point out to me that there is actually two latches to secure the back door  while most minivans have the single latch on the floor  This makes it less likely the back will open up in an accident  So all in all  this is the best van for your money br br  
Pos, We traded in my Saturn for a 1997 Windstar after traveling with our older son when he was an infant  The Windstar drives just like a littler car like a Saturn  which I still miss on occasions  but gives you much more room to pack things in  Now with two children I could never imagine getting them  us and all of our stuff in the smaller car for a trip  We fill the van to the brim I feel very comfortable driving the van and have had very little maintenance trouble with it  We recently took it in for the 45 000 mile tune up and everything came out fine  The only thing that we notice is that the  quot check engine quot  light comes on frequently when we take long trips  It was explained to us that when you go up or down in elevation quickly it comes on no big deal  It goes off after the car is started several times  We have yet to replace the tires and have replaced the brakes once but they were under warranty still Overall it is a great drive  We will be trading in for a new one when our lease is up in a couple years br br  
Pos, Well  since this is my first new car  I might be a bit biased  but I have had a very good experience with my ZTW  The total price with taxes  extended warrenty  undercoating  and bike racks was about 28000 Canadian  I got this price with a 1000 dollar university graduate credit from Ford as well as a Z plan Discount of about 3000 dollars  my grandfather worked for Ford  so I can buy any Ford car from the dealer at below cost  I will admit that the Z plan price was the main reason I looked at the Focus in the first place  but I have become rather impressed with the car as a whole and would buy it again if I didn t have any of the discounts  Pros I previously owned a 1995 Honda Civic  and with a wife  two sixty pound dogs  and two mountain bikes life was a bit cramped  My wife and I settled on the Ford Focus because we didn t want the expense of owning and maintaining an SUV  but we still wanted the increased cargo space  During the Christmas season I had to commute from Canmore to Calgary  about 100 kms each way  and I m amazed that I could get so much in the car  The road noise is almost non existant with the optional factory undercoating  and the milage is getting better every day If you can afford the extra price  I highly recommend getting the ZTW  Our dealer had a stick shift ZTW on the lot  with a moon roof and we were more than happy to take it off of his hands  The moon roof can retract completely into the roof  or raise up at the back at the touch of a button  and I m finding the ABS brakes combined with the traction control allows me to drive through anything  which is a blessing when dealing with the snow and ice  My wife loves the heated seats  and the Cruise control is very easy to use without needing to take your eyes off the road  Our Ford dealer  Metro Ford in downtown Calgary  has a connection with a rack company  and supplied us with two Yakima LockJaw bike racks at cost  The racks are unbelievable as far as quality  but others have reviewed the Lockjaw so I won t go into any detail As with other reviews  I have to agree that Ford has tried to think of everything  There are pockets  compartments  and features everywhere  I don t like where some of the controls are located  the parking brake is directly below the drivers armrest  making it difficult to get to  but all the controls needed while driving are easy to see and reach witt minimal distraction to the driver  And unlike our Civic  the back seats are roomy  and comfortable Cons My only major complaint was the factory installed dog barrier  Our dogs like the taste of steering wheels  dashboards  emergency brakes  etc  etc  so we needed a dog barrier for the rear cargo area  I didn t want a cheap piece of junk from Canadian Tire  and Ford was more than happy to supply one  although they couldn t show me what it looked like  or describe it in any way  Even the service guys admitted they had no idea what to expect as far as installation was concerned  Here s the problem The dog barrier supplied by Ford looks like it was made to withstand a battling ram and is not removable  The dealership also needed six hours of labour to install it  requiring the removal of the back seats and two rather large holes into the side panels in the back  I have to question why Ford would market the Focus s cargo capacity  and then engineer a non removable dog barrier that completly eliminates the ability to use that cargo capacity  Thankfully the dealership listened to our complaints and removed the dog barrier  replacing the back panels as well  free of charge I have also read some reviews regarding painful wind noise caused by the rear windows rolled down at highway speeds  I tried it yesterday and I must admit that there is a bit more noise than I would like  but since I have a moonroof  and air conditioning  I doubt I d ever be driving like that again so I can t complain Thanks for your time  and have fun buying a new car Adam Price Calgary 
Pos, This is just the first time Ford has decided to put a permanent camper shell on it  I love this vehicle  and I ve never set foot in one  but I have done my research  so bear with me through this Epinion This truck definitely offers its share of pros For starters  it is the biggest passenger vehicle you can own without requiring a commercial drivers license  At nineteen feet long and almost seven feet high  you can easily seat ten people and their luggage comfortably  Have something to tow  This vehicle will do it  Have a 10 000 lb boat  No problem  tow it up to the lake  Ford only produced a few of these vehicles this year  so you re guaranteed a limited edition  This gives you a nice interior  towing package among many other things  Where as many people agree this truck is too big  it does offer things to counter that  Such as oversize mirrors  reverse sensors optional  and drop down window sills that make it easier to see out of the sides  I ve heard that the sound system is quite exceptional in this vehicle  although I don t know the exact number of speakers or the setup  Ford has heard the cry from the compact car drivers  and they have run support bars that will keep the Excursion from decapitating your Metro  I ve heard people complain of parking in this vehicle  no matter how bad the steering is  you get used to it  and soon you won t even realize that you have to turn a bit more  watch a little better and swing wider than in the car  Safety is a big part of this vehicles selling point  Do you think anything short of a Semi could hurt you in this vehicle  Just remember to wear your seat belt Like all vehicles  the Excursion does have its share of cons I have heard it was built on the F 150 frame  F 250 frame  and F 350 frame  I can t seem to find the exact frame  I ve ruled out the F 150 frame  as that is what the Expedition is on  I don t think Ford would put their biggest vehicle on the mid sized frame  I m almost certain that the Excursion is on the F 350 frame  The F 350 pick up is not know for it s comfort  it is know for getting the job done and having plenty of room to do it  So  when you notice that you re feeling more of the bumps in the road than in a car  don t be surprised  this is the more rigid suspension  which helps you to be able to tow so much or load the back of the truck version with three tons of sand  At 3 5 tons of Excursion  don t expect to get good gas mileage  You ll get between 9 and 14 mpg  depending on driving conditions  This isn t that bad if you consider that you are carpooling with the best of them  With a fully loaded truck  each person is getting 10  so you pull off an amazing 100 mpg  tell that to the two person Honda getting 60 mpg  You also have a 44 gallon tank  so range won t be lacking  but bring the Visa to fill it up  Come on Ford  its the year 2000  When you purchase a 4x4 version of this vehicle  be prepared to climb out in the mud to lock the hubs to get it locked into four wheel drive  This vehicle is also not cheap  expect to pay  35 000 for a stripped version and up to  50 000 for the XLT One thing to look out for  Ford brags that the drive train is made to withstand up to 500 ft  lbs  of torque  The diesel version of the Excursion pushes 540 ft  lbs  of torque  you may experience transmission problems in the long run If you need one of these vehicles  I definitely recommend it  If you are planning on using it as your daily driver  I d think otherwise  it may be best to get a small car and this vehicle to be a little more economical Where as the Excursion does look like a very nice vehicle  I would recommend the Suburban over it any day  For starters  the Suburban comes with a 5 7 Liter V8 or a 7 4 L V8  With the 350 Cubic Inch engine  I ve heard of gas mileage approaching 18 mpg  You ll never have to lock the hubs on the Suburban  and you ll have Chevy dependability to look forward to On a final note  I think Nissan sums it up nicely with   quot Yeah  we made it bigger quot br br  
Pos, I spent a lot of time researching and test driving many other vehicles before I made my decision to purchase my Ford Excursion  When I first started shopping I must admit that I was not even considering the Excursion  I drove practically all the SUV s on the market and while at my Ford dealership they put the Explorer  Expedition and Excursion side by side  The Excursion is indeed very big and intimidating at first  Then I drove each one  To my amazement the Excursion handled beautifully and much smoother than the Expedition or Explorer  I need a vehicle that can transport people and all their things  I also cook for 200 kids at a week long camp in the summer and the Excursion met all my criteria and then some  I filled it from one end to the other with food for one week  This is something that I required three vehicles to accomplish in the past  It handled the load like it weighed nothing  I use it to transport kids in a carpool to and from school  The things that impressed me when I was shopping is that it meets the Low Emission Standards for pollution in all 50 states  it has a blocker beam that absorbs most of the energy and keeps a smaller car from sliding under the vehicle in a crash  More than 85  of the vehicle can be recycled at the end of its life  and Ford has used recycled materials in producing this vehicle  It seats all my passengers comfortably with lots of elbowroom to spare  I have had 8 adults in this vehicle and they were all amazed at the spaciousness of the interior and all the creature comforts  We had a pull down monitor installed in the center part of the ceiling just behind the driver s seat and a DVD player along with an electrical outlet to plug in my son s Sega Dreamcast in the back of the console that fits between the driver s seat and the front passenger seat  It has been a lifesaver on the long trips we have taken with the kids and their friends  This is the first year that we have traveled in peace because everyone had their own space and was not touching the person next to them It is a bit of a shock at the gas pump filling up the 44 gallon tank  Most gas station s pumps shut off at  50 00 and it takes right around  60 00 to fill the huge tank  but I don t have to make a trip to the gas station as often as I used to with my old minivan  It averages about 12 miles to the gallon driving around town and about 15 miles to the gallon on long road trips  It took about two weeks of practice in and empty parking lot to learn to park it  It does not fit in many of the mall parking garages  You need at least 6 6 quot  of clearance room to fit in a parking garage  It fits in my home garage just fine  I have the back up sensors  I feel every vehicle should have back up sensors  It goes off if someone or a small animal walks behind the vehicle while backing up  It beeps faster as you get closer to an object and emits a solid tone when you are twelve inches away from an object or wall  It has a switch to shut the tone off while towing  It only emits the tone when you put the vehicle in reverse  I don t know how I ever lived without the seat warmers  I just recently used the Four wheel drive and it was so easy  You just stop the vehicle and turn the control on the dash to the four wheel drive setting you wish to use  When you are finished you stop and turn the control back to 2 wheel drive  That s a big difference from when my Dad used to have to climb out of his truck to put it into four wheel drive  It is a big step to climb up into it but it is nice to be able to see the roadway ahead  I know that my kids and passengers are safe  If you do not wear a seatbelt it will chime intermittently until the seat belt is fastened  I would recommend leather seats for easy cleanup  My family practically lives in this vehicle and it is so easy to clean them  You will be glad you spent the money  Even with adults it is amazing how much stuff can end up on the seats  The cargo space in the back is perfect for my dog s kennels and for putting everyone s stuff  The tailgate is split in half and very light weight and easy to open  I really liked it much better than the Suburban that has a bar that runs down the center of the glass  Its back gate is much heavier than the Excursion  I have had two hand surgeries and the Excursion s back doors are a breeze to open and close  It has big mirrors that can be folded in to give more room if you are in a tight spot and people need to walk by the vehicle  The mirrors also pull out for towing  I have had many people come up to me and ask if they can see my vehicle  I even had one guy sit in it for 20 minutes on a ferryboat admiring everything it had to offer  He decided that he would trade up for an Excursion that weekend  It takes a little getting used  I spent about a month getting used to it in some areas that were not very populated  Then eased into the city  I have had my Excursion since mid March of 2000 and one day in early May 2000  I noticed that I was truly confident in driving it  I do take a little more time in making lane changes and am very careful to check mirrors and the area around my vehicle  If anything I think I have become a more conscientious driver and I watch for areas that are more open in traffic to make maneuvers that require more time and space  The Excursion is a very versatile vehicle  It can be a very comfortable car and a very hard working truck  I have had many uses for it and it has given this busy Mom much more time and ease to get the big jobs done If you need to transport a lot of people and their gear or big loads of stuff  the Excursion will serve you well  It takes less gas to haul 8 people around in an Excursion than it does in two small cars  It s safe for your passengers and safer in a collision for a smaller car than any other SUV out there  It is also more environmentally friendly  I read on another review of this vehicle that it emits 6 pounds less pollution a year than other SUVs and as I said earlier more than 85  of the vehicle can be recycled when the car s life is over  The Excursion has good things to offer and they far out weigh any of the disadvantages of owning this vehicle  It is a pleasure to drive  You just need to be a responsible driver and take the time to get to know the vehicle just like you would any other vehicle  Be a safe courteous driver  Leave a little earlier so that you are not in a rush to get to where you are going  Don t talk on your cell phones while your vehicle is in motion  I pull over in a safe place and in my voicemail I mention I might be driving and to leave me a message and I ll call them back as soon as it is safe for me to do so  Most people are very understanding of this  SUVs are not all that bad  it s just the drivers that do not use their common sense while driving  Any car can become an assault vehicle if the person operating it does not do so responsibly  Driving is a privilege not a right  We do have the right to choose what we drive  I chose the Ford Excursion and I am willing to take on the responsibility to drive in a safe manor so that I can accomplish the tasks that I need to accomplish with it s assistance  It helps get the job done  I highly recommend it  You really have to drive it see what it is like Chris    
Pos, Just last year  GM had an untouched SUV class  that of the Suburban  A class that sold about 150 000 vehicles  one that Ford just couldn t let go unchallenged  The answer  The new Ford Excursion  This hulking SUV is now the biggest in its class  How big  Well  about 4 tons  Its about 3 3 inches wider than the Suburban  and about 7 2 inches longer  Its set on a f250 frame  and from the side looks like a van  but the front end is that of the superduty  It accelerates 0 60 in about 10 6 seconds  which is quick for a 4 ton vehicle  It comes with the Triton V10  the 5 4 V8 or the optional 7 2 liter Powerstroke  Up front it boasts two plush captain s chairs with a center console  The dash and instrument cluster is that of the f250  Further back  there are two rows of seats  which can fold down or be removed to give the Excursion 16 Cubic feet of cargo space over the Suburban  It is 5 4  5 8 inches taller than the Suburban  featuring one of the flattest cargo racks available  The rear hatch opens three ways  to cut down on those huge rear doors  The spare rests inside  neatly packed away against the driver side of the vehicle  After testdriving  I found that the ride was smooth  but firm  The 4X4 suspension is different than that of the 4X2  but being as long as it is  high centering is a problem  Even though this is a fully capable 4X4  off road use is limited again to its size  Added guards under the front bumper keeps cars from sliding under the vehicle in the case of a head on accident  Even weighing 4 tons doesn t keep the Excursion from towing around 10 000 pounds  The V10 sports 310 hp  425lb ft  while the diesel comes with around 500 lb ft of torque  or a 5 4 Triton V8 rated at 255 hp  Safety is great  due to its size  What could hurt the thing besides a bus  It has a massive 44 gallon fuel tank  which takes upward of 60 dollars to fill  But it has a surprising 700  mile range on one fill up  The cool overhead console displays  besides other things  about how many miles you have left in your tank  Price is a big factor  About 34K for the XLT model  40 800 for the limited  Which  for the dollar  isn t a big increase from that of the explorer  or a nice f2 or 350  Roll over is that of any big SUV  Ford has taken great pains to limit roll over as much as possible without sacrificing too much clearance  My personal interaction with this truck is of testdriving br br  
Pos, My reason for considering the EXCURSION was its size primarily  The ones I had looked at seated at least eight  When I test drove it  the ride was smooth and controlled  I have had it now for about two weeks and it is the best vehicle I have ever owned  All the instruments are within reach and I am a very small female  The seats are adjustable and heated  The space is incredible  The kids love it  The leg room is ample enough for adults to sit VERY comfortably all the way to the back bench seat  I traded in a 1998 Toyota Forerunner  Limited  for it  That was a great car too  but it didn t ride half as smooth on the road as this vehicle  One thing to watch is how long it is on the nose and on the tail  It was a bear to park the first time  but I have the hang of it now anyone who has several people to drive about needs this vehicle  It is heads and shoulders above the Suburban  First of all  it is bigger  more beautiful  and a better bet as far as towing capacity  It can tow up to 10 000 pounds Great buy  I got mine a Limited with leather seats for around  37 000 br br  
Pos, I own the limited version of this vehicle and also have a large family  I ve had an Expedition which I was very happy with for the past two years but we are currently selling it  Unfortunately our family has outgrown it  One of the reasons for buying the Excursion is the extra room behind the 3rd seat which the Expedition didn t offer  There is plenty of room for strollers  suitcases  camping gear  etc Most the complaints about this vehicle is that it is too large and uses too much gas  People with large families really don t have many choices when it comes to a vehicle which is able to carry the entire load  I didn t want to buy two vehicle which together would use more gas than the Excursion alone  While I knew I needed a large vehicle common sense also tells me that the gas mileage would be poor  While many people think this is by far the largest vehicle  minus semi s  buses and RVs on the road I must disclose that this is not true  The Excursion is 226 7 quot  long  80 quot  wide and 79 5 quot  high and 7150 lbs  The Super Duty Crew Cab 350 Pickup is 257 6 quot  long  95 5 quot  wide  5604 lbs  and unknown height  That s a difference of almost 31 quot  in length and 15 5 quot  in width  The shorter truck version is 241 4 quot  long  The 150 Super Duty Crew Cab is 225 9 quot  long 79 8 quot  wide and 77 2 quot  high  This is almost the same size as the Excursion  The trucks and Excursion obtain about the same gas mileage 12 MPG give or take about 1 mile to the gallon although the Excursion Power Stroke engine is about 17 MPG  The Excursion obviously weights more but it also has to protect more passengers  These figures are based on 2000 and 2001 truck models All seats in the Excursion offer generous leg  head and elbow room  I have even sat in the 3rd row seat very comfortably  The seats are very comfortable for long trips I have the 7 3 L Power Stroke diesel engine which obtains about 17 MPG compared to the 12 MPG of the other version  Personally  other than the recent spike of gas prices which is already working its way back down  I have no complaints in the amount of gas I need to buy  The 17 MPG is very comparable to the many mini vans on the road Once you familiarize yourself with this vehicle  it s surprisingly maneuverable and easy to park  It drives and rides smoothly and handles corners with ease If you re in the market for an Expedition  take your time in test driving it and contemplate what you will use it for because it isn t for everyone but I am extremely happy with it     
Pos, There were really only two SUVs that I was considering  The Chevrolet Suburban and the Ford Excursion  After doing extensive research and test driving I realized that the Ford Excursion was in a class of its own  The Ford is safer and larger than the Suburban and was obviously designed with safety and capacity as a goal  I won t argue that the Suburban is a great 4x4 but if you test drive both  and can afford the gas for the Ford  I think you will also realize that the Ford is the better truck  I found myself stopped behind a Suburban at a traffic light when I was driving home from the dealer with my new Excursion and it was at that point that I realized how much larger the Ford is  I was blown away by the acceleration of the V 10 engine  it sure didn t seem like I was driving a 4 ton truck  This truck is meant for people who want safety  towing and cargo capacity and the great feeling of a luxury LARGE truck br br  
Pos, This vehicle may not be for all people but if you tow a trailer and have children this vehicle is for you  The ride is firm but not horrible  It is built on the F 250 chassis so don t expect a Cadillac ride  I opted for the diesel which gets me 13 to 14 mpg around town and over 18mpg on the hwy while not towing  The fit and finish are excellent  The interior is quite comfortable and the stereo system is very good  Space for carrying things is second to only a van  I really can not say much bad about this vehicle  I will say that unless you own one  keep your opinions to yourself people  This is not a site for do gooders or moral opinions  People want the hard facts  Consumer reports gave it a lousy report but I think when reporting on a vehicle like this you can not compare it to the BMW or LEXUS suvs  Sure  it takes longer to stop  it weighs 7200lbs  Consider that is nearly 80  heavier than those two car like suvs and its braking distance is not bad by far  It has 4 wheel disk brakes  load range D tires  a class4 hitch and will tow 10000lbs  The diesel has plenty of get up and go and should satisfy most people  It is a bit noisy compared to the gas models  
Pos, I have a 19 year old vehicle which needs to be retired  I looked for something to replace it with  At the time there was not much around which really qualified  And along came the Excursion  with a king size price tag to go with it But everything else filled the bill  Size  comfort  capability and everything else I could ask for  Fuel mileage is tolerable at about 18 20 mpg  imp  This is not much different than the 1998 explorer  17mpg on a good day  which we traded in for the Excursion  Ha Handling takes a bit to get used to  but once you get on to what to expect  its an absolute darling Parking is initially a real experience  It takes practice  before you go shopping or towing Its nice to have a large fuel tank so you don t have to keep looking for pit stops I checked out the cost of the recommended oil for the diesel and its not much more than what I had to pay before  The oil filter is a behemoth but still not extraordinarily expensive Ford provides lots of descriptive literature in the owners manual and also provides a manual for the 7 3L Power Stroke The back up beeper works as advertised  It starts beeping at about 5 something feet from an object  The sensors are susceptible to ice snow  and dirt so you have to keep them clean Cant find any squeaks  rattles or other annoying noises to complain about Lots of people seem to be complaining about roll in the corners but to them I say  slow down and take the corner intelligently according to what you are driving and you will find that there ain t no roll Speaking of roll  there is no binding on the discs so when you take your foot off the brake  the vehicle will roll very easily from a dead stop The Excursion is not for the faint of heart nor just for the rich and famous  Its a well built beast and will work as advertised and last a long long time  Fix or repair daily applies of course since any vehicle requires proper maintenance on a regular schedule  Treat it right and you can t loose on this one br br  
Pos, We just purchased our Excursion this past week  As a past owner of a F 150 Conversion Ford Van for over 10 years I have found that the Excursion is not much more than what I have been driving  We purchased a car also this past year to try and keep miles of Van  but I found myself going back to driving the van because I never felt safe in a car  My reason for the purchase of the Excursion are  being safe  towing power   we have a 27ft travel trailer  room for passengers  comfort  What I am saying to this as I read many opinions about how big and unsafe it was for the Excursion to be out on the road  might I add  that it is most of these small cars and trucks that are going over the speed limit and taking the chances  We  big car owners respect the roads and are more observant of our surroundings  I m sorry all you small car owners feel this way but keep your eyes on the road and off our big Trucks  I might I also add there have been F 150  F 250  F 350 on the road for years  the only different in this Truck is that it is covered  It handles like a charm  hugs the road great  and as for parking  I just park it like I did my Van  As for gas  well I did not buy it for that  I knew it was not much on gas  and we have not had it yet long enough to find out  We purchased the 6 8 V10 Limited  I have also read that people have strong feelings about the pollution problem with these big Trucks  might I add to this  when you are in the cities  look around at our transit system and count how many people might be riding at that time  I have seen at times when there are maybe 5 people on the buses  so what do we do about this problem  As for the tilting effect  No  but then I have driven a Big High Top Van  Maybe to those who are going from a car to this may feel this  But I can not say that  As for rattles  have not heard any  and the seats are great  So as my opinion goes  No this is not a Car truck  for everyone  Yes it is a great driving Truck  handles well  and I respect it  We did fill it up last night and our gas range was about 8 9  However that was the first fill up and we only drove it around town  We have been told once we get it broke in and out on highway we should do better  Again this is only my opinion  and I hope those of you who have just purchased one enjoy it as much as I do mine  Again to me it is no different than what I have always driven  Just everyone  be it small car owners or large car owners  keep your eyes on the road and what you are doing and not on what someone else is driving     
Pos, The new Ford Excursion is a huge truck with lots of room for both family and cargo  This truck has excellent power and still handles similar to an Expedition or an Explorer  It comes stock with a Triton V 10 engine which will not let you down  If need room and always had a van  but want a 4x4 than this is definitely the perfect vehicle  Don t worry about the comfort because this is extremely roomy  I use this truck at my work  I drive a Ford Explorer which is also and Eddie Bauer package  The two trucks are quite similar  Since the Explorer is one of the biggest sellers on the market I have a feeling that this truck will succeed because all it is  is a much larger Explorer or Expedition  One might say that Ford lacks creativity but if you drive this truck you will see the differences as well as the similarities  Talk about power even in 4x4 on some of the toughest trails and inclines this vehicle is not to heavy to get up a large hill  If you have a big family and a sense of adventure than this is most definitely the truck for you br br  
Pos, We owned a 1993 aerostar for over six years  We bought it new and sold it in 1999 with 88 000 miles on it  We bought it because we were planning yearly vacation educational trips with children and friends and thought it would be an excellent vehicle for this purpose as well as serving as our family work vehicle  The aerostar met and far exceeded out greatest expectations  In fact  the present owners are still using it for trips to a hospital in a nearby city every week  It now has 120 000 miles on it  There is nothing to hate about this vehicle  The gas mileage was wonderful  There were no major mechanical problems during its entire stay with us  We did conduct regular maintenance  tire replacements  and so forth  The seating was most comfortable and convenient  Even middle aged ladies from our church enjoyed riding with us to church conferences across the country  No one minded if they had to ride in the middle or back accommodations  In fact  the option of removing the back seat from time to time proved a helpful asset when carrying luggage  groceries  or other items  Our family mechanic often stated that maintenance access was convenient for working purposes  The smooth ride  easy driving  and comfort of the vehicle are exceptional  If you are looking for a reliable vehicle that shelters people and possessions from the weather  that is easy to maintain  and easy to drive  then this aerostar is what you need to buy br br  
Pos, We bought our used 1994 Econoline E150 Mark III Conversion van in 1998 from friends who didn t need the large van anymore  It had 49 000 miles on it and was in good shape inside  We have thoroughly enjoyed the van for the last two years  You can t beat it for long trips  You don t arrive at your destination feeling beat up  My kids enjoy watching movies or just being able to stretch out in all that space My concerns have only just now begun  Our ABS light on the dashboard started appearing randomly shortly after we purchased the van  When we checked with the Midas place locally about it  they said it was okay to drive  the regular brakes would always be available and they couldn t check it unless the light was actually on  Well it always goes off when the van is turned off and of course never comes on when we are close to a place that can check it  So that has been an ongoing concern  We still don t know what is wrong there Now recently on a trip  of course  the  quot OFF quot  button on the overdrive control started flashing indicating that something was going on with the transmission  Luckily we found an AAMCO place that was willing to take us and check it immediately  They explained that the transmission clutch was starting to slip and reset the button so that it wouldn t be flashing on our trip home  They told us that we could continue to drive it  don t push it by running on cruise control  and sometime the light would come on again  indicating problems again  but when that would be would be anybody s guess  Well of course  to fix it would entail big bucks The bottom line is that we are now babying the van  trying to decide if we want to fix all the problems or buy a new one  Yes we would buy a new one if we could afford it  They are wonderful vehicles and a joy to drive  Once you get used to driving the size  you ll never go back to small cars  The entertainment for the kids on long trips is priceless  No more  are we there yet  or how much longer  I d recommend them to anyone in a second  and I have Just as an update  It is now August 2000 and two things have changed  We did finally get to Midas and have them check out the brake light  They went over it thoroughly  and didn t charge us by the way  and couldn t find anything wrong with the brakes  The manager there told us that this is common in these vans and is probably an electrical short which they couldn t fix  Kudos to Midas Second  the transmission light came on again as we were going on vacation  Finally decided to suck it up and take it to a local nonchain transmission shop owned by an friend  He checked it over thoroughly  again for no charge  and said he wouldn t be driving the thing much longer if it was him  Right now  as we speak  it is in the garage having the transmission replaced  Looks like I ll be driving this one a few more years br br  
Pos, I 146ve never owned a pickup  and possibly never will  But I just had to drive the redesigned Ford F 150 as soon as it appeared on dealers  lots  Why  Ford s financial health has been shaky lately  and no product is more critical to this health than the company s full size pickup  the F 150  This truck  the best selling vehicle in the U S  for the last quarter century  contributes a major chunk of Ford s sales and profits  Consequently  as goes the new truck  so goes the company  Well aware of the stakes  Ford spared little when fully redesigning its large pickup for 2004   Partly as a result  the new F 150 is much more expensive to build than the old one  Given the importance of the new F 150 and the amount of effort Ford put into it  I felt compelled to check it out  Since I 146m not used to how large trucks drive  I also drove a Chevrolet and Dodge for comparison Note  This review is identical to that posted under the general F 150 heading  except that I ve added a section on reliability b Many  Many Choices  But which one  The new F 150 comes in five different models  base XL  work truck  low end sporty STX  midrange XLT  which will probably be most popular  high end sporty  off road ready FX4  and luxurious Lariat  Trim lines are just the beginning of the choices  Three bodies are available  regular cab  SuperCab  rear seat accessed by rear hinged half doors  and SuperCrew  larger rear seat accessed by four conventional doors  Going up one size cab will cost you about  2 500  Three bed lengths are available  5 5  6 5  and 8 feet  The 6 5 comes in both regular and Flareside styles  Going up a bed size costs  300  while the Flareside will set you back another  845 For 2004 two engines are available  both V8s  a largely carryover 231 horsepower 4 6 liter and an extensively upgraded 300 horsepower 5 4 liter  The latter  with three valves per cylinder and variable timing for higher efficiency and a broader torque curve  produces 365 foot pounds of torque at 3750 RPM  For 2005 there will be additional engines  includes a V6 and a supercharged V8  A manual transmission should also be available in later years  For now  either engine hooks up to a four speed automatic  Although this automatic is supposedly  147new 148 I would expect another before too long  as Dodge and  soon  Nissan offer five speed units Drivetrains include rear wheel drive  mechanical shift on the fly four wheel drive  and electronic shift on the fly four wheel drive  Unlike in Ford 146s large SUVs  automatically engaging all wheel drive is not available  As in other large pickups  many different axle ratios with and without limited slip are available to suit different needs  highway economy  towing  etc  Although the new truck is only available in light duty   147half ton 148 form  suitably configured it can carry up to 3 000 pounds or tow up to 9 500 The FX4 and Lariat come standard with a 40 20 40 bench like other F 150s  but as an option they offer buckets separated by a full center console that flows cleanly into the dash and mounts the shifter  a first in this class   Even the performance oriented Chevy Silverado SS has a column mounted shifter  This option is less practical  but to a car guy like myself it takes full size pickups in a whole new direction Although every possible combination of the above is not available  the range of variants is staggering and will only become more so in later years as additional powertrains are added Further complicating matters this year  the old F 150 will continue to be sold alongside the new one  Ford did this the last time the truck was redesigned  for the 1996 model year  At least this time around the aesthetic jump is not as drastic I 146m not going off road  so the faux wood trimmed  city slicker Lariat probably best fits how I would use such a vehicle  But I prefer the rugged yet sophisticated styling of the FX4  I also felt that the SuperCab with 6 5 foot standard bed represented the optimal combination of functionality and maneuverability   I suspect this configuration will be most popular with non commercial buyers  The SuperCrew is available only with the shortest bed  and the 8 foot bed is available only on the XL and XLT and makes for one ungainly 248 inch long truck when paired with the SuperCab  At 230 inches  the SuperCab with 6 5 bed is already a lot of vehicle  As luck would have it  the only F 150 I could find to drive was this configuration   Even this one might have been pre sold 151one salesman thought so  but the other was willfully ignorant of its status   Styling  The F 150 146s styling has been updated much like the Explorer 146s was for 2002 and the Expedition 146s was for 2003  Almost too prissy for a truck curves have given way to a more formal  more massive  broader shouldered look  Unlike the last time around  the new truck is not clearly a step ahead of the old one  it 146s just different  The new sheetmetal is much less striking than the   a href content 113078275716 Dodge Ram s a b   click for my review  and even less distinctive than the aero influenced old truck 146s  but to my eye it is the most refined and handsome among large pickups  It is hard to imagine it ever looking old or dated  already the fate of GM 146s current pickups  Like on Ford 146s heavy duty pickups the front side window dips down to lend the styling one brand specific detail and perhaps permit the large side mirrors to be mounted a bit lower  The largest wheels are 18s  and though no match for the cartoonish 20s available on the Ram they further enhance the truck 146s bold stance While the exterior styling is clearly evolutionary  the interior is revolutionary  I 146ve already mentioned the available full center console  In comparison  the center console in GM 146s trucks  clumsily integrated with the instrument panel  looks even more pathetic than it already did  The tall  cylindrical  chrome trimmed shift lever might be a bit too space age  and it could feel smoother  but it catches the eye and demonstrates the extent of Ford 146s desire to reinvent the pickup cabin  The click  square edged styling of the leather trimmed buckets looks very upscale  The pebbled texture of the FX4 146s black  147sport 148 leather further connotes this is one tough yet ritzy truck   Want leather in something other than black  Tan leather is available only in the Lariat  Although the XL and STX share a non tach instrument cluster  the other three trim lines have six gauge clusters that not only differ in graphics  cream faces in the Lariat  for example  but in the location of the gauges  Varying the latter can be costly  and I don 146t see the point  Some subtle differences in preferences might be involved  but I imagine any of the three gauge layouts would have been fine with pretty much everyone  So perhaps they tried too hard  and have added unnecessary cost as a result Aside from these interior features  what most impresses is the level of fit and finish in the interior  The materials might not be suitable for a Lexus  but they 146re nicer than any other Ford I 146ve been in  Fits and seams appear very precise  which is rarer than it should be in domestic vehicles  After test driving this truck and wondering why Ford doesn 146t outfit its cars this well I read a review  in  Automobile   that ventured the same question  Between the styling and the materials  the new F 150 146s interior shames those in other domestic pickups b Accommodations  The front buckets first impress with their size  They feel like thrones  Then there is the matter of design  The comparison between them and the front seats in the competition resembles that between modern furniture and a traditional American sofa  Okay  maybe not quite that large a difference  but it 146s getting there  These seats are considerably firmer than the pickup norm  such that you sit on them rather than in them  They possess side bolsters  but these are too widely spaced to serve any function for all but the widest people  I found these seats comfortable  but traditional pickup buyers might find them somehow foreign As expected in such a vehicle  visibility forward and to the sides is excellent  To the rear it 146s not so good owing to the tall  distant rear end  I would highly recommend the optional reverse sensing system  I don 146t see the point of such systems in most cars  but here I see the point  The truck I drove lacked this option  but based on similar systems in other vehicles I 146ve driven it should work well The driving position is the most carlike of the domestic trucks  The Chevrolet is similar  while the Dodge seat is mounted so high I found myself planting my left foot flat on the floor 151no need for a dead pedal  In the Ford you could almost be in a car  if one with large seats positioned well above the ground  In the Dodge you 146re clearly in a truck Given the truck 146s height off the ground  the optional tubular steps were a great help getting in and out  The Chevrolet and Dodge trucks I drove lacked such steps  though they are available either from the factory or aftermarket  and getting in and out was much harder  especially with the latter   The Chevrolet 146s seating position is the lowest of the three  Especially if you are short or have kids  you 146re going to want some form of step with any of these trucks When Chevrolet introduced fully redesigned pickups five years ago they eclipsed the competition in rear seat comfort  for the first time offering a rear seat in an extended cab with enough knee room and enough angle to the backrest to seat adults in adequate comfort  Well  the GM product is now the granddaddy of the bunch  When Dodge introduced its new truck last year  it offered an even roomier rear seat  Now it 146s Ford 146s turn to offer the best of the bunch  Unlike Ford and Chevrolet  Dodge offers only a single extended cab model with four conventional doors  Although the Ford SuperCab still uses rear hinged half doors  it contains a roomier  more comfortable rear seat than the Dodge  The SuperCrew rear seat offers another six inches of rear legroom  but unless the front seats will be most of the way back  i e  for tall people up front  the SuperCab 146s rear seat provides enough room for medium sized adults  and more than enough for children The SuperCab 146s rear doors might be rear hinged  but unlike before  and still in the GM products  they contain windows that fully retract rather than just pop out  One major innovation was missed  however  I 146ve been told that rear hinged doors can be difficult to use in parking lots  as you end up with insufficient room to move about alongside the vehicle when parked next to another vehicle with both doors open  Nissan 146s upcoming large pickup solves this problem with a rear hinged door that opens 180 degrees  The Ford 146s just opens about 90  Could be an argument for the SuperCrew 133 An optional power sliding rear window is another first with this truck  No power folding rear seat  yet  though As in all large pickups beginning with the 1993 Dodge Ram  cargo compartments within the cabin are generously sized  Ford offers an innovative track system that fits various accessories as well as storage on the ceiling  but this was replaced in the truck I drove by an optional sunroof  Yes  a sunroof in a large pickup  They must really be targeting people used to cars 133 Even regular cabs have small rear hinged doors to provide better access to an enlarged internal cargo area Unlike the Chevrolet but like the Dodge the SuperCab 146s folding rear seat is split 60 40  Unlike the Dodge  there are no nifty storage compartments beneath it  but this frees up a big more volume The new pickup beds are a couple of inches deeper than the norm  To my eye this significantly enhances their cargo volume  However  one review I 146ve read suggested this together with the Ford 146s height  GM products sit a bit lower  makes it hard to reach into the bed and grab stuff  Unfortunately  I did not check this out  but will the next time I have the chance  An innovative torsion bar makes the tailgate easier to open and close than other pickups b On the Road  The styling and interior comfort of the new F 150 suggest a better driving truck  Is this accurate The FX4 comes standard with the three valve  5 4 liter V8  In comparison  the GM 5 3 liter produces five fewer horsepower and 35 fewer foot pounds of torque  The latter seems an especially significant difference  The touted  147Hemi 148 5 7 liter in the Dodge kicks out 45 more horses  but only ten more units of torque 151so in the midrange the two engines aren 146t far apart  The Dodge also has another gear ratio to play with  How does all of this shake out  Well  even though I tested the GM engine in the Avalanche  which is heavier than the Silverado  it felt the perkiest of the three in normal despite having the weakest stats  Both the Ford and the Dodge have to be prodded more to get them to perk up  At full throttle the Dodge might well have the edge  but based on the seat of my pants the difference is too close to call  I suspect differences in mass counterbalance those in power  The truck I drove weighed about 5 700 pounds   Glass sunroofs  step bars  the FX4 146s standard skid plates  the stiffer longer frame 133such features can add serious mass  In comparison  a base GM 4WD extended cab truck weighs under 5000 pounds  though the 4WD Avalanche clocks in around 5 700  The Dodge falls between the two I also drove the Chevrolet Silverado in 345 horse SS form  It 146s quicker Bottom line  Even with the revised 5 4 and optional 3 73 axle the Ford is hardly quick  I especially expected more passing power on the highway  What the Ford V8 is is quieter and smoother than the others  The Chevrolet produces considerably more intake roar with little provocation  while the Dodge 146s Hemi produced so much mechanical noise at idle that I almost thought the salesman had grabbed the keys to a Cummins diesel by mistake   The Hemi engine will later be available in Chrysler 146s large cars  that should be interesting given its very trucky character EPA ratings are 14 18 with four wheel drive  15 19 with rear wheel drive  similar to GM 146s 15 18 and one mile per gallon better than Dodge 146s 13 17  However  word of mouth suggests that real world fuel economy is best with the GM trucks  People I know with GM trucks typically report fuel economy in the 14 15 range  those with Fords in the 11 12 range  or worse  I suspect the additional weight of the Ford trucks  which forces their engines to work harder  is to blame  Ford claims major frame and suspension improvements for better ride and handling  The frame is nine times stiffer than the old one  while the cabs are twice as stiff  The rear springs are wider  while the shocks are mounted outside the frame  The steering is rack and pinion  a first for four wheel drive trucks   The Dodge uses rack and pinion with the rear drive chassis only  But how does it all pan out In character the new F 150 resembles the current Expedition  body motions feel more precisely and tightly controlled than in the competition  and the steering is firmer and also more precise  Lean in turns feels more restrained than in the others  especially the non SS GM products   147Taut 148 comes to mind  That said  the GM products handle more responsively and intuitively  They feel somehow more natural despite their overboosted  less precise steering  The Ford in comparison feels technically superior but distant Another downside the large Fords share  a faintly jiggly ride over minor pavement imperfections   147Taut 148 has a price  Granted  I drove the F 150 in FX4 form  which includes a stiff  off road ready suspension  But the Expedition feels much the same  and the current Explorer does as well  so I suspect this jiggle is inherent in Ford 146s suspension philosophy  Throwing some mass in the back might help  I 146ve long noted in  Consumer Reports  that  unlike most cars  Ford 146s cars often ride better when heavily loaded  If this is true for the cars  it must also be true for the trucks  which are designed to carry loads  In short  Ford 146s suspension philosophy might include optimizing the ride with the vehicle heavily loaded Noise of all forms is unexpectedly low in the new Ford  This is the common finding from my test drive  refinement  refinement  refinement  Did the Blackwood come a generation too soon I did not evaluate off road performance  given that this was a test drive  I lack the skills at any rate  I would be surprised if the new FX4 did not perform well off the pavement  though  One nifty feature  the electronic throttle is more progressive in 4 low b Safety  Like the GM trucks but unlike the Dodge  four wheel anti lock brakes are standard  On the other hand  side airbags  of the curtain variety  are only available in the Dodge  Traction control and stability control are not yet available on any of these four wheel drive trucks b Reliability  First year designs from Detroit brands are often troublesome  Will the new F 150 prove unreliable  On the one hand  if Ford could get any product right straight out of the box it would be this one  as they no doubt threw scads of their top talent at this truck  The engines and transmissions are also largely carryover  with the exception of the heavioy revised 5 4 liter V8  eliminating a common source of problems   The V6 in my second year Ford Contour required replacement at 66 000 miles because of an issue known within Ford but not admitted to by Ford dealers  On the other  this was a very complex program  and recent first year Fords  Focus  Escape  have been especially troublesome  I guess it all comes down to whether you are a betting man  If the truck does prove troublesome  I hope Ford dealers know more about this product than the Contour I recently disposed of  Even in the Detroit area I experienced much difficulty finding a dealer with a skilled and personable service department  I once asked a dozen Ford owners if they knew of a good Ford service department  and they all said no b Pricing  As you might have noticed  I drove a truck with most of the available options  They add up  The sticker on my truck  which still lacked a few minor options  and the pricey Flareside bed  read  37 770  Go with the SuperCrew and check every box  and the sticker will easily top forty  Edmunds suggests dealers will discount the truck I drove to  35 000  Currently no rebate is available  though low interest financing is Since many features on this truck are not even available on the competition  to get a sense of relative pricing it is better to look at an SuperCab XLT 4WD with the 5 4 liter engine  automatic  electronic 4WD  limited slip differential  rear defroster  power driver 146s seat  alloy wheels  and towing package  I expect this will be a popular combination  This truck would list for  33 105  and  30 700 after the typical discount   Note  Doing without four wheel drive would cut the price by over  3 000 A similarly equipped Chevrolet Silverado LS extended cab with 5 4 liter V8 lists for  32 080 with a heavily discounted  147light duty power package 148  I suspect this package is intended to counteract Ford 146s new truck  After the typical discount and a  1 500 rebate  the cost drops to about  27 600  A similarly equipped   a href content 113078275716 Dodge Ram a b  1500 Quad Cab with 5 7 liter V8 lists for  34 500  The typical discount and a  1 000 rebate take this down to about  30 600  So about dead even with the Ford The Chevrolet is the oldest truck here  and GM has priced it to compensate  the other two are  3 000 more  quite a difference  I see lower transaction prices from Ford and Dodge in the future  but in the case of the former perhaps only after it stops selling the old F 150 in 2005  Until then  the old truck can be used to keep price sensitive buyers from defecting to GM i Update i  I ran the above numbers assuming that the Ford s electronic four wheel drive system  optional on XLT  standard on 4WD FX4 and Lariat  is a ful time system  as the salesman claimed as much  But I see no such claim in the brochure  and  Consumer Guide  states that Ford offers only a part time system in the F 150  If so  then I have overstated the price of the Chevrolet and Dodge by about  400  The new Ford just seems pricier and pricier b Last Words  The new Ford F 150 impresses with its style  fit and finish  and all around refinement  I cannot recall ever finding a standard full size pickup so appealing  The truck s major weakness is too much poundage even for its new  stronger engine  Overall  the new pickup shows what Ford can do when it pours talent and money into the development of a vehicle  But can the new F 150 recoup its large investment and relatively high manufacturing costs  Can it bring good times back to Dearborn  That remains to be seen  The Chevrolet and especially the Dodge seem very trucky after a drive in the Ford  But the new Ford is priced far above the Chevrolet  and I 146m unsure how many people will be willing to pay the premium  A few months will tell  
Pos, INTRO Trucks  you either love them or you hate them  Me  I love them  Trucks in England are extremely rare  if you did own one it would be almost impossible to afford to run one  I wanted a truck so bad  When i moved to Oklahoma  i could not believe the amount of people who owned trucks  The one way for me to fit in  For me to become Americanized would be to buy a truck  And i love the F 150 FROM DEALERSHIP TO DEALERSHIP With so many dealerships and so many different types of trucks out there  my wife and i set out early  I knew i wanted a ford  I m a ford man  Always have been always will be  you always know what you are going to get with fords  Reliable  dependable transportation at reasonable prices  I started out looking at used trucks  i found a 2000 XL model for  10 000 and was really tempted to buy it  but i wanted to look around at one more dealership  So we went to Hudiburg  There was a beautiful red pickup right by the entrance to the show room  The salesman told me it was a 2003  i told him i could not afford it  and then he told me the price   12 988  After i picked my jaw up off the floor and put my eyes back in their sockets i was ready to take the beast for a test drive  He told me that it was the special Oklahoma Texas Package that made it so cheap  It is just a basic F 150 XL but oh boy do i love it FIRST IMPRESSIONS If you have read any of my other reviews on automobiles you will know that i am quite particular on what i like  I like my vehicles to be curvy  I have no idea why  This was a big deciding factor in what truck i wanted to buy  The F 150 looks beautiful  Sleek curves and lots of chrome and a re designed grill for 2003  The XL comes with chrome wheels as standard and they look pretty sharp  The F 150 is very easy on the eye a pure joy to look at The Interior of the truck is basic but everything you need is there  The XL is the low end model of the F 150 so there are no extras  what you see is what you get  The dashboard is once again like the exterior very curvy and real appealing it is nice to look at and is not harsh on the eyes  The layout is simple and looks clean and tidy  On the XL there is no rev counter  just the Speedo  oil gauge temperature gauge and fuel gauge  The mileage counter is digital  which is pretty standard nowadays in most vehicles  The dials are big and are very easy to read and in classic ford style they light up green at night The stereo and the a c and heat controls are within good reach of the driver and they are very easy to operate though i think the stereo could be better  i also wish that ford would stop fitting double din stereos in their vehicles  That just adds extra cost when you want to replace the stereo  which i have just done  The A C and the heater work very very well  It gets cool very quickly in the truck  which is what you really need here in Oklahoma  and the truck gets nice and warm quickly too My truck comes with a bench seat  which is actually pretty comfortable  and gives a reasonable amount of support  It folds forward so you can put a few small items behind the seat  I have a complaint about the material used on the seats though  It really isn 146t very good  I would have thought that being a truck the fabric would have been a bit tougher but it is not  About 2 months after buying the truck the stitching begun undoing and holes started appearing  and that is just through normal use  so i have now brought seat covers to stop further damage to the fabric  The steering column is not adjustable and the bench seat only moves back and forward and the back really doesn t move very much so you are always sitting in an upright position ON THE OPEN ROAD The F 150 i have is the 4 2 v6  with standard transmission  The engine puts out 202BHP and is plenty powerful for everyday use  Correct me if i am wrong but i think the 4 2 V6 is only 20 BHP Less than the 4 6 V8  The Truck is quick  not lightning quick but there is ample power there  Over taking on the interstate is not a problem  nor is having little fun at the lights   The truck does about 19 MPG on the interstate and about 17 MPG around town  which is pretty good  It costs me about  25 00 to fill the tank from scratch  The Interior Noise is pretty high  but compared to earlier model F 150 s it has improved greatly  The truck handles pretty well and it comes with power steering as standard  which always makes life easier  Another thing that really surprises me with the truck is that there is very little roll when you turn into corners  More so than if you were in a car but still impressive  The ride quality is very good  You get the usual bouncy ride that you get from most trucks but overall the ride comfort is very good  My only other niggle is that the truck is rear wheel drive  I understand why that is but when there is nothing in the bed of the truck the back wheels tend to spin very easily so you have to take great car when driving this vehicle  the wheels spin if there is loose gravel on the road and it can be pretty bad when it has rained  so you just have to be that extra bit careful There is plenty of room in the bed of the truck for whatever you want to put in there and man does having a truck come in handy  We just moved into our first house and i do not know what we would have done without the truck  you can fit tons of things into the bed  it comes in very handy Overall this truck is great  I love it  For  12 988 i cannot complain to much  it is a basic model truck that will do you proud and will probably last you a life time  
Pos, On a tight budget after first getting married  my wife and I bought a brand new 1993 Ford Escort Wagon for  9 300  It came with A C  dual powered remote mirrors  manual transmission  roof rack and a cassette stereo Seven years and 93 000 miles later the car is still running great  It hasn t been  quot perfect quot  but what has gone wrong have been minor annoyances  see list at bottom of this epinion The car has lots of room for cargo  and the roll over cargo cover is great when you want to shade frozen groceries or just keep a passer by from looking into your car  The 60 40 split folding seats are life savers when taking trips to home depot Controls throughout the car are too small  Small radio buttons  with completely un intuitive radio clock settings  small fuel filler release lever  small climate control levers  Admittedly it is a small car  but I ve driven a Saturn and the controls were far larger One big problem were the original tires  After 30 000 miles the car started handling very poorly and I noticed the tires were wearing in an odd fashion  A mechanic thought the suspension was shot based on the wear of the tires  but a friend of ours said a good pair of tires fixed her problem  Sure enough  a pair of Goodyear Weatherhandlers and 60 000  miles later we have not had a recurrence of the problem The wipers have only one intermittent setting  It lasts for about five seconds between wipes and it is a feature seldom used unless the rain is coming down at just the right rate  An annoying engineering problem is the windshield wipers are different sizes  After sizing up just one of the wipers I went to the store and bought a package of wipers  they always come in two s  I had to go back to the store after realizing the second wiper was a different size  but at least the next time I need wipers I ll have a complete set Gas mileage has been excellent  averaging about 28 mpg  The gas tank is only 12 gallons  so expect about 300 miles between fill ups Two child seats fit in the back seat  but only the smallest of children could fit between the two child seats  essentially making this a four seater until the children get bigger Ride comfort is acceptable for short trips and bearable for long trips  Road noise is pervasive at high speeds and handling is fair  The interior is very spartan in appearance and the vinyl and plastic look cheap  Compared to other cars in its class   Saturn  Civic  Cavalier  Corolla  it s on par To conclude this is not the most comfortable car  heads will not turn when you drive it  it s had some problems  But  and this is a big but  it s never broken down  it holds lots of cargo  only cost  9 300 new  and has a current Kelley Blue Book trade in value of  2 400   what s not to love about this car What s gone wrong   related   cost 1 Plastic cap holder on windshield washer fluid broke  never fixed 2 Plastic driver seat belt holder broke  15 part  did work myself 3 Rubber insulator around rear passenger door  6 part  did work myself 4 Broken rear suspension spring  400   including labor br br  
Pos, I had a 1993 Escort Wagon  I owned this vehicle longer than any other vehicle before or since  I really liked this car  Believe it or not I was one of those people who swore that I would never own a station wagon  Then my first child came and the extra room just made sense  We could throw the stroller  diaper bag  portable playpen crib all in the back of the Escort for a trip to Grandma s house  This car was really nice to drive  The seats are comfortable  It handles well on the road  even in the snow  This car would normally be fairly inexpensive  It that were true in my case I would probably still have this car  Unfortunately I made some bad choices and ended up with a lot of negative equity  This car ended up with the brunt of the inequity and an extremely high interest rate to go with it  So as much as I loved this car  I hated the price I had to pay for it  I was lucky enough to find a car dealership that would help me rectify this situation and gave me a great deal on my last 2 vehicles   if you live in Western Washington check out Automotive Alternatives in Bremerton  they were great  I really liked this car  I can t think of anything bad about it  No costly repairs  no breakdowns  just routine service br br  
Pos, Ok  it s not new anymore  The brake pedal looks worn and the new car smell is long gone  but I still love my Ford Escort Wagon  I bought my Ford wagon brand new in 1993  It s been afforded all the basic upkeep required  i e  regular oil changes  the ocassional trip to the car wash  etc  Now 105 000 miles later  I still can t bring myself to part with it  Even today it is my main source of transportation Oh  I haven t babied it any  This tough little tiger has seen seven unfriendly Montana winters and faithfully carried me over small  back country  wooded  one lane  gravel roads  It almost single handedly served as a moving van for my family several times and has served to push another of our lesser vehicles to a safe parking place when the other vehicle failed me  I am absolutely amazed at how My Ford Escort Wagon performs for me My fuel economy is favorable and manuerablity is faithful  I m not ready to go shopping for a new vehicle just yet  but one day when my little station wagon has reached the limits of it s usefulness  there is no question that I ll be back on the Ford lot  looking to bring home the next generation br br  
Pos, My wife and I currently own a 1993 Ford Escort LX E 4 door hatchback and never cease to be amazed by its economic upkeep  reliability  and capabilities We live in South Texas and use the car for local travel only   the best use of its service  We usually travel limited access highways and the Escort keeps up with the BMWs  Mercedes  and 18 wheelers reasonably well  although the power we have is  obviously lower  Our  quot little car quot  does 55 to 65 MPH without breathing too heavily  And  best yet  unlike these other vehicles  the Escort only requires an oil change  cost about  20  about every 3500 miles and a major service  costing about  600  every 25 000 miles  How do you like that BMW and Mercedes fans My wife is a real do it yourselfer who likes wood working  By using the hatch back feature  we have been able to haul  at different times  of course  a table saw  a treadmill walking machine  a router and router table  several sheets of plywood and over 10 2x4s The October 1999 NADA values on this car make it a great buy if you can find one in good condition  Trade in  3 175  Loan  2 875  Retail  4425  A really good price on this vehicle in good  not perfect  condition would be about  3 000 and a good price would be about  3 500  Anything above Retail is a rip off br br  
Pos, A few months ago my wife and I went car shopping  We went looking for a Tracker  A really good car when we have a car seat  and a 2 year old LOL  Well that day we test drove about 10 cars  Just as we thought our search was going no where I saw the Escort sitting right by the Tracker we tried 1st  We test drove the car and loved the way it drove  A lot better car for a growing family than a Tracker  I have to say I never saw me owning a station wagon  but I will not trade it in now  Being an Escort the gas mileage is great  We get about 30 mile to the gallon and with todays prices you can not beat that The one thing I worried about was the leg room  Being 6 5 quot  it is hard to find a good car with leg room  To my surprise the wagon is very roomy  Well as long as no one has to sit behind me  So I have to say I really do like my new car  even though it is an 1993  Does this mean I am getting old  LOL   
Pos, First off  let me state that I do not own this 1995 Ford F150 4wd XLT Supercab Pickup that I am about to review  My best friend owns this truck  I borrowed it from him recently on a 320 mile round trip to pick up an item I bought out of state  Some of you are probably asking yourselves  how can he write up a review on a vehicle that he doesn t even own  Let me add though  that my job provides me the opportunity to drive A LOT of different makes of light duty trucks  1 2 ton  3 4 ton  and 1 tons  These trucks are work trucks  I do not baby them  I use them  With that said  here is my opinion of the 1995 Ford F150 This particular Ford is a teal colored  yuck  short box with 73 000 miles on the odometer  It is fitted with the optional 5 8 liter  351 c u  V8  mated to an automatic overdrive transmission  This engine provided very adequate power  I set the cruise at 75 mph and the truck held it  even going up steep inclines that brought tractor trailers and vw buses to a crawl  The automatic transmission seemed to be very smooth and precise during shifting  With the cruise control set at 75 mph  the tach read a very respectable 2200 rpm  I was very impressed with this since engine life would probably be extended with such a low engine rpm  I have no complaints whatsoever with the engine and tranny in this Ford  I would recommend this engine over the smaller 5 0 liter  302 c u  V8  especially if you plan on pulling a trailer of any size  Also  I checked the mileage on my 320 mile journey  all interstate driving  I got 15 6 mpg  I would say this is par with other makes of 1 2 tons in the 1995 model year  Not as good as our 97 chevy 1 2 ton 4X4  350 c u  I use at work  I can squeeze 20 mpg out of her  This Ford contained two gas tanks to minimize gas station stops  A nice plus I thought the ride quality of this 1 2 ton Ford was quite harsh compared to other makes of 1 2 ton trucks I have driven  I could feel every crack and bump I traversed on the interstate  I could even feel the vibrations through the steering wheel  I couldn t blame the poor ride on bad shocks  since I know my buddy just replaced the shocks  Maybe the poor ride quality could be contributed partially to the type of tires he is running  I don t know  Secondly  I thought there was more road noise entering the cab then was acceptable  Thirdly  I found this truck  quot wanders quot  When this truck would wander into a rut on the interstate  it would pull suddenly to one side than the other  If one wasn t holding onto the steering wheel with both hands it could take you by surprise  I don t know what caused this  tires suspension  This model was equipped with a 60 40 split seat in front  I found the seats to be fairly comfortable  The driver was treated to a power lumbar support  In the center of the seat there was a fold down console  This was very nice  It contained 2 cup holders able to accommodate my rather large coffee mug  The console also had compartments inside for currency  notebooks  cell phones  etc  I am 6 2 quot  and found legroom to be acceptable  Rear passenger legroom is limited though  as is with any extended cab pickup  The small fold down back seat is designed for small children  not adults I did not care for the stock sound system  It was an AM FM stereo cassette w  four speakers  Sound quality was very poor and could not drown out the excessive road noise that this Ford exhibited  The buttons were extremely small making it very easy to hit the wrong button  Also  the stereo was placed in a very awkward position in the dash  I had to reach very far toward the center of dash to turn channels  This could prove to be very hazardous when driving  First thing I would do if this was my vehicle is upgrade the stereo with an after market system  I had the opportunity to use both the air conditioning and the heater on my short 1 2 day trip  gotta love Wyoming  I found both worked fantastic  No complaints in this department This truck was equipped with the power window door package  I found the power windows locks to be very efficient  The windows rolled up and down very fast  I own a 1987 K5 Blazer and my power windows are pathetically slow  So  this was a welcome change In terms of safety features  this truck contained rear anti lock brakes  don t quite understand the reasoning here  and a driver side airbag  A passenger side airbag was non existent  In terms of reliability of this truck  my friend has had darn good luck thus far  Like I mentioned above  the truck now has 73 000 miles on the clock  He has had some problems with keeping the truck aligned  might be linked to the  quot wandering quot  problem  and front wheel bearings going out  I believe that is the only problems he has had in the four years he has owned the truck  I personally like the styling of this 95 F150 better than the new styling of the Ford F150 s  But  if it was my choice I would choose the 95 Chevy 1 2 ton over this Ford     
Pos, I chose this vehicle for several reasons  mainly the ability to comfortably carry a family of four  haul lots of stuff and tow  It is used to carry construction supplies and debris  take the family and accompanying baggage toys camping or traveling and tow various things  boats  trailers  etc  It does all of these things very well I bought the Eddie Bauer version  2wd  5L  auto trans  towing package  My commute is comfortable  Even during long drives to New England all the family has adequate room  The size of the truck gives a good ride The truck weighs about 4500  with fuel driver  I ve crossed the scales at the landfill weighing 6800  On one occasion  pulling a trailer load of asphalt to be recycled  the combined weight was over 14 000  Okay maybe I ve overloaded once in awhile The truck now has 109 000 miles on it  Oil is changed regularly  tires rotated every 5 10 000k miles  I ve had NO PROBLEMS with it  The original tires weren t replaced until 63 000 miles  Still the original brakes with   20  wear left  good for another 15 000 miles or so  Fuel mileage is around 15mpg  which I consider reasonable for the way I drive  Two fuel tanks are a nice thing to have If this truck ever becomes a repair problem  175 200k miles  I will definitely purchase another Ford  Probably a bigger one If you want a vehicle that does many things well and reliably  this is it If you want something to zip around the city in  you may consider something else  Although there is the intimidation factor     
Pos, I bought a new Ford due to the history I have with the company  I have owned 3 Ford pickups and all have lasted past 300 000 miles  with understandable maintenance I recommend this pickup for everyone who truly needs a pickup  In the first 4 months of work  this pickup has truly proven it s self  In my line of work  I go places and sometimes carry more weight than most people would even try  Believe me or not I feel this pickup could go anywhere a army jeep can  strait from the factory  The gas mileage is decent  18 20 with the 298 v 8  better than I expected  and that does not seem to change much when hauling heavy loads  5000lbs  The engine performance is ok  given it is such a small motor  I would love to have the old 460 v 8 in every pickup ever built  The ground clearance is larger than in pervious models  This pickup also has several in cab dodads that I like  Such as more comfortable seats  additional compartments  outdoor temperature indicator  and easy adjustments to it all It was difficult to find a pickup with all of my specifications that I needed and had to special order this one  I do recommend the following  hand crank windows for longevity of use  5 speed manual trans  for better mpg  less engine strain in mud and towing  and emergency push starting I do not like the new body style  although it is growing on me  The lack of front fenders with this body style allows a steady rain of mud  amp  gunk to fall on the overly large front windshield when 4 wheel drive is needed  I also do not like the car like interior set up  Although the cab is roomy  this set up wastes space and is hard to clean  Another downside of this pickup is that  unless you are a mechanic  you can not fix any major problems that may arise yourself  Just open the hood for yourself br br  
Pos, This review is written in memory of our late friend and fellow Epinionater  Mike Lambert  Roadiem Okay  let me be straight up front about this  Yes I am Australian  and no  the cars driven in the USA are not the same as here in Australia But there are strong similarities  The main Australian designed and built cars are little different from those used in the USA  So  how do I know Well  about 18 months ago I had to spend a week in the U S  and I sought to rent as similar a vehicle as possible to that that I drive and own here in Australia  The perfect vehicle for the role was the Ford Crown Victoria  even though the name conjures up the Queen  yuk  or a famous Australian beer  Since I drove one 1 800 miles around the U S  East Coast  without hitting one kangaroo  I feel qualified to report on it s virtues  And  try as I did  I found it impossible not to make some comparisons with Aussi cars   well sufferin snakes  I tried Apart from getting in on the right hand side incessantly  I found this vehicle to be near identical to my Aussi Ford Futura  That brings me to the only real fault in this car  and all USA cars   that being there is no warning to get in the left hand side if you want to drive it   its so damn embarrassing  jumping in the right side for a quick take off with nothing there Now seriously  to me and I suspect most people  a car is either working or its broken  so you won t be bored here with a whole lot of mechanical jargon However  I do know enough to realize the Crown does follow the near universal basics of medium and big cars  That is rear wheel drive and a penchant for effortless highway cruising while still being quite maneuverable enough for the rigors of big city traffic For the average motorist its obvious that these basics are still the preferred vehicle type  despite the plethora of mostly Japanese and Korean buzz boxes on offer in both countries Perhaps this is because both Australia and the USA are relatively large with long distance driving common  Things have changed a bit though  with US cars no longer having Football Field size trunks and engine bays big enough for a spare engine  resulting in much more compact designs compared to those of say twenty years ago Fuel consumption is no doubt the major reason  Here  by US standards  the Crown does quite well but there is substantial room for improvement since equal Australian cars do about twenty percent better  Perhaps the slightly cheaper fuel  due to differing Taxation  makes the difference While the Crown Victoria I rented drove extremely well  I was surprised to learn it still had the old solid axle type rear suspension instead of the newer Independent Rear Suspension or IRS  However  the two most important safety features  being ABS and Power Torque Control were standard  as would be expected  The debatable air bags that have swept the world are of course standard   They ll have the damn things on pushbikes next I noticed Crown Victoria s everywhere  so they must be high in the sales stakes  and surely that alone speaks for itself  I understand they are even the vehicle of choice of many if not most Government Agencies  including the Police This too speaks volumes for its usability and quality So thats what an Alien thinks of the Crown Victoria   in a nutshell this vehicle would hold its head high in any company as a practical  well priced family car with outstanding touring capabilities mixed with good city driving attributes I found it both easy and enjoyable to drive  the ultimate test of any vehicle  and I have no doubt it would be at the top of my list if I was a USA Citizen B The proceeds of this write off go to Mikes wife  in his memory  May he rest in peace B B This review is a joint effort between SMITHSWOODSIDE and LadyCynic whose personal generosity in this regard makes me cringe in disbelief   please also visit LadyCynic s site   Please read the other write off entrants listed below bjcuevas  napthalia  seether166  sherrylee  mattjoe  viper1963  gollygumdrops  noniaBidnis nightshade 01  obnox  Hawkseafan  Yyvonne diverpam  T Hall  mtuairau  jennifa  PPerky1954 hnnygrlca  rcknron3  MiDoyle  charlesnep  LatteChick  garfield12  bgoodday  chrisceb  alwaysstubborn nwinston  hirohito99  sweetcece  theworm ginahill  jpmcgurk  tiffer0220  juliette  elorraine  imames  pipet  sparkospunky  disartain  Linda527 Lisa J  lgcurcio yahoo  kristinafh  tgreenway  pambo  friskycelery  tjarnold  iculooking  todd  teddiec Darby Walters wolfman309  emeleel  joubert  technologyrep gamblinfamily 
Pos, This was one of the best cars I have ever owned The gas milage isnt too bad  I feel very secure driving this car I feel like I could pickup and go to Florida if I felt like it  I would highly recomend this car to anyone  I know that alot of people say it s huge but when you are behind the wheel it dosen t feel that big  So if you are looking for a good reliable and inexpensive used car and size doesnt matter try it out I thin you ll like it Also if you can find one with a premium sound system you certainly will not be disapointed br br  
Pos, In normal everyday life  I drive a Volvo S70  While working  I drive my Crown Victoria  This is a very nice car and I have had it since new  It is very comfortable  and I love the color it s Dark Green a k a   quot Willow quot  I was given this car for work as my Buick Park Avenue Ultra was totalled  I liked the Park Avenue because the dashboard doubled as a M amp M dispenser on long trips  The Crown Vic is great for prolonged surveillance operations The gas mileage is poor and the power is lackluster  however  I convinced my employer to designate funds to make a couple of changes  A 2 chamber flowmaster dual exhaust was installed  very quiet  underdrive pulleys  hypertech chip and a K amp N Air Filter  These have made a remarkable improvement and has deleted the 110 MPH engine cutoff  I got the 1995 model  which has the updated transmission and new interior  that like of a 2000 model  Very good ergonomics There were a few problems with the car that are typical with any 92  Crown Vic  The tranny needed to be tuned up at 60K Miles  100  at 65K  the  quot Check Engine quot  light illuminated  which 99  of the time indicates that your EGR passage in the intake manifold is carboned up  125  and at the same time  the horn button discentigrated  50  New tires at 70K and Front brakes at 85K  All prices were at the Dealership out of warranty  parts  amp  labor  No problems during warranty This vehicle is nearing 92 000 miles and will be decomissioned at 100K  I hope to god that I will get another one Who should buy this  If you have a big family  I have had 11 people in this car once  live in your car  or travel a lot for work this is the car  Amazingly  it is very easy to park  it has been shot at three times and all three bullets missed so  it is not as big as it looks  If you love rear drive performance at a good price  look no further  My next car  2001 Crown Victoria br br  
Pos, Lets put it this way my grand mother drives this car  It is rahter big and some what comfortable in the interior  But it has horrible gas mileage and is quite ugly  If your are under 60 years of age and want to hold up any kind of an image this car might not be a good idea  It handles turns pretty well but the acceleration isn t that great and it is a real pain to park because it is so wide and long  However it is dependable  so if that is what you are looking for this is a good car br br  
Pos, The birth of our third child obliged us to sell our Mustang 5 liter in 1992 and buy a new Crown Vic after test driving every full size car on the market  The car just turned 142 000 miles  and it still seems brand new  The car is boilerplate reliable  The biggest repair has been a power window motor replacement  The car s only weak point is its oil consumption  about 1 quart per 250 miles  For its size  the Vic handles well  has plenty of power  is comfortable and quiet  The trunk is huge  I keep a notebook in the car  and it shows that we get 27 mpg on the highway  year in  amp  year out  Because we recently adopted two more kids  we bought a new Chevy Venture minivan  But my wife continues to use the Vic as regular transportation to work  shopping etc  We plan to keep the Vic as long as it makes economic sense to do so  and as long as it remains such a pleasure to drive  If all goes well  when our 12 year old turns 16 he can drive it  and take himself  amp  the other 3 to school  The Crown Vic is a keeper I sold this car May 17  2000  we weren t using it enough to justify keeping it  The book value was about  1600  but because it still drove so well and looked so new  I sold it for  3000 to the first person who came to see it  He thought the car was a bargain at that price     
Pos, I have wanted this car since they changed the body style all those years ago  I couldn t afford it the last time I bought a new car  but this year I could I m not a mechanic  I m not a car buff  I don t choose a car because of the engine  I m a teacher  I want a car that looks good  rides well  and is dependable  I chose the Crown Victoria  and it has been all of those  It also has a trunk that holds all of my sister in law s luggage with room for that of her husband and son  too  an amazing feat all by itself I have owned the car for 5 months  and have had no mechanical problems with it  It gets good gas mileage for a big  should I say huge  car  I live in Ohio  where winters are sometimes severe  I needed the traction control only a couple of times during the winter  always to climb a steep driveway  The traction control gives back what rear wheel drive takes away  The anti lock brakes have also kicked in a couple of times  The first time it startled me felt like I hit something on the road The car is very comfortable  My son and I agree that we could  go camping  in this car no tent required  The front split bench seat is pretty comfortable to  make out  in too  Take my word for it or try it yourself  grin However  the car is not perfect  The problems are in the fit and finish  There is a wind sound from the front passenger door  the right windshield wiper is never quite hidden  there is a whistle from the driver door  there are several imperfections in the paint  in one place the edge of the windshield shows instead of being protected by the molding  in several places tolerances are unacceptable  None of these things affect performance  but they are annoying  
Pos, SuperCab  Super Ranger THE FORD RANGER SuperCab  2003 GENERAL DESCRIPTION The Ford Ranger pick up is manufactured at the Ford factory in Edison  New Jersey  It is one of the most popular pick up in its category  It comes in a large variety of models and it is the least expensive of all the other pick ups amongst the competitors within the same category Ford offers their customers a choice of three engines  an economical 4 cylinder  a 3 liters V6 and a more powerful 4 liters V6  As for transmissions again Ford 146s will give you three options  a manual 5 speeds  an automatic for the 3L and a different automatic for the 4L engine THE INSIDE   OUTSIDE The interior The interior of the Ranger I drove was well finished and the materials seemed to be of good quality  There were no fancy rug on the floor  an example is that the flooring was made of an easy to clean and maintain rubber mat  The controls are easy to access and there is a complete set of gauges that are also easy to read  One thing I noticed about the gauges is their simplicity  By this I mean that if a person while driving surpasses the normal zones on a gauge there is no red zone on that gauge to indicate that the driver is in a dangerous situation The cabin was tight and I did feel that the interior was closing on me  there seem to be very little elbowroom  maybe I would have felt differently if I had driven the standard model The exterior The paint job on the truck was excellent and the panels seemed to fit tightly  It was equipped with a plastic fuel tank  which will prevent rust  but the inside of the rear box and the fenders seemed to have very little protection against bumps and scratches  It would be a good idea to have a liner install when purchasing a new Ford ranger pickup I really liked the way the exterior looked  every thing seems to be in the right proportions and well built THE ROAD TEST The model I drove was the Ford Ranger SuperCab  it was equipped with a V6 3L motor and an automatic transmission I found that there was a lot more noise than expected for a new truck  but after all it is a truck and because of the stiff rear suspension I felt the drive to be a bit bumpy  Probably it would offer a smother ride once there is a load in the rear box Breaking seemed satisfactory on a dry pavement but harder to control on a wet pavement TECHNICAL INFORMATION The truck I drove was as follows Engine  V6  3L Transmission  Automatic Drive  4 wheel drive Brakes  Front discs  rear drum  Anti lock system on the rear wheels Tires  P225 70R15 Truck weight  3 220 lbs Cargo weight capacity  1 250 lbs Towing capacity  4 000 lbs PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I feel this is a better than average pickup truck  I felt a little cramped in the driver seat and the ride was a little rough  I think that although this truck looks good it is truly a work truck I would not drive this vehicle on a long trip and I believe it is also limited for off roaming  but if someone needs a truck to transport tools and equipment to a working place this is the one of choice  
Pos, As the proud owner of my fourth Ford Explorer  I can honestly say the  2002 Explorer  is absolutely the best model yet  Ford proudly touts the 2002 as being all new  In fact  there are significant differences in the 2002 that made my 2000 model seem practically obsolete   New Body Style  The most noticeable difference is the new body style  It s quite a bit larger than previous model  with several enhancements The wheelbase is 2 inches long and almost 2 1 2 inches wider  With a more rigid suspension and better insulation  it also provides a noticeably quieter ride The independent rear wheel suspension really helps provide a smoother  more comfortable ride And  yes  it looks different  It s definitely bigger and the door handles are completely different  The rear window door has been changed  it definitely looks different than previous models   There s a practical reason for this that makes it easier to pop open the window and have almost full access to the cargo area B More Room  Yes  there really is more room inside the 2002 Explorer  I can easily tell the difference in how much room there is between the front bucket seats  This allows a  wider console  that easily provides two cups holders  a handy storage tray and a roomy storage compartment with latched top  There is also an outlet for charging my cell phone in the top of the console  This console is very convenient and ergonomically arranged There is a tissue holder inside the top of the console  I like this better than the previous models where the tissue was accessible from the outside of the console  There was always a ton of tissue fuzz to deal with The hard part about this is finding the travel size Kleenex boxes that fit here  Target has been my best source to find these Junior size boxes My husband loves the  extra head room  it provides  He is very tall and often found his head bumping the top of our 2000 Explorer  He has head room to spare in the 2002 model We purchased the optional  3rd row fold down seat   so eight people can comfortably ride inside  The second row seat folds down in three pieces  giving you six different configurations to aid in hauling cargo B Lots of Extras   The  CD player  holds 6 CDs and is located in the dash  The dash itself seems lower and wider and it s easier to see out     Dual climate control  allows the driver and front passenger to choose their own temperature settings  You can also set it to display the  outside air temperature   There are  redundant controls  on the steering wheel for the sound system and climate control  And of course  there is also cruise control  The  tilt steering wheel  is also height adjustable    The  electronic monitoring display  tells you just about everything you need to know about your car  miles to empty  miles per gallon  fuel level  oil level  wiper fluid level    The   Home Link b  option lets you pre program up to three codes  No more worrying about keeping up with a garage door or gate opener  I did notice you have to hold down the button a little longer than expected to get it to open the garage door  The  electric memory driver seat  allows both my husband and I to set the seat positions we prefer  then when we open the doors with our controller everything is set for us   It s so nice not to constantly readjust the settings between drivers   Heated rear view mirrors  come on automatically when you turn on the rear defroster  The front  seats are electric and adjustable  in a variety of ways  And  yes  they re also  heated   I never thought I would enjoy a  bun warmer  but it will be nice in the dead of winter when those leather seats get cold from being in the parking lot all day at work B And let s not forget the middle seat b  There are  air vents  and  separate temperature controls   as well  Even with two baby seats  there is still  plenty of room  for an adult to ride in comfort There are also  additional air vents  in the very back for the comfort of any passengers who might be riding in the third row seat B Easier trunk access  is provided by allowing the glass to open lower  making it easy to get groceries or suitcases in and out  The rear seat folds down almost completely flat  allowing  44 5 cu  ft  of storage space  Even the fuel tank is larger  holding 22 5 gallons of gasoline   Improved Performance  We purchased the optional  4 6L Triton V 8 engine   With 239 hp and 282 lb ft of torque  I ve had to be careful not to drive too fast   No  I do  not  have a lead foot i It really offers a  smoother  quieter ride  and handles very well  I just thought my previous Explorer drove like a car  This baby is very responsive and handles like a luxury automobile B Eddie Bauer Version vs  Limited  My 2000 Explorer was a Limited and we had planned to purchase a 2002 Limited  but they were in short supply  After looking closely and comparing features  the primary difference in the two was that the Limited offered certain colors that the Eddie Bauer did not  The Limited also lets you have monotone leather seats instead of the two tone Bauer leather seats All the other luxury extras  especially Home Link  are now included in the Eddie Bauer  I don t feel that I am missing anything from the luxury or the extras that I had in my previous Limited B We Love It  My husband and I have owned this car for three months now and we love it  It s extremely comfortable and it is a great looking vehicle It s averaging about 16 MPG in the city so far and we got it up to 21 on the highway  It s still breaking in and the mileage seems to be steadily improving We recently took a day trip in which we spent about six hours in this vehicle  We kept commenting how much we enjoyed the extra room and the smoother ride  My husband definitely enjoyed the extra head room We have the  Eddie Bauer  model with leather two tone seats  I wasn t too crazy about the two tone look at first  but I m liking it better all the time  I ve gotten several compliments on the interior  so that doesn t hurt either B Ford Provided Extras  Ford offered several incentives to buy    750  owner loyalty rebate   0  financing  for 36 months   Look  Ma  no finance charges i  A nice  tote bag  was given to us just for taking a test drive  We received a  tailgate party kit  for purchasing   this included a canopy  grill  and cooking utensils   We received our gifts last week after mailing in the postage paid cards Ford provided  Later we received a  75 gift certificate from Eddie Bauer  nice for Christmas shopping B Highly Recommended  I can t think of a better time to buy than now   great interest rates  extra incentives  and a really comfortable  good looking SUV  I really love this great Explorer  
Pos, I recently traded an amazing 230 000 mile Honda Accord for a brand new Explorer  The main reason being that I need more space  Space is what you get with the Explorer  The 3rd row option opens up this vehicle to a much larger market  Most SUVs seat 5 people the extra seat boosts that number to 7  The Durango and the Tahoe went under close scrutiny before I decided on the Ford This redesigned truck is great  There is new independent rear suspension  a new shock strut system  a new exhaust fuel tank layout  and a new footprint  This Explorer is a bit longer  a bit wider  and even has a bit more ground clearance all while being a little bit shorter  This SUV feels solid and comfortable while driving  There are several small details that add to this truck as well  The running boards and doors are designed to keep dirt off of the lower door seal keeping you and your kids clean while entering and exiting  The rear window s bottom seal dips down farther than before making it lower and thus easier to load and unload without opening the door  Automatic headlamps are nice and the doorlock switch mounted near the back door is handy  I have been extremely impressed with my new vehicle  It was a big step to move from a 2 door Honda to an American SUV  I have not been disappointed yet  
Pos, I recently had the opportunity to purchase a 1992 Ford Explorer 2 Door as my main vehicle  I have since driven it for 12 000 miles  changed the oil three times  and really have not had any problems with it  The vehicle has a little over 131 000 miles on it  and I am still getting the rated 23 highway   18 city mileage  and sometimes better  but never worse My Explorer is a 5 speed  with is a very dependable piece of equipment  Coupled to the 4 0L V 6  it has enough power to do what I want to do with it  It has the room a college student needs to move in and out every year  and haul people during the year  It is economical enough to be a daily driver  Dependable enough that it really has not seen the shop under my possesion  and small enough that parking it is not compared to parking the more mammoth of SUVs The only time it has seens the shop is when I had to have a synchronizer  1st   2nd shift  replaced  Point of note  dont believe your friend when he says he  thinks  he knows how to drive stick  My Explorer does not have 4wd  but that has not stopped me from taking it offroad  Coupled with my Firestone Wilderness ATX 235s  I have taken mud  sand  and water  within reason  of course The interior on mine is vinyl  but the seats are very comfortable  The front seats are a high backed bucket  which makes long trips easier on your neck I have been pleasantly suprised by my Explorer  and from how it is fairing  I will have it for a good time to come  
Pos, I leased a  99 Ford Explorer Sport  2WD  2 years ago and have been very happy with it  I did a lot of research into SUV s before picking the Ford Explorer  The Toyota 4 Runner seems  overall  a better vehicle  but it is underpowered and sluggish in comparison  even the v6  very expensive  and does not come in the more economical 2 door Sport version that the Ford comes in  And the Jeep Cherokee  for the same money had none of the cool doo dads that came with the Explorer I opted for the fully loaded vehicle  It is very comfortable  has a fantastic sound system  and its SOHC engine has all the pickup I need  The compass temperature gauge rocks  and the tissue dispenser is indispensable  I have made several road trips with up to 4 people  and everyone was comfortable the entire time  Also  it s really easy to fold the back seats down for extra cargo space  One of my favorite things about the truck is its turn radius  It has an awesome turn radius  None of the other trucks I test drove could make such incredibly tight turns  But it does have some problems  Ever since I got the truck  the air bag warning light has been flashing erratically  Sometimes it stays on  sometimes it flashes  and sometimes it doesn t come on at all  The air bag warning light does frighten me  but according to the user s manual  there is a warning beep that will sound along with the light when there s a real problem with the air bag  I have had the truck serviced by Ford mechanics and another service shop as well  and neither garage could fix the problem  Also  for the first year I had the truck  whenever I would use my turn signals  the windshield wipers would turn on  this was good for a laugh but not much else  This weird bug was fixed by Ford mechanics  I would not recommend this 2WD vehicle for off roading  and it sucks in the snow  It handles dirt roads better than a sports car  but I wouldn t trust it in real hard core off road situations  Then there is  of course  the tire recall I have very little confidence in the electrical system of the truck  which makes me glad I leased it instead of buying  My doubts as to whether or not I will lease another Ford have more to do with Ford s eagerness to sell people death traps than with how much I ve enjoyed driving my truck  They re losing so much money from the Firestone recall though  they ll probably have to offer really good deals  I probably will lease another Ford Explorer Sport  but I will not buy one  and I will make damn sure I m not being sold recalled tires  I wouldn t put it past them to try br br  
Pos, My sister got a 1999 Ford Explorer 2WD 2 Door Sport for her 16th birthday  It was a great SUV to start off with  At first  everything was great and nothing went wrong  Now from what we thought was a little problem we re ending up having a big problem  The first thing to go wrong was the back seat head rest  After it went up it didn t come back down  The Ford dealership had to send it to an upholstery shop so they could take the seat apart to get the headrest back down and they still have not fixed  It takes them 2 days just to figure out they have to order a part for this seat and they still have not gotten the part in  Next  the front passenger seat wouldn t slide up  Well after that was fixed  we had the bomb dropped on us  THE TIRES  She HAD Firestone Wilderness tires on her Explorer and they ve been recalled  The tread is coming off and the tires are worthless  so to speak  The worst part is is that we are in the 3 phase of the recall so it will not be until next year that we can have her tires replaced  It had been bearable until we found this out  I do  however recommend the Explorer  I just recommend that you check the serial number on the tires before you make your final decision  Other than these few problems  the Explorer has been a joy to drive br br  
Pos, I bought a 1996 Mustang GT convertible in late 96 with 4 000 miles on it  It looked great and seemed a great way to take advantage of the Atlanta weather Three years later  how do I feel  Well  it s been a lot of fun and I m converted to convertibles  The Mustang itself has limitations  understandably given the price  The only design criterion is power as there are niggly issues elsewhere  such as if you use the cup holder  it is difficult to use the handbrake  And you need a handbrake because if you get this car you should be buying a manual transmission  Why would anyone buy an automatic sports car As for other design quality issues  I had problems with the driver s seatbelt fraying  The lower guide was rough and gradually wore through the belt  Also  the handbrake was misaligned within the center console  causing the rubber edging to the slot in the console to tear  The a c also failed and took 3 attempts for the dealer to fix  A piece of the roof came loose and had to be replaced The roof is pretty quick to put up or down  about 15 seconds  but requires a bit of manual effort to lock into place or unlock  especially compared with the Toyota Solara Convertible I now own Road noise is not bad for a convertible  albeit not as quiet as more expensive models I ve been in  The car is OK for reasonably long journeys  as long as you don t have to sit in the back There is tremendous acceleration if you get the revs right  If you don t  you get zero benefit from at least half the 4 6L engine as Ford Escorts can give you a run for your money  And if it s wet  don t even think about using the accelerator  If you do anything more than contemplate putting your foot down  the rear end will be all over the place  even if going in a straight line  or trying to The handling is good when dry  and the ride us hard  as you would expect from a sporty car  If you live in a neighborhood with speed bumps  make sure you test drive going over them before buying the car I ve owned other Fords and  like them  the gear shift and clutch operation is smooth  with a clear response to tell you you are in gear Still  on a nice day  it s great to put the top down and hear the noise of the V8  The top goes up and down pretty easily  It takes 15 seconds  The car looks even better with the rear cover  but that is so difficult to put on that I ve only used it twice There is a surprising amount of room in the trunk  The rear seats are very cramped for anyone bigger than a small child  I have a 10 year old that complains about lack of room  so I ll be trading it in soon Fuel economy  No idea  I m English and the gas in Georgia seems virtually free to me  compared with  5 gallon in the UK  so I never measured it  I believe that the official figures are low 20s If you want fun in a convertible  this is a fairly cheap way of achieving it  Don t expect practicality or high design though  If you want that  pay 50  more and get a BMW     
Pos, I had a 1996 Ford Mustang GT  I say had  because the car was leased  I turned the car in because 1  driving a 5 speed in Chicago s traffic was driving me nuts  2  rear wheel drive during winter in Chicago is a horrible experience  and 3  my wife just had a baby and we needed more space Don t be mislead from the above statements  I loved this car  It had lots of power  It looked great  It took off from the starting line like a rocket ship  It took the corners like it was on rails  Overall  the Ford Mustang is just a fun car to drive  I must admit  however  that I was pleasantly surprised at the ride of this car  It was much smoother than previous models I had little to no problems with the car except for the front end alignment going out on me  What didn t I like  In 1996 Ford replaced the 5 0L engine with the 4 6L engine  The gas mileage isn t that great I have driven the Chevy Camaro  the Pontiac Firebird  and even the Chevy Corvette  I own a  72  and I would have to say that the Mustang is much more fun to drive than the Camaro or the Firebird  It not in the same league with the Corvette  but it is the next best thing Who should buy the car  Only people without children Who should not buy drive the car  Parents who s 16 year old kid just got his driver s license     
Pos, I bought this vehicle in February of 1996  when it had first been released  The dealer had it before I did  and the car was in excellent condition with about 3000 miles on it  Fully loaded  I love this car  I was in the military for a while and it got me from Texas to New Jersey almost twice a year if not more  This is the best vehicle I have ever owned  It is fun  sporty and reliable  I get a smooth ride out of it EVERY time I drive  no matter what the road conditions are like  If you like this type of  quot luxury quot  vehicle without the prices  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone who loves to drive and look good br br  
Pos, Get an old Tempo and stick to your beat   Yes  we re talking music here   I have been and still am the proud owner of three Ford Tempos  A l987  a 1989 and a l990  I am a woman who drives approximately 40 to 80 miles a day in all kinds of weather  I am a consistent driver  in that I keep relatively the same speed for the same length of time while commuting to and from work  These cars are easy to drive and easy to control  They are great in snow and icy conditions  They have a front wheel drive that s excellent WITHOUT snow tires  and I live in Northern New York State  near the Canadian border  The gas mileage is great and at a steady pace of just below 55 miles and hour I use almost no gas at all  If you re a careful driver  mind the speed limit and don t peel out too often  I d sure recommend a Tempo to you  There s just nothing about these low key cars I don t like  I ve been driving them for 12 years  Blue Book value should increase  in my opinion  br br  
Pos,  This opinion comes from a girl with no experience with trucks of any kind except maybe the toy trucks I buy my son  This is strictly a review on why I like it  not on anything under the hood i My boyfriend loves trucks  I had never driven a standard before  Since we both use the vehicle I thought buying a truck wasn t a smart idea  He said I needed to learn  He earns the money  I was out voted We just bought our Ranger last week  It was only  600 00  definitely in our budget  I must say that I am pleased  The truck is great on gas which is a major plus with the gas prices rising and falling everyday  Although  it isn t a full sized truck  it can carry a load a lot bigger than you would think it could  The cab isn t very roomy but it gives me and my boyfriend some  quot close quot  time lol I learned how to drive it in a day which surprised me because I m not very coordinated when it comes to doing more than one thing at a time  and no it s not because I m blonde  It was very easy to learn on  The truck is still in great running condition for being 10 years old and having over 100 000 miles on it  It s not too big either which is great for me so I don t try to run people over if they get in my way I was very pleased with our purchase and would recommend a Ford Ranger for anyone in the market for a cheap  dependable little truck  It s a great one for us women drivers br br  
Pos, I m in the market for a new car and have been test driving lots of vehicles lately  When one is a serious candidate  I also look around for one I can rent for a couple days to take on a business or family trip to get a better feel for how it works for me in a day to day situation b i Most of the vehicles I ve been driving recently have been well equipped 4 door sedans in the  25 35 000 range  but a lot of my friends and neighbors have been buying big trucks  and I ve got to admit  there s a certain appeal to the truck  I ve had small Toyota trucks before and I always liked having the open cargo area  which gave me the flexibility of buying big items on impulse or doing home improvement projects easily  No need for delivery  I can just load that topsoil into the back of my truck  thank you very much b i I m a firm believer in considering as many options as possible in order to really know what s best and to really get the best deal  Comparing apples to oranges can be loads of fun when buying a car  A few days after driving the Ford F 150  I went into a Mercedes dealership to check out the C 230  The saleswoman asked what kinds of vehicles I was comparing to the Mercedes  I rattled off the de rigueur competitors  like the BMW 330 and Jaguar X type  then threw in  and a Ford F150 crew cab  The look on the woman s face was priceless   We don t compete with pickups  she informed me with a sneer  I had to struggle to keep a straight face b i Unfortunately for her  it is the  customer  who defines the competitive landscape   not  the salesman  and  definitely  not any suit wearing monkey from corporate marketing  She didn t understand that  and it s her loss because the C 230 was a good car and she  could  have gotten a sale if she was smart enough and quick enough to deal with a smart a s customer like me who happened to have been shopping with a checkbook in hand     i Smack i   We don t give a poop  Get back to talking about the Ford Oh yeah  right  This is a Ford F 150 review  Sorry about that  My impressions of this vehicle are based mostly on a 2 day weekend rental from Thrifty Car Rental  yes  some locations  do  rent pickups   by the way  here in Houston  Budget seems to be a good place to rent Ford Rangers if you like driving small pickups  I also test drove the King Ranch version at a local Ford dealer  but just as a 30 minute test drive   can t tell as much from that  but it s kind of fun to check out the fully loaded deal b i b Exterior Styling  Fit and Finish  and Etc  Too  I like the looks and styling of full size Ford trucks  They aren t as boxy and square as they used to be  but they still look utilitarian enough to be taken seriously as trucks and not as glorified cars with a little cargo space tacked on  which is I how I view some new trucks  which I will identify only as Ford Explorer  Nissan Frontier  and Chevrolet Avalanche     Ground clearance is excellent  even with the two wheel drive versions  Of course that means that short people are going to feel like they re forever climbing Mt  Everest just to get up into the thing  but that s the price you pay for driving one huge hulking chunk of Dearborn steel  If somebody complains  tell the girly man to get a Volkswagen b i I really like the  feel  of the F 150  Everything feels thick  heavy  and substantial  One of the things I didn t care for when I drove a Toyota Tundra was the way things  clicked  when they should have  clunked    do you know what I mean  I expect doors on a full size truck to feel  heavy   A thin door feels okay on a little Tacoma truck  but not okay on Tundra  What I want on the Tundra is a door that feels like the door on a F 150  It feels like a man s door  not like a little kid s door  Ditto on the tailgate  Ditto on the front hood  Toyota makes a good  reliable truck  I m sure of it  but they don t make a full size truck that  feels  as good as a Ford  Dodge  or Chevy full size truck b i i Right Bed for You i There s a bit of an on going debate over the  right  bed length for a full size truck  The problem is that with trucks like Ford s F 150 Super Crew  the overall length isn t really increased over what you get with a standard or extended cab   Ford s engineers simply stole the space for that back seat from the bed  The argument I always hear is  well  people don t carry stuff that requires a long bed     They don t  eh  Well  maybe a typical family doesn t often want to carry huge bulky things  nor do the firefighters depicted in Ford s oh so heartwarming commercials  but other people  do   Yes  the short bed will do fine for carrying boxes  boots  maybe even some rolled up fire hoses  What it won t do fine at is carrying the kinds of things that most people in the construction trades want to carry b i Think about it and think about what people who work for living typically want to carry  What length are most boards  Sheet rock  PVC tubes  Fence posts  Conduit  Ladders  Right  8 feet to 12 feet  Not 5 feet   at least not at the Lowes I go to b i In my opinion  the bed is  too short  on the Super Crew   especially for anyone considering this vehicle as a work truck  Yes  you  can  put the tailgate down  Yes  you  can  use one of those extender racks to give yourself a little extra occasional space  but don t those only give you about 7 feet max     In my opinion  the tailgate and extender strategy is  not  quite as good as having a genuine 8 foot bed  which you can also drop the tailgate down on giving yourself 10 feet  Some guys are  going  to want more space in the cargo area than you get on the typical Super Crew cab F 150     Before you buy this truck  think about whether the bed length is a problem for you  If you are a typical suburban mom who just wants a snazzy looking beefy vehicle to drive around town  then hey  no biggee  Go for it  But if you re working in the trades and thinking about using this vehicle  as a truck   then think long and hard about whether that bed is adequate  otherwise you ll be regretting the purchase for a very long time b i b Interior Comfort  Features  and More Etc  Too  The big draw on this big truck is the interior space  You get a real live back seat  genuinely usable back doors  and enough space to seat 5 comfortably  6 if you have a bench style front seat  even on longer trips  No more scrunching or using the back seat of extended cab trucks as seating only for contortionists and short midgets b i This is really the perfect truck for families  I like the looks of the extended cab better than the super cab  but for practical value and overall utility and comfort  the super cab is tough to beat  Because I m a dad  I always check out the back seat when I look at cars  I want easy access for moving car seats in and out and putting little people into their seats  I also prefer quite a bit of leg room  not so much to make things comfortable for adults  but so that little feet find it not so easy to kick the back of the drivers seat  Hey  We all have different perspectives on these things b i Most people are probably going to go for the XLT version of this truck because it offers everything that most people want today while at the same time  keeping the price somewhat reasonable  It s got a nicely appointed interior with automatic transmission  air conditioning  power windows and door locks  stereo with CD player  cruise control  captain style bucket seats with lumbar support and power adjustment on the driver side  and a console between the two front seats  As I said  a comfortable combination  Ford also offers a Lariat package  leather upholstery is the big plus there  and specialty versions called the King Ranch version and the Harley Davidson version b i i King Ranch package  The King Ranch version that I drove at Central Ford had the Highland Green paint  which is a very deep forest green  Together with the brown leather interior with the independent captains chairs in front  it was a sharp looking vehicle   no doubt about it     I wonder how well their  rugged  sales pitch is going to do  I sure didn t buy it  My opinion is that the King Ranch version is not a very practical vehicle for rugged use  I d call this truck the  Waltham Soccer Mom  edition  It s plushy  power everything  and too overloaded to be a real practical work truck  I could  never  see it really being used on a ranch  a construction site  nor anywhere else where rugged conditions prevail   Hey  Get your muddy boots off that plush pile carpet  You raised in a barn or sumpin  I laughed out loud when I saw the heated seats in the King Ranch version  Last I heard  the King Ranch was about as far south as you can be and still be on U S  soil  Do you know  where  the real King Ranch is  I do because I drive through it fairly often  It s in south Texas  only a couple dozen miles north of the Mexican border  It s an area where palms grow and coastal farmers raise grapefruits and ranchers raise as many cactuses as steers  Not exactly the kind of climate where heated seats might come in handy  Yep  on those icy cold 80 degree winter days when the nor westers blow through you really wanna crank up the heated seats  Sure  nuff  this is the truck for  real  Texas cowboys  Uh huh b i Don t even get me started on Ford s  Harley Davidson  package b Power  Performance  and Yet More Etc b The truck I drove had the 260 horsepower 5 4 liter Triton V 8 engine  With that powerplant  the truck was very responsive  Ford also offers a smaller 4 6 liter V 8 in the F 150s  but with only 220 horses at its beck and call  that seems too little for a truck as big and heavy as the F 150   especially if you plan to pull a trailer   220 horsepower is about what many family sedans have     According to Ford  this truck can tow up to 8 000 pounds and has a payload capacity of 1 765 pounds  Hmmm  I could even take my mother in law for a ride I was impressed with the handling of this truck  The advantage of shortening the bed and keeping the overall vehicle length about the same as with the extended and regular cabs is that the vehicle doesn t handle like a tank   The F 150 Super Cab has a 139 inch wheelbase  Sure  it s not going to corner like a Z3 would  but it turns tightly for its size and is easy to get used to  I don t see anyone having a problem handling this truck in normal suburban traffic b i The truck is equipped with power anti lock brakes and in normal driving conditions  the braking felt good  I don t recall trying a hard brake situation with this truck   sorry b i b General Impressions  Conclusions  and Any Remaining Etc b Official info on features  performance specs  pricing  etc  for these trucks is on the web at  www fordvehicles com trucks f 150 Prices are a bit high on the F 150   the one I drove runs about  27 000 MSRP   however  I have recently seen quite a few ads from Ford dealers in the local area offering these trucks with the XLT package at prices around  22K  I think  27K is too much for this truck  and I wouldn t pay that price  but at the  22K level  it becomes a a fair value and I might consider it seriously b i For my purposes  the Ford F 150 represents a pretty good package for use as a family car  and I might come back to it if I can t find a better deal elsewhere  Stay tuned for more info on the Great Car Purchasing Adventure of 2002  Til next time  see you in the showroom b i  
Pos, The truck I purchased and am reviewing is a 2002 Ford F 150 Supercrew with the  FX4 Offroad  package new for 2002 I love this truck  If you think about it  when was the last time you were able to pull over at a garage sale with you and three people loaded into your SUV  buy that large enlongated oversized treasure you just had to have  and stuff it into the rear  Only to have to drive home in icy conditions Well  this hasn t happened to me yet here in Southern California  but who knows The point is  when I first saw the Supercrew a few years ago  I fell in love with the concept  I could still do somewhat oversized hauling  and at the same time fit one   two   three   four   five   or even six people into the cabin  and still have headroom  To me  the Supercrew exceeds the practicality of  and in itself is a superior SUV The short 5 6  bed is questionable for any type of tradesman  Since I won t be using it as a work truck  it suits me very well  Mine came with a  cargo cage   bed extender  and will haul my surfboards very handily  The model I purchased has the 5 4L Triton V8 motor  I find it to have more than enough power  It sounds like a big V8 during acceleration and quiets down nicely when up to speed and cruising  Of course it also likes to drink its lions share of gasoline  I m not sure what the mileage is  but I don t think I ll expect anything better than 14 mpg on the highway  even with the 3 55 limited slip rear end It s equipped with an automatic transmission  and shift  on the fly  4x4 transfer case  I can engage 4 wheel drive from the dash while driving less than 55 mph The FX4 Offroad package upgrades the Supercrew for individuals who like aggressive four wheeling  It includes skid plates beneath the transfer case  gas tank  and front axle assembly  They lifted the truck  tastefully  and stiffened the suspension with heavy duty shocks  It also includes 17 inch aluminum five spoke alloys  with Goodyear AT S LT 265 70 tires  They also throw in stainless steel lug nuts  To finish the FX4 package off  they include a red  FX4 Offroad  decal  two tone paint  and a matching red decal stripe separating the two tones of paint  FMC must be trying to attract sportier  younger buyers Personally  I m not into the offroad thing  I m looking to buy some acreage with incline  and I do like to go skiing  So this big heavy 4WD without the leather interior will do me fine Downsides 1  The vertical size is such that I wont be able to fit it into my garage if I decide to install any type of rack system 2  It gets very poor gas mileage  so for those who commute unless money grows out of your pockets  it doesn t lend itself to becoming a daily driver 3  Being a non traditional SUV  it s missing a third row of seats  and luggage storage is a problem on trips unless you enclose the bed Overall the truck lives up to the image that Ford creates with their  big truck built tough  advertising strategies  It drives with surprising comfort considering it has the offroad suspension  and doesn t drift like aftermarket lift kits tend to do Since it s new  dependability has yet to prove itself I also purchased a 2002 Thunderbird on the same day  If you would like to read its review  you can copy and paste   a href content 51622219396 http www epinions com content 51622219396 a Good luck and happy driving  
Pos, In previous years I always thought of the Taurus as my Grandfather s first choice  but since the revamp of few years ago my whole opinion has changed Over the past twelve years I have always driven T Bird s  but in 1997 the T Bird was put to rest for a major overhaul and I began to look at the Taurus  I am really glad that I did First off  the interior is really comfortable and roomy for this size vehicle  The dashboard contains exactly what you need  speedodometer  fuel  and a few other things that you need to know  The sound system is outstanding for a stock item  A C and heat perfect  One of my favorite items is the flip up console which is hidden under the arm rest  this allows you to use it or hide it  In the console you can store eight cassettes and has space for that soda coffee on the way to work  The back seats flip down for access to the trunk  not a feature that I would ever use  but I am glad that it is there  Speaking of the trunk  I have not seen this type of space on vehicles this size in many many years Performance and handling have been more than I could expect  Gas mileage has been a very respectable as most of my driving is over the tollway freeway  Appearance and paint surface are brilliant and show no sign of fading over the past two years  Interior buttons dials are large and very easy to access from the drivers seat  One nice feature is the drivers side power window has a  quot one push quot  down button  touch it and your window opens all the way  I know it sounds silly that I cant hold the little button for a few seconds  but I really like the one touch feature Visibility is great  todate I have not had any issues of blind spots With all the good  I do have one item that is poor  When driving on the freeway  exactly at 55MPH   and either the driver or passenger window is down there is a very annoying wind vibration that fills the car  I can t really explain this sound  but it is kind of like a monk humming over and over and over directly behind your head rest This vehicle that comes in under  20K is well worth your investment  I never thought I would own drive a Taurus  but I sure am glad that Ford took this car back from Grandpa br br  
Pos, I had leased a Ford Taurus for 3 years  and although not too flashy or great in any one area  it is a pretty nice set of wheels  Its dependable  runs smooth and with no problems at all in my experience  Once the automatic locked doors weren t functioning properly  and needed to be fixed  but that was most likely an isolated problem to my car The interior is comfortable and it is relaxing to sit in  Althought a  quot compact quot  car  it doesn t really feel like it as there s plenty of space  It also seems that your a bit higher up while driving  also giving the feel of more room compared to smaller cars The exterior of the taurus is although plain and common looking  still pretty good There isn t much bad to say about this car  though it isn t the greatest either  I do recommend it to anyone who is intrested in buying a car  all ages  families  single people  it doesn t matter  this car can fit you br br  
Pos, I bought a Taurus GL with power package  cruise  automatic  cell phone  6 disc cd changer in late 97  It was a previous rental with 15000 miles so I was able to defray some of the initial depreciation  and have been satisfied every day since  I have always been a Honda man and have generally steered clear of american cars for their rapid depreciation  however when we had our second child I found it difficult to go on long trips with the stroller  port a crib  luggage  and various other newborn necessities due to the limited trunk space that Honda s have I started looking around at larger cars  I wanted something with a v6  plenty of room  comfortable on long trips  limited outside noise there is nothing worse than listening to the wind outside for hours and hours on long trips cruise and power amenities and a cell phone in case of emergencies I got all of that with the Taurus  with plenty to spare  It is plenty roomy the trunk is nothing short of Huge  very comfortable on long trips  I can take all of the hills with ease  a definite joy to drive  My one suggestion would be too consider one with a little bit of mileage as long as it has been cared for to cut down on depreciation  I was looking at a new 97 when I bought mine with most of the same features for 24Grand  I picked up mine with 15000 miles for 15Grand  Can you see the initial depreciation on these vehicles  I currently have 50 thousand miles on mine  I take it in for regular maintenance and have had no serious problems  I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a family who enjoys traveling br br  
Pos, I ve owned 5 cars in my lifetime now  and I can honestly say that this is the most comfortable commuter car of all  I commute around 150 miles each day and now have 125 000 miles on this car  And yet the only thing I ve had to replace is the alternator  battery  tires and the windshield wiper mechanism  This is a solid car with the highest safety rating possible with my insurance company  As an added bonus  it seats 6  while you d be hard pressed to find a car that does that these days If I had to complain  though I don t want to  it would have to be about this unexplicable  quot popping quot  sound while making turns  This has only happened occasionally  and it s occured since the first day I ve owned the car  I m willing to bet that this is a flaw of this particular car s design  rather than reflecting a flaw on the entire series  I have had it checked out several times and no one seems to be able to fix it or even tell me what it is  It hasn t caused me any problems though except mild bewilderment  I owned a 1990 Cutlass Calais before this car  Although they were both excellent vehicles  I d have to say that I like the style and comfort of the Taurus better  I would recommend a 97 or older Taurus to anyone and everyone  I bought it used with 24 000 miles on it  for  15 000  minus  5 000 from the trade in on the Cutlass  when I started college  hoping it would last until I graduated  I am starting my senior year this fall  I have 131 000 miles on it and no major problems yet     
Pos, I am not first in line to bash American vehicles and I am also not a Ford disciple  which means I am able to remain objective about this car  My feeling is that this isn t that bad of a car  yet not great  I purchased my Taurus GL used in 2001 with 70K miles and it now is at 130K There are a few things that bother me about the car  but the transmission has always been my greatest concern  Not long after I purchased the car there was a strange hiccup while driving that seemed to happen after longer trips  I never determined what caused it although it hasn t happened for a long time  It could actually have been the brakes which I replaced  although it felt like it was in the transmission  More recently  I had a very strange problem with my transmission which started with alternator and power steering problems  Both would malfunction while driving  which later I found was caused by some kind of transmission sensor module  I later found out that if you don t fix it immediately  it really messes up your overdrive  which is what I am experiencing now I would say the other problems with the car are more annoying than major  The interior lights have a tendency to stay on after you shut the door  which I solved by pulling out the bulbs  The interior in my car is cheap and the rear window is hard to clean because of its oddball shape  Also on a more personal note  the person who owned the car prior to me burned holes in the interior and stunk up the car with their smoking habit  I still cannot get all of the smell out  which annoys me  On the good side  the V 6  3 0 liter Ford standby has been a good performer I used semi synthetic oil in it  which may or may not help  If not for the transmission I would be more than happy with the car  adding that Scosche sells kits for getting rid of the stupid stereo console  It is what many people call a  grandpa car  but if you are not vain about those things it is not a bad car  If you are mindful of the transmission problems and take steps to prevent the problems  it could be a good deal used  
Pos, I received an invitation in the mail from a new car dealership that just opened in Kenton  Ohio back in August of 1999  Statewide Ford had bought out another dealer and was having a kind of grand opening  Present this letter and test drive any vehicle and receive a free tool kit  What I got was one mean SHO  A 2 year old  just turned in from a lease with only 21 000 miles  burgandy with tan interior  chromed spoke rimmed  leather seated  3 4 liter  32 valve  duel overhead cam  fuel injected V8 with a moon roof and am fm cassette player with 6 CD changer in the trunk  auto temp a c and heat  auto lights  and a leather covered steering wheel  Oh  did I mention it will do every bit of the 150 mph that the speedometer registers  Well  it will  And the best part is it was only  16 000  I wouldn t trade it for a field full of Monte Carlos  Grand Prix  or Intrepids  Despite how fast it is and how well it handles it s also my family car  Fixed or repaired daily  Not this Ford  I love everything about this car and hate nothing about it  I wouldn t recommend it to the faint of heart or someone who thinks only a mechanic can raise the hood  After all  I do add my own windshield washer fluid br br  
Pos, I picked up a 1997 Taurus SHO after looking over several  quot sporty quot  four door sedans  The car is very refined for a Ford  Almost everything in the car is improved or updated over the V6 Taurii  It has SHO specific engine  brakes  transmission  steering  upholstery  the list goes on Ford did not market the SHO very well  They are hard to sell  For this reason  new SHO s can be found at the dealer for thousands under MSRP Positives The car is a performer  It is not a stoplight racer so much as it is an executive cruiser  It has the brakes and suspension to keep up with the motor  but not at the expense of a comfortable ride It has been 100  reliable since the day I bought it  It is the most trustworthy car I ve ever owned Good ergonomics  One could drive this car for hours on end with little driving fatigue Negatives The styling is definitely love it or hate it  The V8 is thirsty  Frisky drivers can expect no better than 15 mpg in the city The oval shaped stereo   climate controls make it nearly impossible to upgrade the sound system br br  
Pos, My husband and I bought a new 2004 Ford Focus ZX3  comfort package  this past weekend  and here are my impressions so far  it is a really great little car  very responsive  very easy and fun to drive  and has enough pep with the 2 liter engine  We also tested the Toyota Echo and the Focus felt much better  We were planning on buying a Hyundai  either an Accent or an Elantra  just because they re so inexpensive and they ve got that great warranty  But the Hyundais FELT cheap  By comparison  the Focus feels VERY well put together  very solid  very reliable  There s a lot to love about the Focus  lots of head and legroom  plenty of cargo space with the seats folded down  they re really cute  very easy to drive  fun even  There are a few things that I ve discovered I really like  such as the fact that the reverse lights are VERY bright so you can actually see where you re going when you back up  the turning radius is great  I live in a big city so this is a plus  the seats are quite comfortable  the gauges are easy to read  and the controls are simple and easy to get used to  I like the fact that the cabin lights come on automatically when you turn the ignition off  that s really handy  A few things I ve discovered kind of annoy me about this car  the main thing I don t like is the clock  I have the CD MP3 player stereo  and when the radio is off  it s fine  but if you re playing a CD or listening to the radio  the time is displayed in the bottom left corner and is so small that it s difficult to read  you have to press the  clock  button on the upper right to get the time to display across the top for a few seconds  I wish it was the other way around  you had the clock display all the time and had to press a button to see what track or station you were listening to  Another thing is the overdrive  I don t know if this is standard for AT s with OD  but its default is ON  and you have to press a button to turn it off if you re driving in the city  on hills  etc  Since I live in a hilly city and rarely drive the freeways  this is kind of annoying  since I have to remember to turn it off every time I turn the car on  The seatbelts are a little far back  requiring a bit of a reach  Other than that  I am completely happy with this car  
Pos, Well I don t know where to start about my rig  My wife and I recently had a lil boy  and the truck we had a 1998 Dodge Dakota Sport extended cab was just not big enough to handle a car seat in the back for the lil man  My wife called me one day while she was out of town and told me that I should start shopping for a new rig  So that was what I started doing  I new that Chevy was coming out with a new Super Duty rig  I also knew that Dodge made a good 2500 rig  So in all fairness I really started shopping around  I drove the new Chevys  Dodges  and the Fords  In fact one dealership went to the local Chevy and Dodge dealerships and borrowed a brand new 2500 Chevy and 2500 Dodge  Both gas engines  I drove them both then drove the Ford again  He then brought over a Chevy 2500 diesel and a Dodge 2500 diesel  Drove both of them  and again as before I drove the Ford again  Well to make a long story short  I literally took one month to shop for a truck  Now here are the reasons why I chose the Ford over the competition  1  The Ford drives like a truck  I personally buy a truck to ride like a truck  Not a Cadillac  The Chevy truck yes is a very beautiful rig  however when going down a bumpy road I didn t feel to of the road  Personally that is not what I want  I want to be able to feel the road  2  The Dodge transmissions have been known to have a lot of problems  I personally had to have the transmission of my Dakota replaced 2 times  When I was looking for a truck I went to a very close friend that just happened to be the service manager of the local Dodge dealership  He informed me that the fullsize trucks have more problems with their transmissions than any other truck on the market  3  The Dodge Diesel was the loudest diesel on the market  Even in the cab of the truck the knocking of the engine could be heard  4  The Ford V 10 was by far the most powerful gas engine on the market  The Ford was a lil less roomy than the Chevy  but it road like a truck should ride  Like a truck  The Ford Diesel was by far the well excuse my French but it was the ballsiest diesel I have ever driven  I was sitting at a stop lite and I punched it with out even thinking about  Wow  Is the only thing I could say  The truck actually squawked its tires at the line and was in the process of spinning them when I let off the accelerator  That was very impressive in my mind  I bought my truck which has the following options  F 250 Super Duty XLT  V 10  Supercab  4x4  Air Conditioning  Stereo cassette  CD Player  3 75 rear end  towing package  towing mirrors  Not a lot of options  But it is by far the dream truck that I have always wanted  I can t think of a better truck to own  I am currently in the process of making it my absolute dream truck  I have been told that with a 3 inch lift a set of 38 will fit just fine  Well I am about to find out  Well since I put this e pinion on here  I have made some changes to my truck  It is now 6 inches taller with 35 s underneath  And one hell of a lot more powerful  The only cons that I have is the seat belt design in the front and the lack of child seat anchor points  As fas as the seat belts  well I am a large man and when I get out of the truck if I am in a hurry and don t look back my seat belts get all tangled up in the door when it closes  And the child seat anchors are something that all vehicles should have in them  but you have to order them from the dealer  and then they will put them in  Thankfully free  These are my only complaints  
Pos, I recently purchased my 92 thunderbird from a women who took good car of the car and was the only other owner  She has papers on everything that she has had done on the car  But  now it seems like I have been getting all of the headaches of the car  I have only had the car for 4 months and I have had to replace the alternator  belts  tires  and some gas filter thing  can t remember the name  I know that these are the standard things to go in the car  but the parts are VERY expensive  We have to other brands of Ford cars and their parts aren t nearly this expensive  This is my  1 warning the parts are expensive  Also my insurance tripled with this car and I have never even had an accident or speeding ticket  There are also many unidentifiable noises in the car  Popping noises from the brakes and somewhere in the back  There is also water leaking in when it rains  Of course the mechanics can t find out what is wrong  Overall the car is ok but not really worth all of the hassle and money I just recently got into a car accident with this car in April of 2001 and ended up totaling the car  I was hit on the drivers side by a dodge ram that was going 60 miles an hour  Luckily I walked away from the car with only a bruise from the seatbelt  I was very lucky  However the car had to be destroyed  The car held up very well in the accident and I was very surprised that I didn t get hurt  This car is very safe to drive around in and you won t have to worry about getting hurt if you do get in an accident  
Pos, Buying my first car four years ago I searched high and low to find what I thought to be the  quot perfect car quot   for my needs   400  and one lemon later  I realized that I needed to be a bit more circumspect when searching for a used car  I sifted advice from a dozen sources  read books and did a lot of looking around  My decision was to buy a  92 Ford Taurus with 119 000 miles as much as for the excellent offer as for the technical knowledge I d gained about the vehicle  A bit of background first on buying used cars  This is surely not comprehensive  One owner is always a plus  If you can find an older person who is willing to sell  that is also good  More likely than not  they will have religiously taken care of regular and preventative maintenance and will not have beat on the car as young people tend to do no matter the make or model  I might add  they drive it as if it s a sports car  It s also convenient to have access to all repair records  There are stores that will even run the VIN  vehicle identification number  to determine if it has had any factory work performed on it  I ve driven my car for four years now and I have logged over 35 000 miles bringing the total to 156 000 miles  I have driven in rain sleet  snow and hail  I ve driven on new tires  bald tires  performance tires and touring tires  I ve driven cross country and I ve driven locally  My point is  I ve taken this car through every condition possible  hmm haven t made it to the autobahn yet  and I m very familiar with it Over the four years I ve owned my Taurus  I have made substantial repairs  Thus far I ve replaced all four brakes  two front disk and two rear drums  all four struts  the water pump  four tires  one window motor  and two front CV joints These repairs have been costly  but they were necessary for the mileage and their cost was certainly leveraged by the utility I received from the vehicle  Most of the miles I ve logged have been highway miles from commuting  The vehicle  fully loaded with two passengers  would attain a fuel economy of 28 miles per gallon  avg  on long trips  more than 100 miles  For the shorter work home commute it averages 22 25  Around town  the average drops  but that is to be expected from the extremely reliable 3 0 V6  The engine is well known in auto circles as an economic choice that provides power when necessary  I have found it to be a great compromise without moving to a larger V8  The car accelerates well which is not only fun to do occasionally  but necessary when making quick and aggressive driving decisions  Indeed  most reviews will give the 3 0 L a hands down appreciation over its larger counterpart  the 3 8 L  because of its reliability  the latter has often had technical problems The ride of a vehicle or how well it handles inconsistencies in the pavement without disturbing the passenger depends on many factors  Certainly  the road is a factor  but so are tires  inflation and type of struts and shocks  Many cars today have progressive shocks which adjust to the road conditions and change the ride according to speed  Though they weren t standard  I chose to have these put in when I replaced them  With properly inflated tires the vehicle provides an excellent ride even more so at high speeds as compared to a smaller vehicle  The car has power steering brakes locks trunk windows as well as AC and a 4 speaker stereo  These amenities are all standard the GL  While the car has an average wheel base  an average length compared to other vehicles of similar size  the trunk is spacious  I was able to pack modest luggage for four people into my trunk with some room to spare  While I wouldn t recommend towing with the GL  I found it to have the capacity and power to capably transport a full load of people and their luggage One inherent problem with a seemingly large number of pre 1995 Tauruses  enough that this problem had a small write up in a major automotive magazine  seems to be a knocking in the front strut area  This has occurred in my vehicle  and while I don t see any dangerous effects such as uneven tire wear or sloppy steering  this doesn t mean that it couldn t propagate in the future besides  the sound is not only annoying  it causes alarm in my passengers sort of a bump in the night Though my be loved vehicle is aging  and I may soon have to lay it to rest  it was  dollar for mile  one of the best vehicles I ve purchased  and if you as a used car buyer are in the same position I was  I would encourage you to consider the Taurus as a possible vehicle br br  
Pos, If you re looking for a reliable and safe family sedan  then look no further than the Taurus  I ve had mine for nearly eight years and it still performs like the day I drove it off the dealer s lot  The car handles extremely well and has plenty of passenger and storage space to accommodate a family of four  The gas mileage is adequate  I d prefer it to be higher  but the ride is comfortable and the design is appealing to the eye  Price wise  there are few cars that can offer you what the Taurus does at its price  Overall  I have been extremely satisfied with my purchase and expect to keep this car for at least another 5 years br br  
Pos, I bought a 1992 Ford Taurus LX about 1 1 2 years ago  and haven t had any problems with it at all  Aside from regularly scheduled maintenance and the fact that I got into an accident  I haven t had to take this car to the shop for anything  The car has 108 000 miles on it now  I bought it with 97 000  and the engine is still as smooth as silk  It has a lot of power behind it  wiht a 3 3L V6 EFI engine  The front seat is roomy and has lots of features  but the back seat can tend to be cramped  especially with me driving  but for smaller people is still very roomy  I wouldn t giv this car up for anything right now and will keep it until it finally dies for the last time br br  
Pos, Every year or two  I decide that it s time to purchase a new car  My wife and I have owned several car models  and two motorcycles  Our last car was a 1997 Eddie Bauer Ford Expedition  This was a program car that we got a good deal on  We quickly racked up 50 000 miles on it  in just over a year  Last month  we decided to shop around for another SUV  We looked at the Dodge Durango  the Envoy  and a few other vehicles  However  we eventually ended up back at Ford  looking at the 2001 Expedition XLT  We bought it the same day  I guess when you find something you like  it s best just to stick with it b Seating  The Eddie Bauer model we owned did not have a third row seat  The salesman stated that the third row is now standard in the Expedition  The extra seat allows for comfortable seating for eight passengers  The third row is accessed by folding down the short seat on the passenger side of the truck  Because the third seat sits up higher than the front two rows  the leg room is much more limited  However  it still allows enough room for average size riders to remain comfortable  It is an added benefit knowing you can carry extra riders  with everyone in a seatbelt b Climate Controls  The Eddie Bauer Edition had a sunroof  which meant that there were no rear climate controls  I find this to be one of my favorite features  During the past few HOT weeks  the XLT seemed to cool down faster than my Eddie Bauer model did  The rear climate controls have vents in the second and third rows  The rear climate controls can be shut off from the main control switch that the driver operates  just in case you have young children that think it s fun to run the heater during Summer months b Engine  The Eddie Bauer has a larger engine  sporting the 5 4L Triton 8 cylinder engine  The XLT has a smaller  more fuel efficient  4 6L 8 cylinder engine  Both models are 4 wheel drive  I have not experienced a noticeable loss of power with the XLT  but have not taken either vehicle  four wheeling  I have ample power for passing  I towed my motorcycle and trailer on the Eddie Bauer model  with no noticeable lugging on the engine  The XLT does not come with a tow bar  and I haven t installed one yet  I believe that I may notice the difference in engine strength once I start using the truck for towing  Other than that  the power is more than sufficient for normal driving  I have been getting around 13 or 14 MPG in the city  and around 17 or 18 MPG on the highway b Radio Controls  The Ford Expedition comes with a decent stock sound system  I am not a power freak when it comes to speakers  As long as I can hear my music at a moderate level  without distortion  I am satisfied  The Ford Expedition delivers on this point  The sound system also comes equipped with a six CD changer  The CD changer is located in the center console  which is much larger than the older models  Ford removed the armrests which were installed on the older models  and extended the width of the center console to compensate  This allows for several additional CDs  other than the ones located inside the CD changer  The old center console did not even have enough room for the six CD jewels for the CD s inside the changer  The radio has rear controls  located on the back of the center console  These controls adjust volume  and change radio stations  It can be very irritating when a youngster realizes that they can change your station with their toes  while your tooling down the road listening to your favorite LRB song  BUT you can shut off the rear controls by pushing two of the pre set buttons on the radio  simultaneously b Remote Access  The Ford Expedition XLT comes with two remote control buttons  that allow you to lock or unlock the truck from a distance away  I have tested it from inside the house  and have successfully unlocked the truck  They claim that the controls are unique  There is also a keyless entry pad located beneath the driver s side door handle  which contains five buttons  with the numbers 1 through 10  two numbers per pad  The vehicle comes with a password  that allows you to unlock the door with a combination  A great feature in case you lock yourself out  I m still not sure where I stand on that issue as far as security goes  but I figure it would be quicker to break the window to steal a car  than try and figure out the password b Comfort  I liked the armrests that the older models of the Expedition had on them  However  I have adjusted my ride to allow for resting on the center console  The seats are very comfortable  and are great for long rides  I prefer the cloth seats of the XLT to the leather interior on the Eddie Bauer  because leather is VERY cold in the Winter and VERY hot in the Summer  The climate controls are efficient  the mirrors adjust easily  and the seats have numerous settings to get that  just right  position  In case you find the comfortable seat position  and find yourself short of the gas and brake pedals they have an adjustment for those as well  Just pusht the button  and they ll come to meet you b Handling  When discussing SUV s  you would expect to hear how they handle off road  However  I do not intend to drive mine off road  I got a 4 wheel drive vehicle to handle the sometimes treacherous Winter storms we get up North  Since I have only owned this model for two months now  I have not driven it in heavy snow  However  I have driven over the rough post Winter pot holed roads in my area  and it has handled the bumps well  Smooth as glass  No  Yet still comfortable  The vehicle corners well for a top heavy SUV  and accelerates smoothly  except on steep inclines b Car Seats  I still have one child in a carseat  I have found the Ford Expedition to be one of the best vehicles I ve owned in regards to installing removing carseats b Overall Impression  I have been happy with the Ford Expedition  I think that the highest compliment that an automobile manufacturer can receive is to have a customer duplicate their purchase  I have never owned a Ford product prior to the Ford Expedition  but have become a believer  at least in this model  The Ford Expedition costs a little bit more than some of the models in it s class  and less than others  The market has become flooded with SUV s  with everyone getting in on the action  In fact  four classes of SUV s have emerged  mirroring the car market  However  Ford Expedition is among the oldest and most time proven models of SUV on the road  As long as my Goodyear tires hold out  I ll be happy with my purchase  
Pos, When my friend Brian called me and told me he had bought a new car to replace his 1995 Ford Explorer  I thought he bought a more sensible car  maybe a sedan or something  Nope  I was completely wrong  Brain bought a 2001   Ford Expedition   with Eddie Bauer trim  Boy  that is quite a truck The   Expedition   is so large that it resembles a small school bus  However  it doesn t drive like a school bus  not that I have ever driven a school bus  and certainly doesn t look like one when you consider all that the   Expedition   offers i  So What Does it Offer     I know nothing about the engine and so forth  so I am focusing mostly on the interior of the car and the exterior appearance      You could use those as a mirror    Chrome  Boy  it sure is beautiful  I am not sure I would want to keep up with chrome  having to polish it and keep it clean and so forth  but it sure is pretty to look at on other people s cars  The   Expedition   has lots of chrome to look at  Between its chrome bumpers  both front and rear  and its chrome wheels  there are plenty of shiny surfaces to look at  Too bad you have to keep them polished and clean      Brrrr  It is cold  Darn  The windows and mirrors are fogging up    As it did today in D C  sometimes it snows  And snows  And snows  And other times  it ices  But then there are also the times when the windows just fog up  With the good old American defrosters on the   Expedition    that ice or snow or fog will melt right off  But what about the mirrors  They fog up and get icy as well  How do you clear those  Well  the   Expedition   offers something new and exciting  heated mirrors  No more foggy mirrors that wind up being useless  De fog them and they are ready to go    Speaking of the cold and the fog    Fog lamps  The Eddie Bauer line comes standard with fog lamps mounted below the regular head lamps  Fog lamps are not only for show  they also do help you maneuver in the fog  Another cool feature  heated seats  The driver and passenger seats are both heated  A very nice addition for those cold tushies  And  there is also automatic temperature control  Set the thermostat at  say  72 degrees  and it will stay there  automatically    Daddy  where should I put this    When you have little kids  or are just a pack rat yourself  you need lots of storage  Brian has two little girls  who are always in need of a tissue  another pacifier  a different CD  a cracker  or something else  Well  where do you put all those things that a child might need  How about in your ample storage  There are two consoles in the   Expedition    floor and overhead  The floor console has a general storage compartment  a coin holder  headphone jacks  a tissue holder  and 4 cupholders  The overhead console has map lights  sunglasses holder  a holder for your garage door opener  and a compass  Overall  there are 6 cupholders throughout the  quot cabin quot  of the   Expedition       Going on a trip    There is plenty of room for cargo  As long as you remove the 3rd seat  more on this in a minute  there is a large area for cargo  There are cargo tie downs on the floor of the truck and a luggage rack on the top of the truck  on the cargo rack  It is easy to add some small packages to the cargo by opening only the glass on the rear hatch  There is a window door split so that you can open only the glass or can open both glass and door together    Someone has been driving my truck    Brian is exceptionally tall  so when I got in the truck to drive it  I  of course  needed to adjust EVERYTHING ranging from the seat to the pedals  there are adjusting pedals for different height people  But when Brian gets back in the truck  there is a memory feature that resets the seat  mirrors  and pedals to his original setting  NICE    Daddy  I m bored    When going on long trips  the girls often get bored  The nice thing is  Brian s new car has a rear seat entertainment center  complete with a VHS VCR  Now Brian can put on a movie to keep the girls occupied during the trips  I am sure that is a Godsend  And  for the adults  entertainment  there is a 6 CD changer standard with the truck    Analog Gages    voltage  oil  water temperature  speed  odometer  fuel    Warning Lights    door ajar  4 wheel drive  seat belts  low washer fluid  bright  highbeam  lights on  Anti Lock Brakes  Cruise Control  parking brake  low fuel  check engine  airbag  temperature  low oil pressure  turn signals  and security system    Power locks  Windows  and Cruise Control      Removable Third Row Bench Seat      Remote Entry  Child Proof Doors  Airbags   Overall  I think this is a great truck  I don t see any negatives yet  except for the fact that it gets horrible gas mileage and that it is so expensive  Overall  it seems like a great truck  And it works GREAT with both girls  carseats  so Brian is happy  Judging from my experience driving the   Ford Expedition    I would recommend it to anyone who has the need for a SUV br br  
Pos, I didn t buy my Expedition so I could run errands in town  or drive my kids to practice  I bought it to tow our 5000 lb travel trailer and all of our camping gear  We couldn t have picked a better truck  With the 5 4 liter V8  3 92 limited slip rear end  and heavy duty tow package  we can pull 7300 lbs  The step up is very high  but once inside you re greeted by a panoramic view around you  A great feature is the power adjustable pedals which have a range of 4 inches  Believe me  they really make a difference  There is a 14 inch height differential between my wife and I  but we can both find a comfortable driving position  More importantly  my wife can remain a safe distance from the steering wheel air bag Reliability has been stellar  Based on the time tested F 150 chassis  the Expedition has proven itself both durable and reliable  Our experience has borne this out  After 6 months  15 000 miles and several towing trips  my Expedition has required only one unscheduled service call to repair a slow leak in one tire  yes  Firestone Wilderness   all four of which will be replaced by Ford in the next several weeks Gas mileage is a big drawback  I have averaged about 14 8 miles per gallon in mixed driving   10 when towing the trailer  But  again  I didn t buy it to replace my minivan  If you don t tow  you probably don t need the 5 4l engine  But even if you don t tow  the Expy offers size  safety and security for your family  
Pos, The sporty appearance is unmatched  The interior w comfort convenience group  rivals that of a limo  When inside the vehicle the interior lighting and optional leather interior create an atmosphere of comfort and luxury The stereo system performs well with a 6 disc changer as optional  The third seat area is a bit hard to access and not made for very tall people but is adequate  Removing the seat is a snap for extra storage space  It will also tip up for extra space in the cargo area  I have owned a Mustang and in my opinion the handling of the Expedition considering it s size  is comparable  The optional 5 4L V8 has tremendous power  The acceleration is scary for such a large vehicle  Both from a dead stop and while passing the performance is awe inspiring  Road noise is minimal  Shopping around and using dealer against dealer will save you 3 5K off of MSRP  Overall a great vehicle 9 out of 10 in my opinion  
Pos, Well  this is not the type of review that I generally write  I am a mom to 4 girls and am busy doing things related to raising them  I don t know much about the technical workings of cars  but I drive them A LOT  I really felt compelled to write an epinion about this car We recently traded in our Ford Contour and purchased the much bigger Crown Victoria  Try getting a family of six in a Contour  No can do  So out we went to buy a larger sedan for my hubby to drive  He is no car expert either so we had to drive and redrive and sit in every car that seated 5 6 passengers comfortably  We did this 23 302 times while we were deciding what was the best car for us The Crown Vic was our choice hands down  It is plenty roomy in the backseat  My teenagers and kindergartener have plenty of leg room and space for all the stuff they must carry no matter where they go  The front bench seat will sit 3  but the middle person is a bit cramped  The airbags make it unsafe to put a child there  but that is really the size of the space  However  we can put an adult there for short trips and it works okay The drive is really smooth and the car handles like a much smaller car  There is ample power on acceleration and people get out of your way because they think you are a cop  I especially like the way this car brakes  I don t know any technical terms  but it is very responsive The Crown Vic gets pretty good gas mileage  about 25 mpg on average  The tank holds about 20 gallons of gasoline  The gas cap is easy to get on and off The trunk is huge and has a safety release strap in the event that you should somehow become trapped in there  Great for those with adventurous youngsters  The only drawback of this car is that it is rear wheel drive  We feel that this issue was effectively dealt with the addition of traction control  which my husband swears by  We are thrilled by our purchase and it is a dream to drive this car  We got a great deal on the car and Ford gave us extra incentive 0  financing for 60 months  Can t beat it  I hope this review helps those that are not car experts  but want to find a really terrific car  The Crown Vic will not disappoint  
Pos, My wife and I purchased a 1999 Ford E 350 15 seater for our growing family  with our sixth child on the way  Our van is not loaded with options   while we have tint windows  cruise control and running boards  we opted for no carpet or power features to assist us in keeping the van clean with active children  and to minimize worries about equipment breakages down the years  We purchased using the Internet  Autobytel com  to locate a dealer and set a price  We are pleased with our vehicle  after three months  and with the purchase process Our van has the 5 4 liter V 8 engine  and it delivers very good power and acceleration  The gas mileage comes in at 14 16 mpg on the highway  and a consistent 11 12 mpg around town  The visibility while driving is excellent  with the height of the driver from the ground  and the large sidemounted mirrors  Due to the vehicle length  lane changes require slightly more planning than a conventional minivan  however the large mirrors provide excellent situational awareness  Both the turning radius and turning response are very good  and were much better than anticipated  Parking requires patience  but is not a difficult task  including parallel parking The rear bench removes very easily with two people  One person who is capable of lifting 60 pounds can remove the bench  as well  With the rear bench removed  there are twelve seats and a tremendous amount of cargo room  although thought must be put into to securing cargo in the rear to prevent shifting Do it yourself oil changes and fluid refilling are a cinch with this van  The engine was designed with easy access to wide mouthed filling spouts in mind  The great height of the bottom of the vehicle from the ground make it completely unnecessary to jack the vehicle for oil plug or filter removal We found the height of the vehicle made running boards necessary in order to facilitate the handling of children and groceries around the vehicle We have found our E 350 to be a superior value to any minivan out there  Fuel mileage and luxury features are the only advantage we have seen of a minivan over our conversion van br br  
Pos, My family and I own two Aerostars and we just love them We have three kids and need the extra room if we are going on a trip or to the grocery store My husband have also hauled many things with these vans  He used to work as a service tech for a window company and had to haul 3 hundred pound windows around for some of the services  He now works for a plumbing company and hauls pipe everywhere  We have had little trouble with these vans  The biggest problem we have had is a Transmission leak The vans are still running and one has over 150 000 miles on it and the other one has over 200 00 miles on it  These have been some of the best cars that we have owned and we got them both used  I could only hope that all the rest of the cars that we own are this good br br  
Pos, The 2000 Ford Econoline E350 12 passenger van we purchased in November is a perfect fit for our growing family  We ordered this van in August  before the birth of our 6th baby and while we had to wait a few weeks longer than anticipated  it was well worth the wait After driving a minivan for 6 years  the size of this van was a bit overwhelming at first  But I love the height when driving around town and on the interstate  Scraping ice and snow from the front windshield is tricky because of the height  Getting in and out of the van is good exercise for me  since we have not gotten running boards yet  The van handles wonderfully  even in snow  Parking the van is a learned skill  since some parking lots are designed with smaller parking spots  The cd cassette radio sounds great and is easy to use and program  The spaciousness of the van allows me to move pretty easily from front to back to help buckle and unbuckle my youngest kids from their car seats and there is plenty of space to put grocery bags during our monthly shopping trip  The only thing I have to complain about is the space between the front bucket seats and the engine hub  There is not enough space to sit sideways in the seat and slide around to the front This van is a must have for growing families  Even if your family hasn t outnumbered the seats in a minivan  the kids will eventually be too uncomfortable in the cramped space br br  
Pos, I have been looking for many years for a truck that will stand out from all others  I have found it  Ford has made many models and sold millions  I went to the Ford Dealership where I live and I was shopping for a truck and as I walked into the show room there it was  This truck was the big foot of all  Custom style with all the extra  This truck was made to stay in the showroom and their was not one other was like this one  I then looked it over and it had all I wanted and I was sold  I test driven  and I was surprised that this truck was made for me  I seen trucks of the same model on the lot and this one was made special  Large tires with mag s  California Concept detailing  I said to the sale man  I ll take it  There was group of people there wanting to take this truck out of the showroom and was told its sold  If I would of walked away and went on looking elsewhere it would of been gone  People come up to me and ask where did you get your truck  Its one of a kind custom made  Rear Cab is custom with closure of the body color and lock  Not with cab liner as most truck  This make more safe when traveling and packing all your extra in the rear  California Concept is a company that specializing in detailing with all the extra as tires and shields and medal steps side for that sporty look  If you go and look for a truck of this kind ask the dealership for information about California Concept  and then you will have a truck you will love  
Pos, We purchased a 1999 Ford F 150 in May of 1999  We bought the base model and added only the 60 40 seat  cruise control  and a cassette player  We bought the truck to serve as a reliable vehicle for me to commute to work in and for us to take long trips in  We kept the standard V 6 engine which works fine if you are towing a small trailor and reasonable loads  In fact  I have never run into a case where I needed a larger engine  but I am certain that towing a large trailor or heavy loads would tax the V 6  The manual transmission is great  and it shifts like a car  It is very forgiving  however  the clutch is stiff and could be difficult for someone with knee problems The truck handles the road very well in rain and snow  and I have only a couple of times wished for 4 wheel drive  We have traveled from NJ to La and from NJ to IL several times in the truck and it rides extremely well  There is plenty of room in the front seat  The rear seat on the other hand is not made for an adult to ride long distances in  We have put our two kids in the rear seat  and they seem happy  The 4th door makes putting a child into and removing a child from a car seat extremely easy  and a car seat fits perfectly behind either seat or in the middle of the rear seat  It is important to get measurements of the car seats though because some brands of car seats will not fit behind either seat  The bed of the truck is full sized so there is no problem hauling plywood unlike the new 4 door F 150s  I strongly recommend adding a topper  about  800 1200  since it greatly increases the utility and security of the goods you are hauling as well as nearly eliminating the disposing of garbage in the truck bed It is a difficult vehicle to enter so if you are going to have someone whose mobility is less than normal riding in the truck check to see how easy it is for them to enter and leave the cab  Whenever I drive my mother  I must give her a boost to get in and a hand out  Riding boards help but do not eliminate this problem  4 wheel drive makes this even worse Fuel economy is reasonable  I generally get 19 20 mpg normal use and about 21 22 on the highway  Overall it is a great truck for the price and a great vehicle to see the country in br br  
Pos, The F 150 Ford Series offers many people what they will be looking for in a full size truck  The front 60 40 seat offers comfort with driver side lumbar control  Lots of leg room and head room for those that don t like to feel boxed in  All of the climate controls and radio are well within reach to improve road safety  The front seat offers a flip down console that locks in place for added storage  The rear seat is good for smaller children but adults don t think there is enough leg room  Especially if the front passengers have there seats all the way back  The 4 doors make entering and exiting the vehicle quite easy for my 7 year old son  If your looking for a truck that offers a smooth ride than look no further than the F 150  The 4 wheel drive is a must for those who have to drive in inclement weather  No need to get out and  quot lock in the hubs quot  either the F150 changes from 2 wheel to 4 wheel drive with the quick and easy shift of a lever  The 5 4L Triton v 8 offers all the power you will need  Whether you want to tow the boat up to the lake or have to drive up a snow covered hill  the F 150 should be your vehicle of choice br br  
Pos, Hello I love my Ford F 150 supercab  The fourth door in the 99 s was a wonderful idea  I have had three F 150 s and by far this on is my favorite  It is so convenient to be able to go and open the doors from either side  Packing and unpacking is so much better  The only thing I can think of is the noise reduction needs to be worked on  There is alot of noise driving down the highway  I have had it checked out at the dealership and they have told me that is the truck  Nothing is wrong as far as the truck goes  Please make it a more quite ride for people that enjoy cruiseing down the highway listening to there music  Also  the fold down console is not very convenient for your arms  Make the console longer  The fog lights are wonderful  I have been able to get home at night many times with your fog lights  I lived fifty miles out of town in the mountains  There were nights it was snowing so bad  I could not see the road in front of me  The fog lights is what got me home  I wouldn t have a truck without them  If anyone wants a wonderful truck  get yourself a Ford F 150 supercab  You will wonder why you did not do it before now The seats are very comfortable but solid  This makes for a long drive a very pleasant and comfortable drive  Remember  drive a Ford F 150 and you will see what I am talking about     
Pos, The F 150 that I have has been the best truck that I have owned  the comfort level of the seats and the interior is great  It came with the standard installed sound system  that has been superior  The rear opening doors have been a plus  easy in and out and with good latches and seals  The model I have has a 300 cubic inch 6  that has plenty of power  to handle the 4X4 operations  the automatic locking hubs leave a little to be desired  other then that the truck handles and operates with ease  The hub locking  is not what I expected  the thing I don t like is you must travel forward about 10 feet before they lock in  so if you don t lock them in before you start  you could be in trouble  and if you have to back up for any reason  they will unlock  and the whole thing starts over again  Not one of Ford s better Ideas  The manual locking hubs are still the way to go  I bought this truck because Fords are the only trucks I have ever owned  this one makes number 10 br br  
Pos, This is a Vehicle to Love  I bought a 2000 Ford F 150 its terrific it has 4 doors  all the luxury s of a car rides wonderful it has a cd player power windows  abs brakes on all 4 wheels  The cost was  24 000 00 was like a steal  While theres no four wheel drive on this vehicle they do make them I didn t want 4 wheel drive nor did i want a V 8 this truck is a V 6 and still moves great  I had a Dodge Ram before this and it rode just like a truck on the freeways it made me sick to ride in it  so if you want a truck with all the luxury s of a car and the ride of a car this is the truck for you  They are priced well and look great and run terrific  This truck has lots of room for a truck it fits 5 adults comfortably br br  
Pos, All I have to say is if your looking for a Truck the F150 would be a good choice  The F150 that I am telling you about is a 2000 F 150 4x4 Supercab Lariat 139 quot  WB flareside with a 5 4 EFI V8 engine  When I was out comparing trucks I was looking for one that had the power to pass at any given time and the comfort of a car  I compared price and that seemed about the same  The selling points for me was the look  the drive  and the power  This truck rides smooth and doesn t do bad on gas as well  As for the power  it was unmatched  Their are many different styles to choose from as well  Some other selling points would be the compartment between the seats has plenty of room for anything you might want to put in there  Although this truck is sleek  it probably would be a little difficult for some people to get in and out of it     
Pos, When the demands of family life outweigh the number of seats in your regular cab pickup what can you do  TRADE UP  This is my second ford truck  In fact I would say that this is close to my dream truck  My wife and I looked at the Taurus Wagon  the Volvo Wagons  Ford Explorer  Subaru Wagon and a few minivans  Our main goal was to get a roomy car for long trips and to have a second car that could hold two child car seats and two more adults  A secondary issue was replacing my truck which is a 1997 F 150 regular cab  I also wrote review on that truck  My wife was leaning toward the Volvo and I of course wanted more truck After shopping around  I went on a test drive with the salesman  In the middle of the drive I called my wife and we stopped by to get her and my two boys  So  during the test drive we had two large male adults  me and the salesman both 250 lbs  my wife and two car seats with the boys  riding comfortably  My wife was really amazed at the space in the cab  with the bonus of having a truck bed Let me describe my truck  It is a silver 2003 F 150 Supercrew XLT 4x4  4 6 V 8  with the Class III towing package option and ABS all around  It also includes cruise control  AC  17 inch wheels w OWL tires  3 73 rear axle an in dash single CD player  power windows  power locks  power mirrors  fog lights and a Ford bed liner  For all those with kids  there are tether anchors in the rear  During the first week I had the truck  I put approx  1000 miles on it doing my work commute and routine errand running  My initial impression is that Ford really softened the ride so that you don t get that jarring truck feel when going over bumps  No mistaking  it doesn t equal a car s ride  but it rides like a very smooth truck  In addition Ford fixed the issue that I had with my 1997 F 150  by moving the exhaust pipe to exit behind the rear wheel  The rear seats fold down to provide dry storage inside of the cab  It is a split bench in the rear  so I can still fold down 1 3 of the seat and have the two car seats in the back  In the front  you can also ride three adults comfortably  so it really is 6 passenger seating  This car is perfect for our 4 member family and is a great utility for us as homeowners  Before we started our search I thought we would have to forsake the utility of a truck  However the Super Crew  and other four door trucks  covers a lot of bases Some of the other things I have noticed about the truck are that the driver has excellent visibility of the road around him her  This truck has large mirrors and the hood drops away so that the driver can see what is immediately in front of the truck  The factory radio is decent but is easily drowned out when you have the windows down  The over head console has a compass and outside temperature  but no other information  I would like to see maybe distance to empty  gas mileage etc  The electronic odometer has a trip computer  The gauges on the truck show speed  tachometer  oil pressure  system charge  coolant temperature  The middle seat in the front folds down to be a storage compartment and has two cup holders  There are also two cup holders in the rear  I also have two outlets in the front  radar detector and cell phone  and an outlet in the rear located in the seatbelt anchor  This outlet in the back is perfect for cell phones and laptops  My wife likes the under seat storage in the rear also  Behind the rear seats are storage compartments and one of them holds the jack and tire iron for the truck  The truck came with floor mats and treated upholstery  something similar to scotch guard So far the drawbacks are pretty standard  The gas mileage is an issue but is to be expected with a large truck that is V 8 powered  The other issue is that the brakes  while adequate  feel a little mushy  The 4 6 V 8 also only rates in my opinion as adequate  I have learned not to drive a truck like a car  so this isn t a big issue to me  The tires that came with the truck are Goodyear Wranglers  I don t have any complaints so far on the tires  but I like the Dunlop Rover LT s which are excellent in the rain  I will let you know how the Wrangler s do b 2500 Mile Update b This truck has done pretty well during the break in period  One minor issue is the adjustable pedals  gas   brake  there is a switch on the dash for moving them and it is NOT deactivated while the truck is in motion  I sometimes nudge the buttons with my knee  Towing  I towed a 88 Ford Crown Victoria to the auction  on an auto transport trailer   30 miles  The 4 6 V 8 was adequate task but could really use more power when towing something that large  like the 5 4L v 8  With the overdrive disabled  the truck would really lug going up hills with the added weight  Other than that the engine is more than adequate for family hauling and highway cruising  I was able to 4x4 with a full load of wood with no problem in wet muddy terrain  With regards to gas mileage   I monitor with trip computer and gas receipts  I am getting 17 mpg on highway and 14 in the city  My initial mileage  first 1000 miles  was around 14Hwy 12City   If we can put a man on the moon  we can make a light duty  4x4  V 8  funtional truck that gets 18 MPG city and 22 MPG HWY Family Duty is where the truck really shines  Trips to Sam s Club with the family are a breeze with plenty of room for bulk paper towels  bulk food and other gargantuan grocery list items         At highway speeds the truck has very little wind noise in the cabin  compared to my 97 truck  Also when the truck has a few hundred pounds in the bed and 4 5 people in the cab  it rides like a luxury car  When the bed is empty and you are by yourself  prepare to bounce over every bump  price you pay for HD suspension and having a truck  All in all I am very satisfied with my purchase at this point  My wife also really likes the truck now  We have to fight for the keys  She feels very comfortable driving it  good visibility  she likes the functional privacy glass in the rear to keep sun off the kids  the child locks in the rear are a plus and so far her only issue is getting used to climbing up into the truck  
Pos,  This is our nickname for our Ford Expedition  why you say  Because it is such a huge  beast of a truck We first purchased the Eddie Bauer version of the Ford Explorer  last summer  because I was rapidly outgrowing my Ford Explorer  With two kids  car seats  baby strollers and expensive makeup cases to haul around  we decided it was time to expand We had always wanted an Expedition and searched high and low until we found the exact one we were looking for   a black one with a sun roof  It s like a taste of freedom to open that roof and the closest thing I ll get to a convertible  We just needed more room for our family and this is the perfect vehicle if that s what you are looking for  too  It has a third seat in the back of the truck that can also fold down flat or you can remove it altogether Gripe 1  However  you must be very strong to both remove and or fold the seat down  I have found it impossible to do this as a woman weighing 112 pounds  My husband even has a hard time with the seat removal so a lot of the time we just keep it flat  My oldest son is six and he had so much fun riding in the third seat  but I found it to be unsafe back there  I am a big believer in booster seats for kids and that is not the place for him  And  once all three seats are up  there is almost no room for storage at all   Gripe 2  So now that you know how much I weigh  let me tell you how tall I am now  5 5  Why  you say  Well this is my problem with this vehicle Gripe  3  I am just too small to see behind me  especially when I am backing up  The front seats are high  bucket seats which I think are an obstacle  I am thoroughly convinced this is a MAN S truck and not made for women  even though I see more moms driving them  I even tried sitting on an elevated foam pad but that made it even more difficult Since purchasing this vehicle  the price of gasoline has gone up daily   Gripe 4  Can you say  GAS GUZZLER To fill up THE BEAST  It costs  40 00  at least  So part of the proceeds of this review will get me a gallon of gas If you live or work in a building with a parking garage  better check the height allowances   Gripe 5  because this bad boy needs clearance of 6 6  I ve scraped many a garage roof  And let s not forget about parking   Gripe 6  Parking spaces are meant for cars  not trucks  It is ALWAYS a tight squeeze to get into those spaces at the malls and once you get in to the spot  getting out of your car is a whole new issue  You must be thin as you try and squeeze yourself out between the cars  So what do I like about THE BEAST  you say  Three words  FOUR WHEEL DRIVE  LOVE IT  It has never let me down and that s worth it s weight in gold  I also feel very safe in this vehicle and absolutely hate riding in cars now  THE BEAST sits high and proud  and it s V8 engine can really take off All in all  this has been an excellent truck  very dependable and spacious  But I m thinking about trading it in for a slightly smaller truck  I have become convinced that it is not the most comfortable car to drive and it is just too big for me  I take a lot of flack from men that I work with about driving such a monster truck  Most of them are very envious of THE BEAST   everyone has something to say about it  It s kind of like BEAST envy  This is definitely a macho truck and well worth every penny So soon I may have to part with THE BEAST  parting will be such sweet sorrow  But  rest assured  my next one will also be black  four wheel drive and a sun roof  too  it just will have a girlier nick name  like  BEAUTY    hmmm The search is on anyone wanna buy a slightly used BEAST  
Pos, I ve driven Fords since I got my Mustang when I was 16  From there  I bought a Cougar  then an Explorer  I now drive an Eddie Bauer Expedition  I guess the one common denominator with all my Fords is the awesome air conditioner  Living in Texas  with our summers  air conditioning is very important and I believe they get a good testing here when the temperature reaches over 100 for days in a row  To make matters more interesting  my current Expedition is black  While driving home from visiting relatives several months ago  I blew up the engine in my Expedition  I had just had the oil changed that morning  I crept into the nearest Ford dealership in Mineral Wells Texas and was given the bad news  Ford paid for all but  1000 of the new engine and most of my rental car for the next 3 weeks  What happened to the engine  I do not know  Did Ford handle the problem correctly  I don t know  The interior of the Expedition has met all my expectations  There is ample leg room in the second seat for adults as well as children  Behind the back seat is enough space for groceries without moving the third seat at all  With the third seat folded down  I have been able to tote anything I have need to  even with 5 kids and a dog  Golf clubs  trips to Sams  camping trips  etc  have all been accomplished without me ever having to take out the seat  The radio and CD player have been fine with good sound and easy to manipulate knobs and buttons  The handle in the back seat that hangs from the ceiling has gotten loose  and the clothes hook has come off on one side  Otherwise I have had no interior problems at all  I know that the car runs well  however  my prized possession  the great air conditioning  is not the same  It takes almost an hour to get the ice cold air I used to have immediatly  I have plenty of freon  and no one knows the problem  I will be getting a new car in the next 6 months or so and I probably will not be buying another Ford  Not because of anything except I guess at 36 years old I should drive something else so I can have a reference to compare it with     
Pos, The Ford Expedition is a wonderful SUV  The Expedition that I have the pleasure of owning is a 1998 Eddie Bauer edition with a 5 4 liter engine  The engine is more than capable of pulling the Expeditions weight plus another four or five thousand pounds of trailer  I have used the vehicle to pull a 22 foot sport boat to Arkansas and the truck did well in the hills of the Ozark Mountains  Stopping power with a trailer is also very good though added distance is needed of course  The 5 4 is also a very capable engine option in the mountains of Colorado  The truck moves well with the automobiles of lesser weight and ascends quickly up the steep inclines  Though 20  of a vehicles power is lost in the mountains the Expedition had power to spare  The Expedition does exceptionally well in the snow  I have four wheeled in about 8 inches of snow and could not get the vehicle stuck in drifts or otherwise  The vehicle is equipped with part time four wheel drive which allows it to be driven on dry roads with four wheel engaged  The truck senses wheel spin and puts it in four wheel drive only when needed  Full time and four low can also be selected with the flip of a switch which lock the four wheels in drive mode The Expedition has been a trouble free automobile for the past 30  000 miles  It has been to the dealership only to look at new Expeditions that I will definitely purchase when the lease expires  The lease that Ford offered has been trouble free and was explained well when I purchased the vehicle from Woodhouse Ford in Blair Nebraska  If you are hauling many people i e  8  then the rear seat is worth the  300 option price  However if you do not need it the seat is more of a hassle  When you wish to haul large objects in the back the seat leaves you with only one to two feet of cargo space when installed  The seat is however easy to remove with two people at each side  Also if you plan to buy a lot of groceries with the seat installed plan on putting them in the back seat or picking up your canned goods that fall all over when placed on top of the folded seat back  The truck has only needed routine maintenance such as oil changes and windshield wiper fluid  The oil is extremely easy to change for the do it yourselfer because the oil pick up and filter are separate from the engine block  The filter is located right up front and is vertically placed so no oil drips out when unscrewing the filter  Spark plugs on the overhead cam 5 4 engine last until 100 000 miles so I am not able to comment on changing those  however they look difficult to reach because the engine is recessed in its bay  The leather on the seats has held up well to wet swimsuits and dirty jeans  It cleans easily with a little leather cleaner  The only bad thing that I can comment on the vehicle is that it was not equipped with an outside temperature gauge  which is nice if the roads get slick and you want to see if it is freezing  It does however have an electronic distance to empty and compass gauge  The truck provides a commanding view of the road and is obstructed only by semi trucks and other trucks of that nature Plan on spending about  30 to fill the tank from empty at  1 20 per gallon gas prices  The 5 4 goes through the gas rather quickly getting about 300 350 miles from a full tank     
Pos, When we were faced with buying a bigger vehicle suitable for transporting more people  my husband wouldn t consider anything other than an Expedition  He s wanted one since they came out in 1997  His wish finally came true  In late February  2000  we bought a 98 Eddie Bauer I m trying to  I really want to like it but I m going to tell you about our experiences in the 2 shorts months we ve had it  I hope this isn t an indication of what s to come Our timing could have been better in buying this vehicle  We found it bought it on a Saturday and the interest rates went up the previous Monday  Need I mention the price of gas  Okay both of these are nobody s fault I ll start with the positive  The main thing I like is it gives you a commanding view of the road sitting up so high  I LOVE the fact that the doors automatically lock when put in gear  Since I have small children  I appreciate the child proof lock option I do not think it s hard to maneuver but I am used to big cars The temperature controls and radio controls for the back are nice A neutral point small children or shorter adults are the only ones comfortable in the third seat  The middle back is very roomy and comfortable  The back  quot hatch quot  if you will  is kind of hard and heavy to put down Observation the further back you sit  the bouncier it gets Now for our negative experiences  First  the third seat didn t come out as easily as we were told or as the owner s manual indicated  My husband ended up having to use some tools to undo something  I don t know  I wasn t here when he did it I wish there was more room behind the third seat and the door We hadn t had this vehicle for 2 weeks when I put the back window  right back door  down and it wouldn t go back up  We live 3 hours from the dealership where we bought it  We got it fixed locally and they reimbursed us Two weeks later  on a Monday  I m on my way home from taking kids to preschool when the  quot check engine quot  light came on  I couldn t get it in to the local shop until Wednesday   60 later we found out that my husband didn t put the gas cap on properly after getting gas  Since the gas cap wasn t on correctly  it was emitting illegal emissions  thus triggering the  quot check engine quot  light  The only way they can figure this out is by hooking it up to their computer wherein they get the error code  Even if we knew the gas cap wasn t on properly upon seeing the  quot check engine quot  light  the mechanic told me that it would not automatically go off once it had been tripped  it had to be reset by a mechanic  Okay  so why doesn t Ford put a  quot gas cap quot  warning light on your dash or something instead of having to go through all of this  I let my husband get gas once in the fourteen years we ve been married and he can t even do that right  I ve taken his keys away So this vehicle has made two trips to the shop before we made our first payment  I m not sure how to answer the reliability question since we haven t owned it all that long and the two trips to the shop haven t really been engine related When I have a full vehicle while making the  quot preschool run quot  I feel like a bus  That s what the kids call it and the teacher commented that it was a pretty nice bus  I ve never ridden on a school bus as nice     
Pos, We traded in our Ford Explorer on an 1998 Eddie Bauer Expedition and it was the best choice we have made by far  The cabin is roomy  the seats comfortable and easy to clean when the little ones get them dirty and feels like you re riding on air  I do wish we had a more current model  since now the foot pedals on the 2000 models adjust to peoples height  as I am 5 4 quot  I would like that little perk  This SUV turns on a dime  which is great compared to the Crew Cab Ford Pickup we used to own  Much easier to handle in those parking lots at the mall  amp  grocery store  In addition  I didn t know that there was airbag suspension we bought the Expedition  but there is  and it makes it a much more comfortable ride compared to that jolty Explorer  I would recommend this vehicle to a family of three to seven  and the smaller the family  the better for a roadtrip  We just take out the third seat and pile up the back with our stuff  I highly recommend this one br br  
Pos, I really love the Ford Expedition  I ve had it a year now and it still drives like it did when I first bought it  I used to own an Acura Integra but after having two children  we needed a more spacious vehicle  The Ford Explorer was the most popular at the time but the Expedition caught our eye because of its size and luxury look  It looked like more than just a truck  We got the leather interiors  chrome accents and running boards and it sure looks great  The kids love it because we can take all their friends along and they also have  quot kid room quot  The far back seat is fun for them cause it has a little bounce to it My husband has found the vehicle useful for his new Disc Jockey business  He just pops out the third row seat and his equipment fits nicely in the back  I love how it rides and turns  It rides just like a car and handles really well  The only problem we ve had with the vehicle was an oil leak  The dealer was really great about getting it fixed right away  We re back to smooth sailing again We also took it on a west coast vacation trip from Southern California to Northern California  We ll never take a road trip in a little car again  You ride up high  you re in control of the road  It s great family fun br br  
Pos, After owning 3 Ford Explorers we decided to order a new 98 Expedition in the Fall of 97  We ordered a 4x2 w  leather  6pack CD  4 6L engine and without rear seat or towing pkg  We also purchased the extended 6 yr  100 000 mile warranty  We have traveled extensively in this car since then  Putting over 50 000 miles on it  Total repairs have been to replace the front brakes at 36 000 and the rears at 50 000 miles  Other than that we have changed the engine oil every 4 000 miles and the transmission at 36 000 miles  The original tires are still doing well  having rotated them every other oil change  They look like they have at least another 15 000 safe miles  NO other problems  Fuel mileage on trips averages 21  MPG  around town about 15 or so  I m satisfied in every way with this car and would recommend one to just about anyone that wants this type of automobile  The only down side is that it won t fit in all parking garages  We have found a couple where the roof rack will hit  I have found it an easy matter to remove the roof rack if I am going to be exposed to this situation  The car is a very smooth and stable vehicle on the road  It will cruise 80 miles per hour all day with no effort  When you get out of the comfortable leather bucket seats after a 10 hour run you are not totaled  as you are in some cars  We really enjoy it  Another plus is the visibility  my wife enjoys the safety afforded by this and the size of the unit  If you are in a wreck you will probably be safer than in a smaller car     
Pos, I just cannot say enough about the Ford Expedition  I have owned one for the past two years and have been extremely happy with this vehicle  I have taken the family to Myrtle beach on two separate occasion in this vehicle and the drive was pleasurable  My wife particularly loves the vehicle because she feels secure behind the wheel  It is a very safe vehicle and extremely reliable in any type of weather  During the Labor Day storm we had in the northeast  my wife was out shopping and got caught in the store during the storm  The power went out in the store and the customers were told that the store was closing  Outside there was a number of trees and power lines down  My wife was very confident that this vehicle would get her home safely and that is what it did  There isn t a driving situation that this vehicle will not overcome  This vehicle is for everybody especially for a large family lots of room  Love it     
Pos, Dear Prosepctive Car Buyer We just got our Ford Expedition 1 year ago and we just love it  At first we had the next best thing  a Ford Explorer  and that was the tops  Now  we have the Ford Expedition and we just live in it  We have a Huge Triton V8 5 4 litre  This is just a monster  We can pull boats  trailers  mobile homes  You name it and the Ford Expedition can take it on  With just the right amount of space inside  this Ford Expedition does not even compare to the GMC Sonoma or the GMC Suburban   Other cars we had considered when purchasing the Expedition  Ford has such an excellent reputation and it sure lives up with this  Only in the shop for an oil change  it really lives up to standard From torque  to comfort and from luxury to power  the Ford Expedition blows away all other competitors Thanks for reading my article write up     
Pos, As soon as I saw this SUV I fell in love and I knew no matter how long it would take me to save the money for this beast  I had to have it  For one  it s truly a luxury vehicle  it has all the luxury options of a Lexus or BMW in a truck  It was when I drove it though that my love turned into lust and I couldn t get enough  I went to different dealerships every couple of weeks to  quot test drive quot  it  more like get my fix There are some things I d suggest getting on an Expedition 3rd seat  it s light and easy to remove and you ll be thankful if you ever need to take 7 other people somewhere Rear Air  those 7 other people will be thankful if you have it I enjoy the 6 disc CD changer  it s great for the music lover and you commuter s out there I think the Expedition looks a heck of a lot meaner with the 17 inch rims which in turn require the illuminated running boards  and last but definitely not least  do not  I repeat do not let any salesperson talk you out of the 5 4 liter engine  It s like the difference between a Ford Escort and a Mustang  No matter what other options you give up  get the larger engine br br  
Pos, For 10 years I owned a Jeep Wrangler and I loved everything about it  Then I got married and we had twins a couple of years later  Well  the old Jeep wasn t gonna hold all the baby things that come along with the babies  so we went looking for something else  It seemed to me that the choices were a mini van or an SUV  I just couldn t go from a Jeep to a mini van  There would have been way to much therapy involved  As we looked at the SUV s on the market I noticed that the Ford Explorer  and others like it  were nothing more than a large sedan with a really tall trunk  We would still have to take two vehicles if we wanted to go somewhere with our kids and other friends and family  The Expedition provided just the right mix  It holds all our kids stuff  is easy to get in and out of  handles extremely well  this baby will turn on a dime  and still allows us to take our kids and our folks out to dinner in the same vehicle  I have taken it off road on many occasions and have only minor complaints about its abilities there  It s easy enough for my little wife to drive and it fits into my garage  A fairly amazing feat with the size of garages being built these days  but that s for another review  Bottom line is it is easy to drive  holds lots of stuff  and fits in the garage  Sure the gas mileage really blows  but it s a small sacrifice for the comfort I get  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who needs space  comfort  reliability and something more manly than a mini van br br  
Pos, I purchased a used Ford Expedition in late 1999 when my job begin requiring me to go to remote radio tower repeater sites in the Ozarks The Expedition was simply the most comfortable vehicle I have ever owned  I felt very safe and secure with nearly 3 tons of metal around me  the 4 wheel drive relieved me of hiking into remote sites carrying 75 or so pounds of radio test equipment I thoroughly researched available SUVs before I made the plunge  and the Expedition was the only one which met all of the criteria for my uses The only problem I have had has been a small hole was worn in a  T  fitting on the engine resulting in a check engine light and rough idle  About  45 dollars at the deal fixed it I will probably be getting rid of it soon as my job duties have changed once again  and I no longer need the 4 WD  and I am driving farther to work  The Expedition has the 5 4 engine with the trailer towing package and only gets about 13 14 MPG on the highway  I will most definitely miss it  but it s running me nearly  40 week for gasoline  
Pos, I ve been a proud owner of a 1966 Mustang convertible for five years  It is one of the best cars I have ever driven  I recently watched a TV program where they investigated the exploding gas tanks in 1960 s mustangs  I think it is not as big of a deal as they make it out to be  In this TV report  they blamed Ford Motor Company for the deaths of several teen age mustang drivers  In these accidents  when the mustangs were rear ended  the gas tanks were punctured causing gas to get all over the driver and burn them  The gas entered the car because of the fold down back seat  I know that in my convertible  there is no possible way for anything to get from the trunk to the back seat  Only fastbacks have this fold down seat  Ford shouldn t be blamed for any of this  If you own a car from the 1960 s you should know that it isn t going to be that safe  When compared with other old car problems  this seems to be very small  I suggest that if you do own a 60 s mustang with this problem you buy a metal barrier so that gas cannot enter the car  You can get one in any mustang restoration catalog for about  200  It is a very good investment to make  If you own an old car  you should be responsible and make sure it is safe  Classic mustangs are the best cars ever and they don t need a minor flaw like this messing up their reputation     
Pos, I got this truck new and it took all my money but it was worth it since it s a keeper  I thought it was a bust at first because it kept going into 4 wheel drive for no reason but I just called the Ford assistance line and they sent a tow truck out  It turned out that the factory had left an extra spring shackle wedged in the front end somewhere which would rub on the front axle when you turned causing the automatic hubs to engage  Anyway  they fixed it for free  There was a problem with the rivets on the frame but they fixed that for free too  The only thing they don t fix for free is the automatic hubs which went out once on me  I figure they need fixing once every three years which is better than getting out to lock them manually  I didn t like how low the truck sat so I got a 4  lift  big tires  and this reverse shackle thing on the front which makes it ride better on the freeway where it s all rippled  It s an animal on the ranches  goes up anything  even when the roads are washed out  Once  I dropped the right rear in a ditch and the left front was in the air and I had to pull it out with the dozer but that s the only time it got stuck  It s got this turbo charged  power stroke diesel which will out accelerate the 460 gas version here in California  Some people don t like it making a lot of noise but I don t care  I live in the country  
Pos, Go Big Red is what our F150 seems to shout to everyone who looks on  This flashy red truck with a V 6 and 5 speed manual transmission seems to have enough power for me and can spin tires without even trying  We purchased her recently from   Jim s Dodge Country   located at 5402 L St  in Omaha  The salesperson was originally asking  12 600  but we were able to negotiate down to  10 800  which was the bottom of the range that  First National Bank of Omaha   quoted us for a loan  I will discuss financing possibilities later in the review  We bought this truck to go back and forth to work and for camping  note my camping reviews  We do not intend to tow anything such as a boat b  Positives   Some of the features that we enjoy are  wide seating  enough for 3 adults in the front seat  heater that heats up quickly within the first mile in 12 degree weather  after a 2 minute warm up  reliable starting in cold weather  long  wide bed for camping  relatively smooth QUIET ride  unlike my Mazda B2000  22 000 miles with 14 000 miles and 6 months left on the warranty  There are also gauges on the dash  including  temperature  oil  charging and fuel  The dome light turns on automatically along with a couple of auxiliary lights  in the same compartment  behind the driver s seat  There are four speakers in the cab  giving a luxurious sound and GREAT separation  There is a dual cup holder which pops out of the dash  just above the ashtray  This cupholder holds a 20 ounce soda perfectly  There is a dual cigarette lighter  perhaps one for lighting cigarettes and the other for power toys such as a TV  cell phone charger or auxiliary defroster  If you should not shut your door properly  a light comes on to tell you that your door is ajar  This truck features a 30 gallon gas tank  with 15 mpg city and 17 mpg highway  as stated on the original window tag Also  I have found that this vehicle has more leg room than my Mazda did  I normally would drive the Mazda with the seat all the way back  even though many mechanics would move it up  I have found that I can drive comfortably with the seat moved forward about 4 inches  There is plenty of room in back of the seat  which is split  60 40  and carpeted on the back  There is ample storage in back of the seat  in case I wish to keep store purchases out of view  The dash is deep  about an arm s length  which I guess is neither here nor there  but perhaps worth mentioning  There are also pockets on each door  which would be handy for maps  coupon books  etc  There is also a compartment near the steering wheel for one to put small items in  The glove box is wide  but not very deep  One can see the traffic up ahead as this vehicle sits higher than most other vehicles  This vehicle has dual mirrors  the passenger side one is slightly convex b  Negatives   Some of the drawbacks  the bed in this full sized 2 wheel drive pickup is TALL  It can be difficult to reach items that you put in the box  It will be difficult to scrape ice off the windshield in the middle of winter  Also  I tend to hold the steering wheel by the horizontal bar that the horn is on  while driving  This is wider in this vehicle than in the Mazda that I am used to driving  My large hands barely fit  a smaller woman probably wouldn t be able to use this gripping method  as the airbag is contained within  Speaking of airbags  there is a place to turn off the passenger airbag  It may take a key  as I see a key slot  as well as a button  I will need to investigate this  however we have no small children in our household  The vehicle itself is wider than I am normally used to driving  I am unsure about fine points of parking this larger vehicle  The key can be awkward to turn off  as there is an extra lever which needs to be turned off  but perhaps it is this way in all Fords                                                         3 10 01 OK  not even one month later  I am discovering that the heater control switch  the dial which switches the air from hot to cold is not functioning properly   Sometimes  you have to turn the knob back and forth to get the warm air to properly fill the cab  It can force you out when it is zero degrees out  or feel lukewarm when it is 30 degrees out  Guess they ll have to replace the switch  Being too hot is not a problem  being too cool is  Seems it only happens SOMETIMES  but not when it is in the shop As well  as I was stopping at a stop light this afternoon  the check engine light came on  The owner s manual said this could be because I was out of gas  had water in the tank or a couple of other variables including emissions problems  Wasn t running choppy at all  I turned the engine off and back on and it was still there  Could this be a Fix Or Repair Daily  I hope things don t go wrong this regularly when the warranty expires in a few months  When I took it in for warranty work  they noted that a bad oxygen sensor needed replacing  which they did  free of charge  As well  the hazard lights do not always work properly  and sometimes only one out of four lights blink                                                           7 29 01 I took the Ford in earlier this week because the overhead light did not come on consistently when I opened the drivers  door  They replaced the switch free of charge  one month left on the warranty Also  I noted that when I drove home during a 3 hour trip on a very humid day  there was a bit of condensation coming off the air conditioning unit placed above my sandal clad feet  The water was not excessive  but noticeable upon my nearly bare feet  nonetheless                                                             05 12 02 Things seem to have gone well with this truck and we just put on 2 000 miles on a one week trip  The truck handled well on the rainy streets  It can burn rubber easily when backing up a wet hill  however I back into my driveway  which is on a hill  If I park on the hill  rather than the base of the hill  I can occasionally hear the truck creeking backward  My husband has successfully parked half way up the hill when encouraging the sun to melt the snow in the winter time Occasionally the passenger seatbelt will make a ratcheting sound  It works  but the sound is annoying 11 02 The starter is starting to go out  It is not releasing  retracting or whatever it is supposed to do  We have 50 000 miles on it  The cost of a replacement  lifetime warranty  was  250  Our average distance driven one way to work is 10 miles  We also run errands with this truck  It is also used for pleasure and long distance trips 1 2 times a year 7 03 I was shifting gears quickly to change lanes in heavy traffic  That is when the manual gearshifter knob came off in my hand  I suppose it could have caused an accident  Mileage  60 000  Replacement gear shift knob  approximately  14 7 03 We have about 61 000 miles on the truck  I was driving along perfectly well  I stopped for a minute and attempted to restart the truck  It kept turning over  but never started  When I did coax it to start  it ran VERY rough  and I was scared to drive it  Seems the FUEL PUMP went out  Bill 360  We had a range of  290 from a private garage to over  400 at the dealer  The fuel pump is located by the fuel tank and one needs to take off the fuel tank to gain access The hood may be made from aluminum or plastic as it will not hold a magnet  Unsure of the gauge of tin used elsewhere on the body What I REALLY like  is the warning bell when you ve left your headlights on  The pockets alongside the doors are handy for maps  etc  I like the mini storage behind the seats b Criteria  Before I took delivery of this vehicle  I wanted to see what it was worth  We both looked in the classifieds and online  We called my bank   First National Bank of Omaha    and they said they would loan anywhere from  10 800 to  14 000 or so for this vehicle  I inquired as to financing and they quoted us 9 1  with my excellent credit  I also checked with my insurance company   State Farm   who quoted us 8 25 on a 60 month loan  The dealer   Jim s Dodge Country    went through  Commercial Federal  and was able to get us a 8 1  loan  when a day earlier he quoted us a loan rate somewhere in the high 8  range for persons with good credit Another criteria that I had was to have my mechanic    Keith Pauley    owner of   All Pro Muffler and Brakes    located at 4646 S  60 St  Omaha  Nebraska  do a free mechanical inspection before the deal was finalized  We have been doing business with Keith ever since he opened about 5 years ago  We went in there to have our brakes replaced on our Chevette  only to have him tell us that all they needed was a free adjustment  He has had our business ever since  Keith informed us that the parking brake did not hold on our new Ford when it was on a hill  and the brake light on the dash had a short and suggested that we have this fixed at  H P  Smith Ford   as it was still under warranty  He also advised that the tires needed replacing    All Pro   specializes in brake and muffler repair service  Other than brakes and mufflers  Keith s customers have demanded that he go into virtually all kinds of mechanical repairs  He is a straightforward person and will tell you the way it is  being nice in the process We asked the salesperson at   Jim s Dodge Country   to see if he could get us a good deal on tires  He called a nearby company    T O  Hass Tires   located at 5120 L St  who made us a good deal  We also went to  H P  Smith Ford   located at 5051 L St  who very agreeably set up service for the items still under warranty  He even informed us that the warranty was 5 months longer than the salesman originally told us  Also  the salesman mentioned that there were no recalls on this particular vehicle Speaking of seats  I work the night shift  I make it a habit to take my lunch sleeping in the cab of this vehicle  It is very easy to throw your legs over the bench seat  rest your head on the driver window  and take a nap  Taking a nap in our Mazda pickup cab is a chore compared to this All in all  we are very pleased with our purchase  If things change  you will be the second folks to know   FYI  We used to have a Ford F250  1981  which was a Fix Or Repair Daily However  the truck was a 3 owner  high mileage truck with a strong 460 V 8   my husband adds For some odd reason  my husband wanted to buy another Ford  Hopefully we will have better luck with this one  
Pos, OVERVIEW I ve been a Ford man my entire life  They truly are the best made automobiles in the world  Anyway  the 2 door Explorer Sport is definitely my favorite  It s an all around great looking vehicle  and I always get tons of compliments about it LIKES I am very particular about my vehicles  and the Explorer still met all my needs  Leather seats  power seats and windows  moon sun roof  cd tape radio deck  thermometer compass  and rear temp and stereo controls are all the great options I got  I think it is very smooth riding  even for a SUV  While its only built for four adults comfortably  five can still fit  except you are short a seatbelt  DISLIKES There are not many things I do not like about the Explorer Sport  I do wish it had the on board computer that 4 door Explorer Limited and Eddie Bauer have  Its just nice to know exactly how much gas you have left  your mileage  and instantly know your systems diagnosis of potential problems  all of which the inboard computer provides DRIVING Driving the Explorer Sport is awesome  In late April of 2000 I was at an overnight camping party  No tent needed  just fold down the back seats and throw a sleeping bag back there  Well overnight it started pouring and never stopped  We were at the end of the muddiest minimum maintenance road I ve ever seen  While everyone else got there cars trucks stuck on this muddy road  I flipped into 4 Wheel Drive Low and drove through a muddy cornfield for 5 miles  It was great The Explorer drives well in any conditions  I especially likes it 4 wheel drive handling  It is just great WHO SHOULD SHOULD NOT BUY I really don t think you can go wrong with the Explorer Sport  Since there are only two doors  dealing with little children and child seats  is probably not suggested  But for singles  a young married couple  an extra work pleasure auto  or even a truck replacement this is a perfect vehicle br br  
Pos, To all of those who dislike their SUV s  think again  This is finally a truck that lives up to the term SUV  After owning many cars  and not having any luck  I finally found a vehicle that is dependable  This is my second Explorer  and I love it  I purchased this one 4 months ago  and have only minor complaints  The only problems that I have had were paint related  and that was the dealers fault  Seems they scratched it when prepping the car for delivery  I feel that the value of this vehicle is better than average  The reliability is better than I have seen with other SUV s  I traded in my Pontiac Grand Prix Early and am completely satisfied  I have been reading a lot of other people s reviews  and am a bit confused  I am reading about how uncomfortable  or how bumby  or how much this car uses gas  well just a few questions  This is a truck right  It is not supposed to be a car  correct  Knowing this why did you buy it if you are going to complain  There are a few things you should know about this truck before buying it  It is bumpier than a car  it does not get 25 30 miles to the gallon  and it will not do 0 60 in under 8 seconds  but then again  get the right setup and you can pull just about anything  drive through or over pretty much all that gets in your way  and feel confident that you have lots of vehicle around you  The only major complaint I have is that it does rattle a little  However I knew that going in to it  That is what a truck does  As I see it  you pay for the power  and ability  All I can say for the skeptics is  if you are looking for a well built  reasonably priced truck  this is it  If you want comfort  room  and gas mileage  buy a bigger truck  or get a luxury car  cause this aint it     
Pos, Ford Explorer Sport provides a perfect blend between sport utility capability and practicality for everyday use  While smaller SUVs lack the weight  size  and 4wd ability  larger SUVs sacrifice fuel economy and drivability  For instance  a Honda CRV is not nearly as well suited for rough terrain and or snow  With a structure that is derived from the Honda Civic economy car  it is nowhere near as durable and imposing towards bad weather  On the other hand  a larger SUV  such as a Ford Expedition  or even a 4 door Chevy Blazer for that matter can make a driver feel disconnected to the road and make one nervous when trying to maneuver these battletanks around crowded city streets  With the back end somewhat shortened over 4 door models  one might expect a significant problem with cargo space  This is not the case  Explorer Sport has plenty of space to hold several pairs of skis with the rear seats folded down  Also  visibility is a strong point of Explorer Sport  Pillars are arranged in a manner that cuts down of blind spots fairly well  The Ford Explorer Sport offers a great deal of strong points  not the least of them value  About the only complaint that I have with this car that offers incredible build quality is that the base motor is uninspiring  Go with the 4 0 SOHC as opposed to the OHV model  The extra 30 horses is a definite plus  particularly if towing is in your plans  All in all  though  I have nothing but praise for this well built  capable truck that offers a great blend of four wheel drive ability and normal day drivability br br  
Pos, In September I purchased my Ford Explorer Sport 2000 model  At first all was well but once we went in for our 8000 oil change everything went straight down the drain  Several days later we heard a knock in the engine while the car was in park  I quickly called the service department and told them what was happening with the vehicle  After having my car for 2 days it was decided that Ford was indeed responsible for this defect   although no one wanted to call it that legally  but indeed it was  Apparently   some of these models made for the 2000 year have a high incidence of carbon forming around the pistons and can and will if not taken care of completely ruin your engine  The catch  no one knows how often to have this problem serviced and how to keep the so called wolves at bay because it is a new problem  No one knows anything about it but this new problem can lead to disaster after time even with the routine maintainance Ford prescribes  No one would guarentee that my engine would not blow up   nor could I even get as much as a report to the engineers about this problem because Ford doesnt consider it to be a defective engine   or the inner workings thereof  No one concerning this product is willing to take responsibility for it  nor are they willing to replace the engine ect because Ford doesnt want to admit fault with their product   at least not just yet I am basically driving a time bomb   and I would suggest to look for another vehicle to purchase because it is becoming clear that Ford Motor Corporation doesnt stand behind their product as well as it should  F O R D  Fix Or Repair Daily  br br  
Pos, My husband bought me a Ford Explorer Sport for Christmas last year  and told me that it was going to be our family I was so excited to have a Ford Explorer Sport  The prices do very depending on the options you get I have seen prices as low as 17 000 00 and as high as 25 000 00 Our SUV was priced at 21 500 00  I was disappointed because it seems like we got nothing for it Our SUV is pretty simple All it has is power windows and power door locks I really wish it came with an alarm  What I have discovered over the year is that it is a good car to have Its very dependable on and off road I was staying with my parents and where they live theres a lot of dirt roads This SUV can handle sand  clay  and rocks  I usually would drive about sixty on these dirt roads and it drove great It rides bumpy on the dirt roads and very smooth on the paved streets  Off road lovers will love this car  The SUV is pretty roomy It would be ideal for a family with child that don t have to ride in a car seat As I found out it is difficult to install a infant carrier and remove it as needed  For that reason I wish I had A Ford Explorer Besides that its really roomy  As for gas mileage mine gets roughly 288 to 295 miles per tank A tank holds roughly 17 gallons  I feel that s a lot of gas for those mileage  I do suggest that couples with babies consider the Explorer 4 door instead of the 2 door sport For couples with no children and children that don t need car seats would be a good buy     
Pos, We recently bought a 2001 Ford Explorer  used with only 3500 miles on it  It has the leather package  AM FM CD and Cassette  upgraded speakers  and power everything  Yet after all this negative hype from the media  we still wanted to purchase it  We love it just as much we thought we would  Compared to the Chevy Blazer which we also test drove extensively  the Ford was the best bet for the money  Although we paid  3000 more than we would have paid for the Chevy  the Ford came with options that made it well worth it  The interior is very roomy  and since we re starting a family  we needed the back seat which ample adult seating and leg room  The leather makes it nice because it s easy to keep clean and since I m a little short  I can slide right in once I hop up high enough  It hardly feels  too big  to drive and it s very easy to park  I love it  
Pos, Confession  I am a former member of the  I hate SUV  club  But  having three large dogs  a seven year old  a 19 foot boat that I trailer  a wife who does arts and crafts shows  as well as living in New Hampshire  I had to revoke my membership and take the plunge for what made sense   an SUV  I had driven an older 4 door Explorer and a 2000 Blazer  Both seemed cushy  had roll and lean when cornering and lacked any type of road confidence  I test drove the 01 Sport and was very impressed  The 01 Sport  it has more than adequate power  There are no rattles  which my 95 Taurus wagon specialized in  The vehicle seems solidly built  I love being so high up  Also  the vehicle drives with confidence  steering is responsive and it corners better than any truck I have been in  no roll or lean   Beware of overconfidence  The sound system is the best I have ever had in a vehicle  You do feel every bump on the road  and be careful of taking a corner above 45 where there are noticeable bumps in the road  But remember  this is a Truck  not a car  The ride is quite and on a flat surface  very comfortable  as are the FRONT seats  Mileage is around 19 all round  but this is a big 4 0 engine and not all that bad for its class  Oh yes  towing  I can t tell you how many times I could not haul my boat out due to low tides   Yes  I previously towed with a Taurus Wagon  which probably hastened its premature death  This truck is an awesome tower  It does not cease to amaze me how well this truck tows a 3000 pound rig  There is no strain on this truck at all  I am sure this 4 wheel drive monster will be great in the snow and off road  if you do that thing  I paid  16 900 for this 01 truck with 13k on it from a dealer  This may be the best vehicle value out there for my needs   haul the family  boat  art  dogs and family without mortgaging the ranch  As for the back seats  stop winning  you bargained for a 2 door and that is what you got  saving you a couple of thousand in the process and giving you a much better looking vehicle than the 4 door as well as adding a few miles per gallon  
Pos, I 146m personally not a big fan of large SUVs  They use massive amounts of gasoline 151mileage is generally in the low teens 151and owing to their nearly three ton weight and high bumpers constitute a danger to anyone in a smaller vehicle  especially if that vehicle is a lower riding car or minivan  Yet even I am not entirely immune to their appeal  There is something fascinating about vehicles so large  probably the same thing that is fascinating about large beasts such as elephants and hippos  and large anything for that matter  Size is impressive to the animal brain  Recently I had a coupon for a free oil change at a Ford dealer  It was supposed to be a  147fast lube 148 but with nine cars in line ahead of me it was not  So I took the opportunity to indulge my revulsion fascination complex with large SUVs by taking a 2003 Expedition for a test drive My motivations were a bit more sophisticated than I have let on  I knew that Ford had substantially revised the Expedition for 2003  The revised styling follows the path set by the 2002 Explorer  with the largest change being a less round and more massive looking front end  Most intriguing to me  steering changed from recirculating ball to rack and pinion and the live rear axle was tossed in favor of an independent rear suspension to improve handling   Handling more than any other area affects my satisfaction with a vehicle  As in the 2002 Explorer  the new rear suspension permitted a much lower load floor  promising a larger rear seat There 146s also some history here  GM used to own the large SUV market  Then Ford finally got around to introducing its own full size four door SUV in 1997  and that first Expedition was instantly a success  GM responded with its own substantially redesigned large SUVs in 2000  and they 146ve regained some of the lost ground  This intense competition for high margin sales  large SUVs command much higher prices than mid sized SUVs  but do not cost that much more to produce  explains why Ford so substantially revised the Expedition for 2003 b Styling  As with the 2002   a href content 39524011652 Explorer a b   click for my review  I like the new styling much better than the old  The rounder front fenders of the first generation Expedition  as successful as they were at adapting Ford 146s aero look to a truck  were just a bit too pretty for a truck  The new styling makes the vehicle look stronger and more up to date  rounded forms are on their way  147out 148 without resorting to an overly macho theme  i e  the Avalanche  Some people complain that the Explorer and Expedition look too much alike  I don 146t have a problem with this personally  The point of styling is not to entertain auto journalists or third parties  The point is to give owners the  147look 148 they want  If they want the  147Ford SUV look 148 and the Explorer is large enough inside  then that 146s the way to go  If they want this look  but need a larger SUV  then that 146s what the Expedition is for  No one complains that Cheerios uses the same graphics on the 15oz and the 22oz box  right  And if every different size cereal box had a different look  wouldn 146t this lead to even more confusion in the cereal aisle  By similarly styling and naming its SUVs  Ford presents a clearer image and simplifies customers 146 decision making  Finally  wouldn 146t it be worse if they looked different  and people who only needed a mid sized SUV but really liked the look of the big one were thus forced to buy more gas guzzling truck than they need  So I have no problem with Ford SUVs looking alike Inside the Expedition has also been de rounded  The round forms of the old dash are gone  replaced by a more conventional arrangement  The most prominent features of the new dash are a large swath of black plastic across the driver 146s side and Audiesque rotating metallic finish rings that adjust the volume flowing through the vents  To my eye  the latter are much more aesthetically successful than the former  I 146m not sure what all of this black plastic is for  Minimizing glare  based on the Mercedes line of thinking  The Lincoln version isn 146t similarly blessed  so even if this is the line of reasoning Ford can 146t be too committed to it  Overall  I find the interior restyle less successful Ford claims that the new truck 146s interior materials are an improvement  with VW as the benchmark  They are an improvement 151this is a nicer interior than that of the new Explorer 151but VW is still a ways off  There 146s still a large amount of hard plastic to be found here   Accommodations  Hopefully  people who buy an Expedition do so for reasons beyond an infatuation with size  To whit  hopefully they need to carry a large amount of people and or stuff over nasty roads  or even off road  Let 146s cover the capacity issue first The Expedition is a big vehicle in all dimensions  length  wide  and height  This permits a large interior  even after allowing for generous ground clearance  Now  just about any car claims to fit three adults in the back seat  However  few have enough shoulder room to fit three comfortably  i e  shoulders not crammed into each other  middle person not sitting on a high  hard lump  etc  No problem here  All three rows have enough shoulder room for three adults to fit with little or no touching  A split bench is standard on the first two trim levels up front  so an Expedition can be configured to carry nine people  The upper trim lines  including the top of the line Eddie Bauer I drove  are fitted with buckets and a center console  I found the driver 146s seat fairly comfortable  especially after I deflated the lumbar support  an earlier driver had pumped it all the way up  I found the driving position much better than that in the current Explorer  In the Explorer  the windshield header and sun visors intruded on my vision  It was like a billed hat I couldn 146t take off  In the Expedition  I sat well above the dash  affording an excellent view out all around  yet the top of my vision was also unblocked  Much  much better  No improvements possible here  Huge mirrors were also much appreciated Many cars these days do not provide enough interior storage  No problem with the Expedition I drove  The center console  which reduces seating capacity to eight  has a HUGE storage compartment in it  A small dog could be stored in there or  more likely  a laptop computer and or good sized purse  This compartment was topped by a padded leather armrest  Also nice  Smaller storage areas are scattered throughout the interior The Eddie Bauer Expedition I drove had the  147climate control 148 seats  These include not only heating  but also air conditioning  each with five strength settings  I set the seat A C to  1475 148 but never noticed a difference  I would suggest saving  625 by forgoing this option  except it 146s the only way to get heated seats  and these can be very nice to have on cold mornings with leather  You 146re call  just know the seat A C isn 146t worth much In the second row  the truck I drove had a bench split in three pieces  The middle piece can be slid forward  to position it closer to the front row  something parents with small children might like  Two captains chairs separated by a center console with a large storage compartment  as in the Lincoln Navigator  are a  795 option  Be aware that while the seats fold the console will not  so with all seats folded it sticks up a few inches above the otherwise nearly flat load floor  Second row seat comfort is pretty good  definitely better than that in most smaller SUVs and minivans  The seat cushion is nearly high enough to provide good thigh support  The cushion is padded and contoured enough so you don 146t feel you 146re sitting on a board  To get to the third row  either outboard section of the second row tilts forward in two fairly easy steps   Not quite easy enough for children to manage  which might not be a bad thing The real surprise is in the third row  Ford 146s main reason for eating the approximately  200 additional cost of an independent rear suspension was to avoid packaging a center differential with 10 148 or so of travel  This permitted the floor to be lowered nine inches  a huge amount  This lower floor permits two things  First  it permits a surprisingly roomy third seat  Now  many vehicles these days offer a third row seat  including many minivans and an increasing number of SUVs  I 146ve sat in many of these third row seats  I didn 146t sit in them any longer than I had to  though  They tend to be uncomfortable  and they tend to be mounted so close to the floor that my knees are at chest level  I don 146t like sitting like this  In the Expedition  in contrast  the seat cushion is generously sized and padded and is mounted high enough above the lower floor that I had plenty of thigh support  move even than in the second row  Overall  I found the third row seat to be the most comfortable in the vehicle  more comfortable than the second seats in most alternatives are far ahead of any third row seat I 146ve sampled  Among SUVs  only the even larger Suburban comes close  Quite an achievement The lower floor also permits this large  comfortable seat to fold completely into it  leaving a flat load surface behind  Ford faced a choice here  They could have used the lower floor to expand cargo volume by making the seats removable  as before  They elected instead to keep cargo volume constant 151and thus substantially less than a minivan s 151and eliminate the need to remove any seats  ever  I suspect the great majority of buyers will favor this decision  as removing and storing seats tends to be quite inconvenient  For maximum cargo volume  though  a minivan remains a better choice  as the reduced ground clearance and removable seats permit a taller cargo area My test vehicle had the  455 power folding third row option  Worth the  455  Probably not to me  but I 146d suggest personally evaluating the effort involved in the non power version b On the Road  The revisions for 2003 have added a few hundred pounds to an already hefty vehicle  So even with the 260 horsepower 5 4 liter V8 acceleration is just adequate with a moderate load  By this I mean it felt neither underpowered nor equipped with power to spare  It moved as quickly as I wanted to  which admittedly is not too quickly  this being a large vehicle   The   a href content 6904319620 Toyota Sequoia a b  is about equally powerful  the GM SUVs have an edge here  Towing a heavy load and or carrying a full load of passengers might lead some people to desire more power  but as I did neither I cannot say  I can say that even when pushed the engine sounded quieter and more sophisticated than past Expeditions and competing GM products  With the accelerator floored  the transmission shifted well short of the redline  at about 5500 RPM  perhaps because going above that level on an engine with a low power peak makes no sense Handling was another pleasant surprise  The steering and brake efforts were nicely firm where they used to be overly light  Roll in turns is moderate  Unlike past Expeditions  I no longer felt I was driving a boat  Not a sports car  either  but I generally felt the new Expedition could be handled with adequate precision and  perhaps most important  a sense of control  Overall  its handling felt similar to that of the Toyota Sequoia  Sadly  the ride is not quite up to the almost Lexus like Sequoia 146s or even the Tahoe s  Over some surfaces the generally composed if not quite luxurious ride felt a bit jittery  though never uncomfortably rough  Still  I never felt the degree of body on frame shimmer that turned me off the current Explorer  Overall  ride qualoty is adequate  but I expect better The interior is fairly quiet  even at highway speeds  with one qualification  Whenever the A C was on  at any setting  a loud blower stayed on at the rear of the vehicle  I tried and failed to find a way to cut this blower off without turning the A C completely off  I think this blower recirculates air  pulling it through a vent at the very back  but even turning off  147recirc 148 didn 146t kill it  There has got to be a better way  On the positive side  the climate control system appears well up to handle the task of heating and cooling all three rows of this large vehicle   Pricing  The moderately loaded Eddie Bauer Expedition I drove carried a sticker of  45 190  Yes  quite shocking  But corrective actions are possible  The new  147safety canopy 148  airbag to protect the first and second rows in a rollover  and  147AdvanceTrac 148  stability control  are impressive safety features  but together add nearly  1 400 to the sticker  I 146ve already mentioned the climate controlled seat and power folding seat options  another  1 080  Not yet mentioned is the nicely sized but  800 moonroof  Yet more can be saved by going with the XLT trim  where the luxury of leather is still available  Equip an XLT to   a href content 68354674308 Honda Pilot EX a b  levels  and the sticker drops under forty  Still nine grand over the smaller but in some ways nicer Honda  but more help is on the way  The Honda sells at or above sticker  while according to Edmunds Ford dealers typically accept four grand under sticker  Add in Ford 146s current  2 500 rebate  and the likely transaction price for a still well equipped Expedition comes to just over  33 000  Suddenly the price seems quite reasonable  doesn 146t it  Even further reductions are possible by doing without leather  front buckets  and so on GM s full size SUVs  such as the   a href content 75746086532 GMC Yukon a b  tend to cost a bit more than the Expedition  For reasons discussed in my review of the Yukon  I prefer the Ford The   a href content 6904319620 Toyota Sequoia a b  costs much more than the Ford or GM SUVs  even though dealers are finally discounting them  The big Toy is more refined  but low on power and not as roomy  I prefer the Ford b Last Words  Generally I 146d still recommend a smaller  more fuel efficient vehicle  but if you need to carry seven or more  adults  comfortably  there are few other choices  and those aren 146t much more efficient  For many uses  a minivan will do as well or better  but off road and or travel over uneven or unplowed snow covered roads can justify the space robbing  weight adding ground clearance of the Expedition  With these qualifications  I can recommend this vehicle  With the changes for 2003  the seating comfort  interior versatility  and handling feel now exceed the closest competition  Acceleration  some areas of handling  and ride quality still lag  but among large SUVs this is now my favorite b Update November 2003 b This fall Nissan has entered the large SUV arena with its Pathfinder Armada and Dodge has introduced a new  singificantly larger Durango  After driving both my preference for the Expedition remains  though the Dodge is a close second  The new Durango is much quicker than the Expedition  feels more maneuverable  rides better  and costs less  Its disadvantages include a less comfortable third row  less shoulder room  and a cheap looking interior  The Nissan is also much quicker than the Ford  but its chassis feels very trucky and its interior quality is abysmal for a  40 000 vehicle I ve noticed that Expeditions  front wheels are often thickly coated with black brake dust  They appear to have a problem in this area  If you must always have a clean looking car  plan on washing this one s wheels often My reviews of related vehicles b a href content 75746086532 GMC Yukon a b   equivalent to

Pos, Let me first preface my thoughts by assuring you that I do not work for any car manufacturer  After considering the Acura MDX  Chevy Tahoe and Toyota Sequoia  I went with the 2003 Eddie Bauer 4x2 5 4L Expedition  I must admit that I have been reticent about American cars in recent years and at first was leaning toward the MDX  My primary fear was quality  However  after extensive research and a test drive of all four  I think Ford has the best product for the price Ford really did a good job with the new Expedition  It looks like Ford actually listened to the feedback from the previous Expedition drivers  strange concept  and then built the new Expedition  Examples of what I am talking about 1  Design  The interior design  while still American at heart  is clearly not the same old Ford  For example  Ford seems to have a habit of slapping together a confusing array of tiny plastic buttons and lights and then calling it a dash  Did Ford actually think that people like to have a readout that looks like one of those blinking light panels that Spock always used to stare at  The new dash really looks somewhat like the new Audi  See the air conditioning vents and two tone black and tan dash  I just wish they had gone all the way with this concept  There are still some of the old Ford here with tiny buttons and green led lights  I d prefer 100  analog except where absolutely necessary  2  No More Noisy Wishy Washy Ride  The frame is stiffer  Outside noise seems to be less  There is also rear independent suspension  The ride is really nice and the steering is apparently much improved 3  Convenience  The third and second row seats fold down completely flat  Storage is everywhere  The Eddie Bauer edition even has buttons to lower the third row from the back  No need to haul in and out huge unwieldy third row seats  Seat memory  In dash 6 CD  Pop down mini wide angle rear view mirror to keep an eye on activity in the aft section  DVD for the kids  Second row middle seat slides forward  This is great if you ve got a kid in a child s seat back there 4  Quality  I know that I just bought the thing  But the fact of the matter is that the Expedition just seems to be built to last  No jiggles on the highway and a general sense of solidity 5  Price  Maybe I just had a better negotiating experience with my dealer  but the price I got it below invoice bringing the 41 000 sticker down to 33 000  When compared to the competition  this was hands down the best option On the downside  while apparently more efficient than previous models  the Expedition still likes to consume gasoline  Also  while most of the upgrades seem quality  a few seem like less than first rate  To give you an idea what I am talking about and I concede this is nit picky  the sunglass holder kind of jumps down at you when you push the button  In my 1997 Pathfinder  when you hit the sunglass holder button  it gracefully slides open  The leather also seems to be a little lower grade than some of the top of the line SUV s  e g  Acura  
Pos, My husband and I went on the dreaded search for the new  family car  We knew that we wanted an SUV  and were leaning toward the Tahoe  I come from a diehard GM family  My parents have leased 2 Tahoes in the last 4 years  and I had driven them frequently  I found them to be comfortable  however they always felt like they were top heavy when turning corners and such  I had read that the new Expedition had come out with flat fold seats  and I knew that we had to check this out  I have to admit  I never thought we would buy a Ford  but the minute I drove it  I LOVED it  It seems to have way more room in it than the Tahoe  My husband is 6 4  so we need all the leg room   head room that we can get  I also love the way that you sit up high  it seems to give a better view of your surroundings  The interior is very driver friendly  everything is within arms reach  The center console is HUGE  Lots of cupholders  even in every door  The seating is the real winner  Ford really designed this well  The 2nd row of seats are separated into 3 individual seats  which allows for any number of seating arrangements  Plus  the middle seat in the second row slides forward to be directly up against the console  It puts a infant right behind you  But for those of you without children  it allows for the people sitting in the 3rd row of seats to have a ton more leg room  We went on a 90 mile round trip with 6 very tall adults and everyone commented on how comfortable it was  They could not believe the leg room  The 3rd row fold down seats are the best  We knew that we wanted a 3rd row of seats for those rare times when we would need them  but we also knew that we did not have the room to store them  This was an answer to prayers  I find them very easy to put up or down  Overall  we are very pleased with this vehicle  It does tend to slurp up the gas in town  but what big SUV doesn t  It is very stable  turns on a dime  makes us feel very safe P S  My mom is jealous she hates her brand new Yukon  
Pos, I have a 1993 Ford Probe SE  It has approximately 88 000 miles on it  It is a five speed  The car has power windows  power door locks  power sunroof  and power seats  These are very luxurious and make the car very enjoyable to drive  I have the low profile tires for it which are standard on the SE  The probe has an equalizer to compliment the stereo which has a tape player  I am going to get a cd player for it soon  The color is blue green and the inside is black and gray  The car looks very sleek and very sporty  I enjoy driving it every time  The car is quick and handles very well  It has an driver s side air bag and anti lock brakes which are nice to have  On the highway the car is very smooth and quiet  You can barely hear the engine running  The one thing I do not like is that once in a while there is a little rattle inside the dashboard which is common for probes  When I am driving it I definetly feel like I am driving a sports car  If I didn t know it I would think I was driving a Porshe  Everyone on the road checks out the car because of it looks and style  The sunroof is nice to have in the summer just having the air rush in over you  The people who should buy this vehicle are people who love speed  sporty cars  and quickness  There are plenty of saftey features on car so parents will like it for their children  Anyone who wants a big slow car shouldn t buy it br br  
Pos, I bought a 93 Probe GT in 97 5 speed  no automatic for me  when I first saw the new designed Probes I knew I would someday buy one  so when I got a good job I went out and bought my dream car  At first it was awesome I never drove a car that handled so good or accelerated so fast  everyone gave me compliments on how nice the car looked  But when I bought the car it had 84 000kms 52500miles  and with most cars this is when things started going wrong with it  I will list in order my problems I had 1  o2 sensors the probe has two of them when not working properly the car will use a lot of gas and show a engine lite on  parts are very expensive  note  if you live anywhere where they do emission testing the car will fail with the o2 sensors not working 2  valve cover gasket   oil will leak into the spark plug holes causing the wire to short out  gasket price is cheap but there is a lot of labor involved 3  ABS sensor the car will make a buzzing noise and show the ABS lite on  you can still drive the car like this but the abs will not work parts are expensive 4  water pump there is a lot of labor involved in this job too   I would definitely recommend to change the timing belt when doing this job because the probe has a interference engine and if the belts ever breaks the valves will crash into the pistons 5  Air bag sensor lite  a lot of Probes owners I have talked to have had these five problems the air bag lite sensor is usually the problem but I was told only the dealership can do the diagnostics and they are expensive  Now I know that all cars have there problems but the Probe is special in which almost all the parts on it are twice to three times more than most cars  from the exhaust to the struts  but I think sometimes in life you buy a car that just can not part with and this car is mine  I have heard of a lot of other problems the Probe has  like the automatic transmissions have a lot of problems  But now that the probe is discontinued you can get one for pretty cheap  just make sure you check to see if the previous owner got this work done  above  Just remember parts are expensive  and winter driving in deep snow is not fun due the fat tires and light back end of the Probe  I still own this car today and have no plans to sell it  the probe has it own unique look where most new cars are all looking the same  
Pos, I fell in love with the looks of this car the moment I saw one on the road  I finally got around to buying one last October  93 GT  73K miles  and I paid  5K for it Looks like the previous owner hadn t done much with it  I got it from a dealer  so within a month I had replaced the water pump and the muffler  both of which failed on my first long drive in the car  Cost me about 600 bucks for everything put together  but thats it    water pump replacement is part of the 60K service  which apparently wasn t done I ve currently got 91K miles on it  yes I drive quite a lot  and the only periodic expense has been the oil changes  At the 90K service I got the rear brakes changed and also the spark plug wires  total cost of service  400 or so  and since then things have been phenomenal  Its a lot of fun to blow off V 6 camaros and mustangs at stop lights  even though they catch up with you down the road  but I have only praise for the acceleration of this car My car is black  and I wash wax her every fortnight  and I get a lot of appreciative looks for the trouble  She s a good cruiser   I ve done two trips of 2000 miles and 1400 miles  with no complaints whatsoever The niggling points are 1  body noises on all but the smoothest roads   thats supposed to be a problem for all 93 probes though 2  the idling screws up sometimes   varies between 750rpm and 1200 rpm  but gets alright in an hour or so 3  the power antenna is stuck   another common probe problem Probes are cheap  I have seen 94 GTs with 70K for about  5000 recently  so if you get a cheap deal  buy it   you certainly will not regret it if you keep the car well  Forget about resale value though   you won t even get peanuts for this car  Since I plan to run mine until the bitter end  I m not concerned about that I ve also done a lot of driving on back roads  I think the turning cornering capabilities are pretty good too  Its a hard ride though   and I m too poor to replace the shocks  and takes some getting used to  The tires are dunlops  previous owner  and have decent grip  no fishtailing in the snow and that sort of thing If you want to buy this car  remember that the rear seat is strictly for emergency purposes I dont know why Ford put it in to begin with  This would have made a great 2 seater br br  
Pos, In October of 2000 I bought a 1993 Ford Probe GT and it is the best car of its kind  I love the front room and the hatch room but no one can fit in back unless they are under 4  I dislike the performance probably cuz I m used to my old Mustang 5 0  Off the start  it aint to bad  but after 3rd you just get blown away if you don t have mods which I am in the process of putting on  Overall  the looks kick ass  and I would recommend the car for anyone who doesn t have 60 000 for a corvette br br  
Pos, I bought my car in 1995  It was built in 1993  I was in college at the time  and it was perfect for my lifestyle  It is a fun  sporty car that was just right for a college girl  Since I ve been married  I wish I had picked a slightly more practical model  There is very little room for groceries  yard stuff and other things that you have to buy when you live in an adult world with a house  And the backseat is a real pain in the neck to crawl in and out of I haven t given it up though  because I love zooming around in it  The radio is great  the car is comfy  and it handles wonderfully  I have had more than what I consider average problems with it  The brakes  exhaust  and muffler have all had to be replaced  The trunk latch has been broken for the past year or so  which makes it next to impossible to put anything in the trunk  The lighter was broken for awhile Overall  this is a wonderful car if you have a lifestyle conducive to a sports car but no money for a sports car br br  
Pos, Our family purchased our 1992 Explorer XLT in March 2000 from a good friend of ours who had to move across the world  We knew the car had been impeccably taken care of so it was an offer we couldn t pass up After driving around in the Explorer for a few days  I soon discovered a new dimension of driving   seeing the road ahead  Now I rarely go out to drive my father s car   I feel like my rear end is dragging on the road In XLT trim  the Explorer fits anyones requirements for a vehicle  The bright beige interior is showing little sign of wear  the leather seating is slightly torn on the drivers seat  near a seam on the bottom  after 100 000 town hopping miles  a slight tear is much less than to be expected  Ours came with 6 way power seats for both front passengers with lumbar and bolster for the driver and just lumbar for the passenger  they re still supportive and comfortable  The rear seat is like new   the only thing   on bumpy roads  the springs in the rear seat squeak  The rear cargo area is very durable  with a thick  padded carpet  The cargo cover still operates and provides added safety and privacy  The nicely equipped instrument panel is still fully operational as is the radio cassette player  Occasionally a tape will jam  probably needs greasing up again  Also  the center storage area has two large cupholders and a huge storage area for cassettes and underneath the cassette holder there is an area for CDs or other stuff Exterior treatments are shiny and the chrome glistens in the daylight  The factory tint or  privacy glass  is handy in high summer and really sets off the deep forest green exterior with the beige interior  The aluminum wheels are shiny but the lacquer covering was chipped on the edges following the Firestone tire recall   bad mechanic procedures  I simply repainted it with regular lacquer and they re fine again The 4 0L V 6 purrs every time it is started and never has hesitated and can pull me away from a stoplight with pleasant acceleration  It also comes in handy when pulling boats out of slips   even without a 4X4 system  it s still quite a capable vehicle  The ride overall is well controlled and with accurate inputs  the turns can be made so you don t feel like you re gonna fall out the car Shortly after we purchased it  the freon in the A C system leaked out  Where the car is located  you can still purchase R 12 from retailers so I filled it up again with a can or two only to have it gone in a few weeks time  I have since abandoned repair until I can find myself a R 134a conversion kit with some leak stopper where I live Recently  a few other things have cropped up that are slightly annoying  Inside the power window motors are three plastic cogs which slip anytime a finger or something gets in between the window  But   you can see this one coming  the plastic wears away over time and now the motor just sits there spinning around with no window movement  A good Ford dealer told me to replace these with metal washers which have indeed done the trick Next  the muffler has begun to break down  First  the tail end of the pipe started to crumble and now both silencing boxes are on the slippery slope of corrosion  I ll have to get this fixed soon Finally  the latest issue has been the paint  The car is in the Bahamas and the roof and the hood basically point to the sun and bake for hours on end  The clear coat on top finally broke away leaving bare base coat  In a hurry to preserve the steel panels of the car I had it repainted and it looks lustrous again  The doors and fenders  i e   anything that doesn t face the sun  were left with the original paint and are really shiny UPDATE  The AM FM Cassette unit which came standard died in the summer of 2003  After a little research I found out the Ford AM FM CD players can be substituted with no wiring changes  Then  I hunted eBay for a few months until I saw an early 90 s unit which would fit the  92 dash  I eventually found one  plugged it in and it is fabulous If you re interested in making this change  the radio removed was Ford base part 19B165  the radio with the toggle style volume knob  The Ford base part 18C815 with the rotary volume knob is the perfect change for  91 and  92 model year Explorers  
Pos, In 1992 I bought my daughter a new Ford Explorer with a promise from her that I drive it until she started college a year later  When she started to college she took the Explorer with her and I drove another car  She drove the Explorer until 1999 when she purchased a 1999 Ford Mustang  I sold the car I was driving at the time and took back the Explorer  So you can see why I entitled this  quot Recycled Explorer quot We had problems with vibrations from the beginning  which I understand was a problem with most 1992 Explorers  The dealer from which I bought the car tried to correct this problem by installing shims  That didn t work and I ve been told that they should not have done this  This is the only major complaint we ve had with the car  Obviously  it was not so big a deal that we sold the vehicle  It now has 103 000 miles on and still going strong  We have had to replace the anti lock brake system and I recently had the rotors replaced  but the rotors are a part of wear and tear that you would normally expect br br  
Pos, I recently purchased a 1992 Explorer  December  and have loved it  I was looking for a SUV  but because of financial restraints  my options were very limited  I have a taste for quality  so i couldn t settle for an old or bad looking vehicle  especially because of the size of a car investment  My choice on this explorer was great  Now  to get to the car  I would like to say that it has tons of room  both in the front seats  back seats and rear cargo space  It is very comfortable and with all automatic features  it couldn t be more simple  The seats  mirrors  windows and locks are all automatic  When looking at other SUV s of it s relative size  one overlooked feature that I have found to be very convenient is the option on the tailgate for opening either just the glass or the whole door itself  It makes quick trunk exchanges very simple  It has so far been very maintenance free  I have had it for just over 5 months now and it has not been to the shop once  With 68 000 miles on a sport utility  that is not bad  And the price was great too  Oh yeah  and not to forget the four wheel drive feature  This too is activated with the push of a button  making the shift quick and easy for the emergency situations  The room inside with all the convenient features make this SUV a great purchase for anyone  whether it be a family or just someone who likes the extra space for cargo or other needed use looking for comfort and space     
Pos, My mom bought this SUV a few years ago  and its been nothing but trouble  The motor and the transmission was already replaced in this SUV  and it s only 8 years old   1992  We bought it because of its sporty looks and durability and off roading ability  But we had no idea what was in store Since I have gotten my learners license  I was actually allowed to drive this car  The Explorer I noticed at first is very very preppy and has lots of horsepower  Just stepping on the accelerator and it leaps forward  ready for action  When I m waiting at the stop line at an intersection  sometimes people look at me as a learner who just puts along and avoids everything  When the light turns green I leap forward and I beat everybody and zoom ahead  You should see the looks on their faces when I am way ahead of them  The 4X4 in the winter works really well  handles any kind of weather conditions  The only thing is that its really noisy when you turn it on and you have to go outside to switch the switch to go offroad  When you do  its a bumpy ride and juggly  The steering is crisp and responsive  but the power steering groans when you turn it too much  The brakes respond very quickly and straight The bad thing is that it has gone through a lot of repairs  Either that or this is a lemon we got  The door handle has broken off  radiator replaced  timing belt broken  electrical problems  the lights go on and off for no reason  Of course there was the daily tuneups and fixes etc  The windshield wiper switch is broken and the light switch is in a weird spot  Sometimes the oil leeks into the motor  and burning of course creating smoke  It doesn t really go well up long  high hills without overheating  The seats are alright  but in the back its kinda uncomfortable after a while  not very cushy   When it gets to high speeds it jiggles around and starts squeaking and you can t hear the radio that well at highway conditions  At city speeds its fine  The radio that they give you is fine  but not great  Also the gas mileage is not that great  especially when you have the 4X4 on  it just gobbles the gas up like crazy   not very good these days with the gas prices rising So this is a pretty reliable SUV  and if you want lots of pep  this is the car for you  The only thing is that the repair bills is high and your wallet will get lighter  Maybe ours was a lemon  but its good for a family br br  
Pos, I bought this 4 wheel drive truck in February of 1995 because I liked my 1987 4WD Ranger so much  The Supercab has greater room for seat back movement and a larger  4 0 vs 2 9  engine  The only thing I wish it had is air conditioning  The autolocking hubs and push button  on the fly transfer case engagement have worked flawlessly  I get 22 24 MPG and the original 265x15 quot  tires lasted about 65K miles  amazing  One does get used to the power of the engine and it now seems a little weak  though I am sure it hasn t lost any ooomph  The cassette player started refusing to change directions and ended up  quot eating quot  tapes after 4 years  55K miles  I replaced it with a JVC radio cassette 12 CD changer from Crutchfield  I then heard vastly improved sounds from the speakers I will buy another Ranger when the time comes   or an Explorer if I no longer need a truck  If you can find this truck with reasonable mileage and price  go for it  It is terrific in snow Tis tough to give the  quot amount paid quot   below  cuz I traded in my 1987 Ranger  The price I have put in was the sticker price  Get list and invoice prices from Edmunds com before you go looking for any vehicles br br  
Pos, At first glance  it looks like you Uncle Ernie in Florida s grand marquis   and some other times  it looks like the feds or local police are after you  but on the other side of the windshield  lies magnificent comfort  and classic large interior and seating  in leather on this sport model  Look downwards to the  police radio   lol  and find a leather wrapped floor shifter for its butter smooth 4 speed auto transmission  This is not Uncle Ernies retirement car  it s a rocket ride  Thats right  police and this sport share in the 235 horse power motor  4 6   new modular technology   v 8 motor along with real dual exhaust  I wish it were a tad bit louder  like its big cousin the Maurader  but you can add from my research Dynaflow for a slightly louder rumble  Gas mileage has been fair to good  keeping my feet off the pedal is hard to do  especially when you turn traction control off  you can lay one hell of a big burnout  ala 60 s and 70 s style  The paint finish is fabu  no defects  inspected the engine and it is well constructed  although they could fancied up the engine area and added a nicer air cleaner    i would opt for a after market air filter and canister   and nicer trim in engine compartment would help  The wheels are 17 inchers and the tires Goodyear  now if you read my article on the 97 Jetta  you ll know that Goodyear tires are somewhat soft and wear faster  we will see how these LS model tires work out  Ive seen the 2003 Crown Vic Sport and i can honestly tell you that the 2002 is bound to be a classic  the wheels on the 2003 are narrower to make way for clearance with the new rack and pinion front end on 2003 models  i prefer the 2002 look my self  also gone are the plush leather seats  they are now ALA Marauder style ribbed leather  SO far i have put on 5 900 hundred miles and have had the first service done  also i might note that insurance for this car was alot less than most cars  thank goodness for Uncle Ernie   
Pos, 108 000 miles  3 brothers  and 15 years later our little 4 Door LX Hatchback Blue Escort is still capable of cruising down California roads  Four days ago  however  the Escort entered into retirement when I purchased a new car  The car has held up excellent throughout the years and is only showing signs a few minor problems now  well after 100 000 miles Compared to cars today the LX Escort offers very little in terms of options  It has an air conditioning system which provides ample amount of both cold and hot air  but when it s turned on the engine really loses a lot of power  It is not recommend to turn on the air conditioning when traveling uphill or at times when you need every bit of power the engine can give you  The car comes with a standard Ford stereo which is basically an AM FM stereo minus a cassette player  The speakers do an adequate job of handling any power  but again compared to today s standards sound terrible  They are not capable of handling very much bass before they start to make a crackling sound  The car also offers powering steering  automatic front shoulder belts  and a warning noise if you leave your lights on  The best feature of the Escort has been it s gas mileage  I ve been able to achieve 320 miles on one tank of gas  With high gas prices in California  refueling my tank every 3 weeks or more was a blessing  The car is capable of getting more than 320 miles to the tank  but you may start dipping into your reserve fuel The worse feature of the Escort is unfortunately the safety concerns  This car was built before airbags were required in cars  and because it s so small a massive collision could be potentially very harmful  Although the shoulder belts automatically strap on they provide very little safety it seems  I ve pulled on the shoulder straps violently several times and they have failed to catch  I m not sure if this is age or if it happened when the car was new  since the car was passed down to me  The car also offers poor handling  The tires are small and overall the car is very light  High winds have a tendency to blow this car from side to side and you can t take turns too fast without feeling like your going to tip over  But the Escort LX did exactly what it was supposed to do  It offered a quality car to get you where you wanted to go  This car offers no luxury but it wasn t purchased for luxury  It was purchased to get three boys to and from college  and it succeeded in doing that for 15 years  If your looking at purchasing an Escort LX  Kelly Blue Book recommends that the car price not exceed  700 to  1100  This is for a car with no major mechanical or body defects  I think the car would be perfect for someone on a really tight budget that just needs a car to get them from point A to point B  
Pos, The Ford Contour  a driver s car for the rest of us  For under  20 000  here is a domestic sedan that can keep up with the entry level offerings from Germany  The Contour s driving behavior is comparable to the Audi A4  Volkswagen Jetta  and BMW 323i  What these models have over the Contour are uprate interiors of fancy plastics and bank vault feel as well as brand panache  better resale and superior available mechanicals  like Audi s Quattro and BMW s sporty rear wheel drive  But if you can t come up with  25 000 30 000  you don t have to settle for an garden variety Accord  Altima or Grand Am  Unlike many inexpensive cars  the Contour has a playful yet composed personality and is more than willing to be your curvy back road eating friend My Contour is a 1998 5 SE Sport model with the 2 5L Duratec V6 and the MTX 75 5 speed manual transmission  The Sport trim level added features like alloy wheels  the V6  spoiler  fog lamps  leather wrapped wheel shifter  floor mats  My car also features leather trimmed seating and a power  sliding moonroof  Since I had to take delivery on a car from a dealer lot to get cheap  0 9 60 months  Ford financing  I didn t get all the options I wanted  It is difficult to find the Contour in the V6 5spd form  at least in my urban location  Other options I wanted as well but could not find on a lot were ABS  traction control and a split  folding rear seat The Duratec V6 is one of the Contour s greatest assets  It s not a perfect engine and some close competitor s engines are arguably better  like VW s 2 8L VR6  but the Duratec helps elevate the Contour from a Tempo replacement to something unexpected for an inexpensive domestic compact sedan  It loves to rev  It makes sweet mechanical music  It doesn t wheeze or sound stressed  It pulls all the way to the fairly high redline of 6750 rpm  Mid range torque is excellent for this class  Tasks like passing and highway merging are relaxed  fun  when you have the Duratec  The power the Duratec generates surprises other drivers in their 200hp V6 mid size sedans  It also surprises the college kids in their Integras as you pull away from them  I wouldn t necessarily call a V6 equipped Contour FAST  but it is certainly spirited  What limits the Duratec s appeal is a lack of low end torque and an unrefined transition when the secondaries kick open at 3500rpm  Some people LIKE the kick from the engine at 3500rpm  However  after driving German V6s  I prefer a smooth build up of power  not an abrupt one  But the kick is part of the engine design  not a problem  and helps give the Contour a little edge  a little personality  Overall  the Duratec is similar to a Honda VTEC engine albeit with less refinement and turbine smoothness  but with a more workable powerband One of the best things about the Contour is the availability  actually it s standard  of a 5 speed manual transmission with the base 4cyl engine AND the Duratec V6  You can t get a V6 5spd on the Accord  Grand Prix Regal Intrigue  Galant  Altima  Malibu or Grand Am Alero  The Contour s manual transmission is easy to use  The shifter is of the notchy variety  While most enthusiasts prefer the rubbery feel of BMW s stick shift  the notchiness makes it easy to find the Contour s gears  The clutch is fairly strong and relatively easy to engage  It doesn t require much pressure and isn t as  quot spring loaded quot  as some other clutches  The Contour is my first stick shift car and I found it a very good candidate to learn on   Honda s manuals are probably the best for novices  As any car geek will tell you  a manual transmission allows you to have real fun with a car  The 5spd transmission allows you to keep the Duratec in its powerband for passing and for turns  Together  they make the Contour a reason to get up in the morning If horsepower and flat out acceleration were everything  I d be driving a Camaro Z28 with its 305 hp 5 7L V8  But as I ve said before  the Contour is a driver s car  not a stoplight racer  What allows the Contour to be compared to the German models is its grasp of the driving fundamentals  handling  steering  brakes  You can throw the Contour around  It s easy to brake before a turn and control the car through the turn with throttle  There is moderate  but predictable understeer  The steering is very communicative and adjusts its attitude over various speeds  At low speeds  you can feel imperfections in the road and anything that might get you in trouble  It is also responsive  At fast highway speeds  the steering is appropriately heavy and not twitchy  The suspension feels very European  The ride is supple  though some American drivers will find it too harsh  Since I am in my 20s  I don t care so much about ride as I do about handling  Unless you buy a world class car like the BMW 740i  you have to make a compromises between ride and handling  A base SE or LX will have a smoother ride than my SE Sport  but with lower roadholding limits  The Contour has a very reassuring pose that rewards spirited driving  Body roll is present  though not a problem and is a bit better controlled than others in this class  Steer the Contour through an emergency maneuver and the car stays planted to the road  After a sudden move  the car regains composure quickly and waits for your next input  Although the Contour may not be loaded with the latest  quot safety feature of the month quot  I consider its excellent driving mannerisms a big safety feature  The Contour s brakes are very good  a result of a nice  progressive pedal feel and a system that stops the car straight and short  The brakes have a good bite that may surprise you if you are used to the weak stuff GM makes All these qualities add up to a car you ll probably drive just for the heck of it  You ll want to find those little used back roads to play on  I ve taken my car out for a few drives where I try to nail it to redline  take turns at high speeds and  of course  develop a very brisk pace  The car is very stable at 90mph and I have managed to take it to 108  At that point  I feel like my driving ability is at its limit  rather than the car  Even after a tiring day of play  the engine and brakes maintain their performance  This car has high limits  If you don t typically drive in a spirited fashion  you ll still appreciate the Contour s driving competence  It produces few  if any  surprises and the reassurance it provides might make you pick up your pace a little bit  likely without you realizing it The Contour is America s 3 series  It has a real enthusiast s engine  a proper manual transmission  a suspension that grips the road well  steering that communicates and brakes that stop without incident  It is NOT a 3 series equal  however  and I do not consider my car an apple for apple replacement of a BMW  For instance  the Contour is front wheel drive  while all BMWs have rear wheel drive  BMWs have better refinement and higher limits  BUT we aren t talking about a  30 000 car here  a nicely equipped 323i  You can t reasonably expect a  17 000 car to equal a  30 000 one  And the Contour doesn t  Rather  the Contour gives you the best version of German engineering of any American Asian car under  25 000  That includes the Intrigue  The toughest argument against the Contour is the VW Jetta  The Jetta certainly has a better interior by far and its VR6 engine is a real thrill  But it costs thousands more  doesn t handle as crisply and has a meager 2yr 24K bumper to bumper warranty  On paper  the Jetta appears to be a winner  but since you can get the Contour near invoice whereas the Jetta goes near sticker  the battle lines blur From a practicality perspective  the Contour is less impressive  though still capable  The trunk is fairly large and has much usable space  Entry exit is easy from the front seats  though the much scorned back seat has room for improvement  It s tight back there and I can t imagine having 3 adults sit there anymore than a very short distance  Since I am single  I use the back seat floor as a way to convenient way to haul groceries and other items  they roll around in the trunk  Visibility is good from the front and sides  though the rear view is a little abbreviated  The dashboard has a simple design and buttons are easy to locate  However  the stereo is too low in the dash  The front cupholders are possibly the most pathetic feature in the car  They can t hold anything  I really like the appearance of the instrumentation   crisp and easy to read  However  I can t stand the econocar plastic that abounds in the interior  VW does a much better job in this aspect and I wish Ford would give the Contour better feeling and looking plastics  The door panels in the Contour are completely plastic   there should be a cloth leather insert  The seats are comfortable and although they don t have an adjustable lumbar  there is plenty of lower back support for long drives  Since I drive the Contour in a spirited fashion  I wish the seats would hug you a little better  The Contour s heating and cooling systems are first rate  Although they have the old fashioned hot cold dials  not an actual temperature setting  the heater puts out tons of heat and the AC can be downright icy Regrettably  the Contour can t completely shed its American car reliability stereotype  In 15 months  I have had 4 warranty claims  The first was to replace a strip of trim on the roof  The second was to fix a wiring harness behind the headlight switch  The third was to fix a heater blower resistor assembly  The fourth was to replace faulty insulation in the front bumper crash sensors  The last three were official Ford recalls   ADDENDUM 12 17 1999  The number may become 5  I read in AutoWeek that 1998 Contours are being recalled for frayed accelerator cables  All of these claims are troubling  but I don t know what to make of it  Having 5 warranty claims in the first 16 months of ownership would suggest the car is a junker or lemon  However  my Contour really hasn t let me down  The warranty repairs themselves haven t been major in scope  the dealer has been able to make the repairs the same day  Also  Ford has been the one making the recalls  I haven t had to bring my car into the dealer for problems that I ve found myself  I suppose I can put up with these issues simply because I love the way the Contour drives and since it HAS been reliable  However  I think I will be looking for another car after the 36 000 mile warranty expires  That s a shame To be honest  I was scared to buy the Contour because I feared it might be a repair nightmare  I was driving a 1997 Honda Civic at the time  which had not given me any problems in 19K of driving  I was used to the stereotype that Japanese cars drive forever but American cars are Fixed Often Rarely Driven  I got over my  probably misfounded  fears and bought the Contour  using the fact it had a fresh warranty as an excuse  Although my Contour hasn t been flawless in the defect department  I don t worry about it breaking down on me  It may not be a Toyota Corolla  but it is a reasonably well made car  I ve taken it on many trips  including a cross country one  without incident  From what I have read from others  the Contour is no Ford Tempo and bests the poor reliability history of the Stratus and Malibu Other areas of interest  I m not happy with the fuel economy  fetching 20mpg in suburban driving and a max of 26mpg on the interstate  My heavy right foot is partially to blame  but the thirstiness is made worse because of the smallish fuel tank  14 5 gallons  Fortunately  the Duratec happily drinks regular  87 octane gas  The stock tires   Firestone Firehawks   aren t performance tires and limit the car s performance abilities  The headlights are abysmal  I find myself using the high beams a lot  Cabin noise is unremarkable on the highway  with some wind and tire noise protruding  but nothing out of the ordinary  There is a convenient storage space for CDs in the center console  though the right driver armrest can get in the way While the Contour as a complete package is flawed  so is the competition  What makes me  and others  such fans of the car is its remarkable driving behavior  You just can t get this kind of performance and joy from any other sub 20K sedan  The Contour is a reasonable choice   it is functional  inexpensive to insure and operate  not a theft target  comfortable  fairly stylish and is reasonably priced  Unless you have a growing family  the car should accommodate all of your passengers in reasonable comfort  The Contour s last model year will be 2001 as it is being replaced by the new  and excellent  Focus  That s a shame because Ford has a real winner here  one that can be made great with some reworking and refinement FINAL NOTE  While I recommend the Contour with the V6 and 5spd options  I do not recommend the car with the 4cyl Zetec AND the automatic transmission  This drivetrain takes all of the life out of the car  If you need an automatic  stick with the V6  If you can drive stick  the 4cyl Zetec is an acceptable  and economical  choice br br  
Pos, With  1 daughter preparing to get her license and inherit mom s  91 Passat  I went shopping for a replacement  The short list got very short  however  when I decided to consider only cars with timing chains rather than belts  Demanding a chain limits your choices to most GM products  including the Saturn 4 cyl s  and the Ford Duratec V6 family  The Contour was the perfect size   it ll fit 2 adults in back quite comfortably  although 3 will be tight  and it has a large  useful trunk  This year it comes in only 2 flavors  the loaded SE Sport with the quick 2 5 V6  or the very loaded SVT with the VERY quick 2 5 HO V6  And  given that it was mainly designed by Ford of Europe  where it is sold as the Mondeo  its character  amp  demeanor are markedly European  making it the natural successor to our old VW   Volkswagon has taken its prices so far upmarket that they didn t even rate consideration  The seats are more sculpted and orthopedically shaped than anything else Ford  or any other domestic  offers  very similar to those found in Volvos  The thick  leather wrapped wheel fills your hands  While the interior isn t plush  with all vinyl door panels and no chrome or wood trim  the car has some nice thoughtful touches such as a fold down armrest for the driver s bucket and door rocker switches for locks  amp  windows that illuminate at night  The car we bought had the automatic transmission and premium stereo with in dash CD  I passed on ABS  amp  traction control  sticker price was  18500  The local dealer that participated in CarPoint responded with an offer for  17300  or about 3  over cost  I feel this is an excellent price for a car with this level of equipment  and the deal was made all that much sweeter with a  1500 rebate from Ford  This car is a joy to drive  The engine feels eager to run  and the revs come up with turbine like smoothness  Shifting is crisp without feeling harsh  and the computer has adaptive capability so that the car soon acts as if it could anticipate exactly when you want it to shift  The car steers precisely and responsively  It s nicely balanced and very easy to drive quickly  It feels very much like the Cougar which is based on this car  but has the stealthy innocent look of a 4 door sedan  The Contour and its Mercury sister the Mystique qualify as Ford s best kept secrets  The cars receive virtually no advertising  and are destined to be dropped after this model year  This knowledge has induced many enthusiast owners of older models to trade in now for the latest model  It s a pity to see this car go away because it has sporting yet sophisticated qualities that don t come through in its replacement  the Focus     
Pos, I had never considered buying the Ford Contour SVT  but I happened to see one at the dealership  I thought   quot I can t afford that quot  But after looking at the sticker and the markdown sticker  I seriously considered it As part of a former job  I have driven quite a few cars  I would have to say at least 100 different models  Honda  Accord  Civic  Prelude  Chevy  Cavalier  Beretta  Camaro  Monte Carlo  VW  Golf  GTI  VR6  Jetta  Passat  Pontiac  Sunfire  Grand Am  Acura  Integra  Ford  Mustang  Taurus  Escort  BMWs  Audis  Volvos  Mercedes  Lexus  Many SUVs  Etc I test drove the SVT and IMMEDIATELY knew this was the car for me PROS Power  V6  200hp  2 5 liter DOHC  Made by the same guys who make the Ford Mustang Cobra  Wow  great mid range and high end power Exhaust  The sweet tone is like no other  Really reflects the power of this car Handling  It outhandles any car in it s price range hands down  Even better than cars around  30k such as the BMW and Audi  Sticks to the roads and carves the twisties Short clutch  many 5 speeds  such as the Mustang  have a clutch that s really high  The SVT was the perfect height Loaded car  moonroof  leather  power windows  doorlocks  amp  seats  keyless entry  amp  trunk release  for lights  16 quot  alloy wheels  z rated tires Huge trunk  actually is a little too big   should have made the back seat bigger Euro styling and feel to the car CONS Road noise  at high speeds Back seat  Way too cramped Quality  the interior plastic and parts seem kind of cheap I have just passed the recommended 1000 mile break in period  somewhat babying it  I have opened it up since then and am completely addicted  The SVT begs to be redlined and the exhaust makes it that much more difficult  Winding roads are a blast to cruise on SVT has done a wonderful job with this car  It s too bad it s to be discontinued after the 2000 production year I would highly recommend anyone looking for a  22k ish car to check this bad boy out br br  
Pos, The Ford Contour was introduced as a 1994 model and was Ford s first attempt at building a world car  The Contour was designed and built in Europe and is sold there as the Ford Mondeo What model is the best to buy When I was shopping for my car I drove several different models of the Contour  I tried a 4 cylinder automatic  a V 6 automatic  and a V 6 manual  I also tried the base and sport models  The best model is easily the V 6 mated to the 5 speed manual  However  if you prefer automatics that transmission is a good choice too  It never lets the engine strain and always chooses the right gear quickly and smoothly Performance This car s performance is the most convincing reason to buy it  The sport model s wide low profile tires have superb grip  The car s suspension holds the car down great and it definitely has a European handling flair  The front disc rear drum brakes are excellent and have a great feel to them  The suspension of the V 6 model is definitely stiffer than the base model  though it never feels like your riding in a sports car either  The V 6 engine is far smother than the four cylinder and has a great sound to it s exhaust  The 4 cylinder engine accelerates fairly well  but the V 6 is by far worth the extra money  Interior The interior is the only sore spot of this car  and especially in back  The front seats on the sports model are extremely comfortable and really hold you in place when the going get s rough  The dash was redesigned in 1998 and can still use work  The vent on the passenger s side is positioned awkwardly  and it is hard to get the air direction right  The lower part of the dash houses two very low and shallow cup holders  and a storage shelf that can barely hold a pen  The power window switches are mounted vertically on the door in a position that makes them hard to use  The rear seat is cramped but like the front seat it is very comfortable  The stereo sounds great but the buttons are small and many serve dual purposes that are hard to decipher  Other than those minor glitches the interior is definitely designed for driving and the driving position  seats  steering wheel  and climate control system are excellent Reliabilty Consumer s Reports rates the 1999 contour average  The V 6 is more prone to problems than the four  My friend receives a Contour as her company car and has had an electrical problem  and a recall on the engine mounts  Besides that she is very happy with the car  Overall Anyone in the market for a small car should definitely take a look at the Contour  If the Contour s interior proves to be a problem than take a look at the Mercury Mystique which is basically a Contour but sold by Mercury  The Mercury has a redesigned dash and interior which solve most of the Contour s problems  Why is nobody buying the Contour My guess is the interior  The rear is not sufficient for a family with older children  and the minor details done wrong on the inside affect a person s decision greatly  However  if you re looking for a fun to drive  comfortable  affordable alternative to a Corolla or Saturn the Contour is definitely the way to go     
Pos, As opposed to the the Volkswagon Jetta which I also looked at  this car has plenty of power and at about the same price as many of the foreign counter parts  At about  18 000 you get a well equipped vehicle with a V 6 engine and performance tires to match  Road noise is a little loud and the stereo system leaves a lot to be desired  Overall comfort however is very nice if you are under 6ft 2in  There s plenty of room for 4 large adults and if you not too picky about the stereo system this car makes an excellent all around car  Trunks space  What can I say there s plenty  I put a rack stereo component system  5 units  and a computer  Gas mileage is pretty good however they only put a 13 gallon tank in the car so it seems like you re filling up all the time  I average about 300 miles per tank  So if you re looking for a vehicle that has sports feel both on the road and on the pedal this car is for you  I mean you can feel the road and the steering is easily readable  If you looking for luxury this may not be the car unless you get the leather package with power seats  supreme sound and all the little perks  It s an ideal family car for the small family   wife and two kids  and an excellent singles car that can be used for business or pleasure br br  
Pos, Greetings  What follows is a blow by blow account of a head to head comparison test of the Ford Contour and the Plymouth Breeze  If you own or are thinking of purchasing either of these vehicles  this should prove to be very interesting reading for you  I have toned it down to about 1 300 words  in the interest of not posting a novel here on Epinions com   Earlier today  I found myself with an interesting assignment  to pick which of two cars was the  quot better quot  car  A close friend was shopping for a compact sedan  but she hated the idea of not buying American  After much discussion  mostly related to styling  she narrowed it down to two cars  the Ford Contour and the Plymouth Breeze You see  this all began several weeks ago when my friend s car  a wheezy old 1987 Ford Mustang  was diagnosed as needing a new automatic transmission within the next month or so  The car was driveable  but definitely on the way out  Knowing that I am a  quot car guy quot  she called me up and asked me what she should buy  choosing from only compact  four door North American models that can be bought for well under  20 000  she was thinking  18 000 or less We immediately ruled out the Pontiac Grand Am as she felt the styling was simply too funky for her more conservative tastes  especially the dashboard which appears to have been lifted straight out of a sci fi movie  I actually like it myself  She also ruled out the Ford Focus  as it too struck her as a little too weird  Interestingly  she really liked the looks of the Ford Contour  She also liked the design of the Plymouth breeze  saying that is was definitely  quot neato quot  and was not too weird for her So  having effectively narrowed it down to a used Ford Contour or a Plymouth breeze  we set out in search of a prime example of each  She decided that she would probably be best off to pick up a used 1999 model of the car she chose as this would save her several thousand dollars  you know the scenario  champagne taste  Coca Cola budget So  as luck would have it  after lots of searching for a couple of really clean cars  we happened to find one of each on the same used car lot  a red 1999 Plymouth Breeze with 24 000 miles  and a white Ford Contour with 25 400 miles  Both were automatics  and had power windows  door locks  and mirrors  AM FM cassette stereos  cloth interiors  and 4 cylinder engines  We drove the Breeze first Inside  the Plymouth breeze is deceivingly roomy  There is plenty of room for four 6 foot adults to get comfortable  The back seat even features a nifty fold down and pull out dual cupholder in the back of the front armrest  The opposite was true of the Ford Contour  The back seats are tight for six footers  and rear headroom is non existent  Hitting a nice bump on the freeway would definitely result in the rear passengers bumping their heads on the roof if they were 5 9 quot  or taller  The breeze won that one hands down  It feels much larger from any seating position  even though on the outside it s almost the same size as the Contour The Breeze has the nicer looking gauge cluster  and more in the way of interior storage compartments  Of course  as is typical of Chrysler company products the interior looked and felt like it was put together on a strict  under allocated  budget  The plastics are definitely rental car grade  and the controls do feel unsubstantial and sort of rubbery On the other hand  the Contour was missing something I insist on in any car I drive  a tachometer  Even with an automatic  a tach can be very useful  especially in a car with overdrive transmission  The Contour feels smaller  both in terms of interior space and overall size  Without a doubt the plastics used on the dash are of higher quality than those found in the Breeze  The steering wheel in the Contour scored major points with me for it s thick  meaty feel  Conversely  the steering wheel in the Breeze is nothing special and is immediately forgettable Despite being direct competitors  these two cars feel very  very different  The Breeze feels more like a typical American car in that it feels large and roomy  and it handles like a small boat  Road feel is not a term with which Plymouth is well acquainted  The steering is vague and uncommunicative  leaving the driver feeling like they are driving a small Buick Conversely  the Contour  derived from the hugely successful European Ford Mondeo  offers the driver excellent road feel  For an enthusiast  this makes the drive more fun and makes the car more predictable  inspiring more spirited driving  For the average consumer the Contours excellent steering imparts a feeling of having better control over the vehicle  thus making them feel safer   This elusive trait is why BMWs are known as the  quot ultimate driving machine quot  The road feel in a BMW is quite simply the very best in the world As for power  neither car is exactly a road rocket  but thanks to its superior handling  the Contour feels both faster and much more fun to drive  In all honesty  the Ford felt faster from a standstill  although we obviously did not conduct instrumented testing  The Ford s brakes were definitely better than those in the Breeze  but bear in mind that both were used cars Surprisingly  both cars have great trunks  One would expect the Contour to have a small trunk  and while it s not as deep as that found on the Breeze  it is surprisingly large and usable  Of course  the Breeze s trunk ultimately is the larger of the two One of the biggest subjective differences between these two vehicles is the quality of materials and level of fit and finish  The Ford felt like it was put together very well  in fact  if I may be so bold  it felt downright European  Conversely  the Breeze felt like it was good for maybe another 50 00 miles before it came apart at the seams  The plastics are super cheap  and squeaks and rattles were certainly noticeable  The Breeze left us with the impression that we had driven a cheap car  while the Contour felt like a shoe string budget BMW wannabe  no kidding So  which did we choose  In case you haven t guessed yet  she bought the Contour  We both felt good about the purchase  especially since we negotiated a great deal on the car  She is thrilled  and she especially likes the styling of the Contour  When we took a good long look at it  she felt the Breeze looked like a plastic toy  especially the grill and mirrors  and I must admit that the front end of the Contour is very pleasing to look at  The cat s eye headlamps are very elegant Apparently  the Contour is one of Ford s most reliable products  Time will tell  and I must admit that I am somewhat pessimistic about its projected life span  Of course  it s not a Plymouth  I am not a fan of Chrysler products  so I definitely think she picked the better built car Overall  I was very impressed with the Ford s performance and overall packaging  except the rear seat headroom thing  I had pretty much written Ford off as a manufacturer of below average quality automobiles with little or no finesse  the new Focus excluded  A pleasant surprise  I could actually sort of envision myself driving a Ford product and actually liking it for the first time in years  of course  I would probably opt for the 6 cylinder SVT Contour All in all  the Ford struck me as the better car  I think she choose wisely  Of course  neither car would hold a candle to a used Nissan Altima  Honda Civic  or VW Jetta in my books  But hey  this car wasn t for me  My pal insisted on an American car  and I personally think she got a great set of wheels for her money   br br  
Pos, I was able to drive this car for the past couple of weeks  when me and my brother decided to switch cars  He drove my 98  Mercury Mystique and I drove his 99  Ford Contour  I was very impressed with it s handle on the road and the little added horsepower that the Mystique doesn t have  I ve been driving the Mercury Mystique for the last year and have been pleased with the car  What really surprised me when I started driving this car is how similar it is to the Mystique  The interior is almost exactly the same and the feel of the car is also similar  So with that in mind price should also be compared  We paid about the same for the car  his being a year newer gave him the advantage  I think that Mercury Mystique is a special kind of ford manufacturer so you spend some money on the fact that it is a Mercury Mystique   Things about the car  comes with the nice anti lock brakes for all wheels power windows and door locks I think the Contour is the SVT  and in the 99  models that particular type of Contour has more horsepower 200 to the SE and LX s 125 it has a V6 engine  it has more torque than the other models also miles per gallon  which is  important  now adays  is 20 29  city hwy has cruise control and air bags seats now more than 5 comfortably  it is a very luxurious ride if I may say so it s a safe ride  even though it has more horsepower than the Mystique  the feel when you drive it makes it just as safe  It s hard to explain  other than it feels safe when you drive it brother bought it at about  13 000 I would recommend this car to parents who want a safe and dependable car for their children to drive  Also to people who do a lot of driving to work everyday  it s gets good MPG  Is it better than the Mystique  Even though they are two very similar cars  the added horsepower and cheaper price makes this car a little bit better br br  
Pos, I m publishing this review for those of you who are considering a purchase of any V6 model Ford Contour  I bought a 1999 Ford Contour SVT  Special Vehicle Team  because I like high performance European type vehicles without the high costs usually associated with any Euro model car that fits this description My initial test drive of the 1999 Ford Contour SVT made me smile  which isn t all that easy to do when it comes to cars  I demand a vehicle that can REALLY perform and handle well in the twisties and at the same token  deliver good looks and carry four people with relative ease  I purchased my 1999 Ford Contour SVT new in December of 1998  it is now November of 2000 and I currently have 42k miles on the odo In retrospect  I can give an honest and well experienced review of the pro s and con s of this 4 door performance sedan  If you are on a budget and want a 4 door performance sedan  this is definitely a car to consider  Performance is right up there with most BMW s at a considerably cheaper price  What are the pro s By far the biggest pro is the performance the SVT model offers  but even the non SVT models are good performers for those who don t want to pay the premium attached with the limited production runs that come with all SVT cars  Car and Driver hustled the SVT from a standstill to 60MPH in just under seven seconds  6 9  and through the quarter mile in 15 4 seconds at 91MPH  For those of you unfamiliar with performance statistics  lets just say this 4 door performance sedan will keep right up with almost all V6 sport coupes on the market priced under  30k  and beat quite a few of them in the process  Handling is even better  generating 0 90G s on the skidpad  which means you ll most likely exceed your own personal tolerances well before you approach the car s handling limits  The SVT s front bucket  leather is standard in the SVT models  seats are VERY comfortable and VERY supportive during spirited driving maneuvers  Overall steering feel is excellent  with only mild understeer once the handling limits are reached or slightly exceeded  and the power assist works wonderfully at any speed  As far as the ergonomics go  the trunk is spacious for a car this size  and the controls and gauges are all laid out clearly and easy to use  So what are the con s Mostly fit and finish in the interior areas  I ve also noticed some suspension noises  clunks and rattles  especially during the colder seasons of the year  Interior noise isn t up to par with most cars  even in its own price range  Cup holders are horrible up front  and non existent in the rear  there are inserts that Ford sells that solve the problem up front though  Interior lighting leaves much to be desired  There is no glovebox light  a REAL inconvenience at night to say the least  and no rear passenger lighting exists either  Rear brake noise has been an issue for me personally from time to time as well  Dependent upon whether or not you like it  you may or may not appreciate the exhaust engine noise  Keep in mind this car  and especially the SVT model  is designed with the performance enthusiast in mind  so the exhaust and engine are tuned accordingly  I personally love the growl from under the hood and from the exhaust Overall  I think the V6 1999 Ford Contour s are great contender s in the market segment for which they compete  Unfortunately for me but fortunate for others  the resale value is about average for a Ford vehicle  which means you can get a REALLY good price on slightly  read 1 2 years old  used models that have been well cared for  and even better deals on slightly older models br br  
Pos, I recently spent a week with a 1999 Contour SE on a 3000 mile vacation  When I first picked up the car  I thought that it would be a total drag  I was pleasantly surprised  though  It is a very roomy car with all the features of a more expensive car  The ride quality is excellent and managed 400 miles per tank with a lot of highway driving at speeds of 80mph  Mountainous driving requires manually shifting the automatic to get the most out of the 2 0 4 cyl engine  Braking is sure with no fade  even after driving down a 8  grade for two miles The trunk is large and roomy enough to carry luggage for four  Though billed as a 5 seater  four can sit comfortably  I have also driven V 6 Contours in the past  however the 4 cylinder wil be more than adequate for most peoples needs br br  
Pos, I just purchased a Ford Contour LX  It is a 1999 model  and cost  11 500  I got a great deal considering their was only 9 000 miles on it  At first I was somewhat hesitent to test drive it because it was an automatic  and I usually hate automatics  But after just driving around the block  I was sold  I was amazed at what a great car you can get for so little  I looked at the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camary  but they were both overpriced  The Contour was not only thousands cheaper  but I actually thought it drove nicer than the other two  The in dash CD player produced a sound that make the Camary s radio look like a alarm clock in comparison  The only two complaints I have about the Contour are small  One is that when you pop the trunk  it is a little heavy to lift  Two is that the cup holders are positioned a little too far away from the driver  Two inconviences yes  but not enough to deter a sensible buyer away from this great buy br br  
Pos, This car is a GT Premium  which has 260 horsepower as advertised  It is above the standard model  but it s about  3 800 more than the base model  My  1 recommendation  pay the extra money for the GT if you can  it s worth every penny and then some Power acceleration  The acceleration in this car is quite phenomenal  I m more than happy with it  I ve added an American Thunder cat back exhaust system to give it a really cool growling sound under open throttle  It has more horsepower because of the modification Handling  I am very happy with this rear wheel powered vehicle  Keep in mind this version of the vehicle has 17  performance tires  That surely improves handling significantly above the standard trim level  I ve hugged some tight curves with excellent grip on the road  On dry pavement  the handling is excellent  On wet pavement  care must be taken  Spinning the tires is fairly easy during heavy rain  when accelerating onto a highway  Beware of your usual high speeds when turning in wet rain  and leave plenty of space ahead for braking  Breaking on dry pavement is very good  the 4 wheel anti lock disk brakes had been used in an emergency situation once  with maximum sustained pressure  and they lived up to their expectations  Deceleration from 50 0 on a tight curve was better than expected  Maintenance and Upkeep  After 8 000  I am very happy  There s no major or minor problems to date  Only time will tell  Keeping the zinc yellow clean is more challenging  but it is well worth it  it s an outstanding color and gets noticed  I wonder how long my clutch is going to last  I surely make it suffer when I have fun with the car  It s doing good so far Gas mileage  The gas mileage can average as low as 14 5 MPG during a week with above average traffic problems  I drive about 3 4 city  1 4 highway  and the average MPG per tank goes up to about 17 5 18 when there haven t been significant traffic problems on the commute  Surprisingly  the cruising MPG  averaging about 65 for 1 000 miles  I received 26 27 MPG  That was a pleasant surprise  If you want to take advantage of the full power of with this car  your gas mileage will suffer gt  it s unavoidable  but it s never gone below 14 5 MPG for me Comfort and interior  I m definitely used to the black leather seats and power everything  My dog loves the back seat  If I expected to have 2 or more adult passengers regularly  I would not purchase this vehicle  The rear view mirror is slightly obscured by the spoiler  and the side mirrors are slightly obscured by the body form in the back  it took some getting used to backing up into a parking spot  Climate control is fine  and the 400 watt stereo is very clear at the maximum volume level  which is awesome  The ride is not overly uncomfortable for a sports car  I love the feel of control obtained from a sports car  as opposed to the floaty feel of comfort and luxury vehicles  The road needs to be felt when drying hard and fast Price  The price I paid includes all taxes and fees   24 000 for the GT Premium  that deal was through carsdirect com  which  by the way  provided fine service and stuck to their price  
Pos, The Mustang coupe in premium trim offers a lot for a low price  Present  3k rebates make the car a steal at about  17K  Philosophy moment  Owning a proud American car takes a bit of self esteem  The Camry conformity group will try to co depend you into their faceless society of stellar reliability  It is too dull a life for the expressive and passionate driver Key attributes 193 horsepower  225 ft lbs of torque 225 55 R 16 tires 5 spd with traction control 4 wheel disc brakes with ABS Mach 460 6 disc CD changer 6 way power driver seat Leather wrapped tilt steering wheel From the list above  it is clear you get a lot for your money in the Mustang Coupe Premium  Further  the trim and badging are tasteful  subtle  and true to the Mustang images so familiar to most Americans  Handling is predictable and mild mannered in dry conditions  The goodyear eagle LS tires are surprisingly squeal resistant  This allows pushing the limits without attracting much attention  The brakes are decent  but not on par with Ford s SVT vehicles  They will stop the car  but are not made for the abuse a racing car might see The powertrain  3 8L V6 with 5 speed  is flexible and torquey  As the rpms build past 3500  so does a considerable amount of horsepower  The car will chirp the tires in second and third if you are not smooth with your shifts  The car is happy to cruise at 90 to 100 MPH but is governed to 115 MPH top speed  As a long term member of the 100 MPH club  I can say that this is fast enough to pass 99 99  of the cars on the freeway For this type of vehicle  gas mileage is respectable ranging from 22 to 26 mpg on average  You can do even better on the highway with cruise control  The fit and finish is good  but some interior parts show uneven gaps between panels  There are no squeaks or rattles and the materials seems very robust  By and large  fit could improve but this year s Mustang shows Ford does care about quality  The feel of the car is extremely solid  The gear shifter feels like it is part of the transmission  it is  and the engine seems composed and strong even with the throttle wide open To be objective  there are areas for improvement  Wind noise is noticeable but not excessive  The back seat is not comfortable for adults  And  the rear live axle can occasionally make the back of the car feel a bit sloppy  These gripes withstanding  it is clear that no other car can match the Mustang s equipment  performance  and comfort levels at this price Any questions  Or  are you on your way to the Ford dealer already  Get a Mustang  It will revive your love for driving  Or get a Camry so it can steal your soul  
Pos, I wanted a Ford Mustang Convertible for years  ever since I got my driver s license  When the 95 model came out  I thought it was the most beautiful car on wheels  that I could afford  of course  It had a powerful V8 engine  gorgeous design lines  leather interior  an automatic top so I wouldn t have to wrestle with folding and unfolding some unwieldy thing  it had a glass window in the back  with defroster  so it wouldn t get scratched like a plastic one  It also had a back seat  so I could pack friends or stuff  It was my dream car  I kept it cherry with weekly detailing In 1999 I totalled my dream car because the combination of the huge  high performance 17 quot  tires  and the powerful V8 engine  although a blast to drive on dry pavement  were a disaster in wet weather  I was going below freeway speeds when I hydroplaned  spun out and hit the center divider twice  The air bags deployed perfectly  and although I had to get out and run from the dead car to avoid being hit by oncoming traffic  I was virtually uninjured  Both the front and the back end of the car were smashed and twisted and virtually gone  But I had no trouble opening the door in a hurry  And not only did the airbags save my life  they prevented injury  I had had the car for four years and it didn t have a scratch  Now it was gone  But I was alive I read later  in Consumer Reports  that many people have had similar experiences with the Mustang big tires big engine in wet weather  But that did not deter me from wanting to get another one  It was still the only car for me But the 99 model is ugly  Its lines are no longer powerful  sleek and lovely  but sharp  angular  overly aggressive and masculine  I ve looked at it and looked at it and the design is just repulsive  It s still a Mustang  it s still a great car  but it cannot compare to the look of my 95  I am dismayed that the designers at Ford are again on the downhill slide with the Mustang  In my opinion  the Mustang of the 70 s and 80 s was one sad looking underdeveloped machine  a far cry from the hot  innovative little pony car of its beginning  I hope that the Mustang of the new millennium will not share that fate  Go back to the drawing board  guys   and make it beautiful again  You can make it powerful and hot looking without making it look like a shark  Start with your 94 96 models  I still haven t bought a new car  and the money s burning a hole in my pocket  and I m itchin to feel again the way that car made me feel br br  
Pos, This was the first new car I ever purchased  it was my dream car  My 1995 Ford Mustang 2 Door Coupe was Forest Green with Saddle  tan  interior  The 6 cylinder 3 8 liter  145 horsepower engine was all the power I needed  Sure I would have liked to have had a bigger  beefier engine  but did I need it  No  I have the two speeding tickets to prove it I only had my car a couple weeks and we decided to take it on a  quot road trip quot  up to the mountains  to show it off to my parents  It handled like a dream  with 3 passengers that engine pulled us right up the Sierra Nevada Highways  passing people left and right It was a great commute car  with good gas mileage  I could go a week  traveling 60 round trip miles a day  on one tank of gas  The only draw back for this car was the comfort level for long trips  As long as you were driving it was fine  but the passengers were not as comfy  The head rest on the front seats were to far back to recline and enjoy the ride  The back seat area was small  Only a petite woman could sit back there comfortably for any long period of time We traded in my Mustang for a 1997 Ford Explorer when my due date approached  It was going to be too difficult to get a child in and out of the back seat  Let alone all the  quot stuff quot  that goes with one in the trunk area  I really miss my car  and breathe a sigh of regret every time I see one on the road  Hopefully one day in the future we can get another one  I will bet my daughter would love one when she starts driving Fourteen more years  wonder if I can wait br br  
Pos, Wanna get hold of a fun  fast car  that s fairly good on gas  has a great reputation as an American classic  and holds up well over a five year period  Then the 1995 Ford Mustang is for you I bought my Mustang in Dec  1995  one year after the re designed  Stangs came out  My little champ is a basic model  V 6  3 8L engine  that still performs like the day I brought it home from the stable  It gets good gas mileage  20 city 27 hwy  has great suspension  corners awesome  and has been relatively trouble free  I ve recently turned 80 000 miles by October  1999  A few parts that I ve replaced include tie rod ends  struts  serpentine belt  and tune up parts  just did that myself about 3 months ago  and 4 new tires last year  Other then regular oil changes  there have been no major corrections needed for my Mustang  The engine is top notch  the transmission excellent  a none worse for wear under carriage  relatively rust free exhaust system  and good body still makes for a beautiful ride in this classic car A few cons include limited cab space  I wouldn t recommend this car to people over 6 4 quot   I m 6 2 quot  and the back seat is very cramped  only good for little kids  really  Also  due to the tight suspension  potholes can easily mess up the wheel alignment  I ve corrected this twice in five years     
Pos, Just about 2 years ago  I re entered that oh so wonderful market of used car searching  Having driven a 1990 Bonneville for the last 3 years of my life  I was ready for something a little sportier  Because of insurance  Mustangs  Eclipses  and Cameros were instantly out of the question  At the time  power didn 146t matter to me as much as looks  Finally  I stumbled upon the car that would soon become mine  through the good times AND the bad  It was indeed a 1997 Ford Probe p b Appearence  i Outside  From the start  this was without a doubt the factor that sold me from the beginning  It 146s styling is amazingly intricate  and for it 146s day in age  seemed much more aerodynamic then most of the running competitors  While it didn 146t offer the ground effects or better looking rear bumper then the GT model  it did still sport the same front bumper  However  it disappointingly did not come with premium rims  or even alloy rims at that  It 146s hubcaps were very loosely attached to 14 148 black steelies  and looked like one of the worst designed I 146d ever seen  Its taillight brakelight display pattern was clear  bright  and consisted of a 3rd brake light on the upper border of the hatch window  Pop up headlights were extremely smooth looking at the time  but because of maintenance  became more of a nuisance over a good period of time  It also sported a factory spoiler  which helped to complete the car 146s small  compact design  The trunk helps to tally up yet another plus for the Probe  offering ALOT of space to store move stuff  The back seats could be put down to allow for more room  I was once able to fit a whole 10 speed bike in the back end with no problem at all  and room to spare i Inside  On the inside  it seemed extremely roomy  However  that was before I ever tried to get into the back  which almost didn 146t even exist because of its tight quarters  The upholstery was made of a cheap looking plastic  and appeared to snap into place everywhere  That didn 146t exactly thrill me  but it was going to have to work  The seats  also available in leather  were made of cloth  and provided individual bucket style seating  They were very comfortable  but after a few long trips  I found them to be a little odd in shape and hard on your neck  Mostly because there is no separate headrest to be pulled up or down  It came factory with a cheap tape deck  which I yanked out within weeks of having the car  It 146s wiring was easily noted  and color coated  However  unless you have a work manual telling what you what is what  that doesn 146t really help much  Another huge plus of the car was its overall visibility from the inside  Since it is a hatchback  it 146s comprised of many good sized windows  Because of this small factor  backing up and maneuvering on the road was made simpler and more worry free  In my opinion  the driving display was seemingly a little plain  but has everything that you could need to know while operating the car  Consisting of MPH  RPM  Oil Level  Engine Temp  Gas  and Battery  I found that it got the job done  At night  the display was seemingly a little dark  and only emits but a small green glow  which can be adjusted by the intensity knob  Its single overhead dome light doesn 146t create much light in pitch black instances  but was sufficient enough for the time being i Engine Bay  Under the hood  I found there to be alot more open space then I was expecting  Wiring however was kinda messy  with tons of stray wires running every which way  and appearing in no logical order or pattern  The engine crankcase was based almost directly in the center of the engine bay  and seemed well proportioned for a 4 cylinder  When changing the oil  I immediately discovered that the oil filter was located in a HORRIABLE place  To reach it  you must run your arm almost 3 feet deep in the engine bay  from the bottom up  and this included sliding your arm by the exhaust manifold and piping  BAD idea  Because of its extremely high temperatures  you must let the cat sit on ramps for almost 1 2 hours before you even dare stick your arm up by it  While on the topic of heat  the car 146s engine tends to run extremely hot  While the temperature gauge reads that it 146s in normal range  it is a VERY hot engine  and must be allowed to cool down for a good amount of time before working on    b Engine Stats   The standard engine in the 1997 Ford Probe is a 2 0 liter  16 valve DOHC inline 4 cylinder  While the car is manufactured under Ford 146s name  the engine itself  and most of it 146s components and counterparts are actually produced by Mazda  When I first got my Probe  it purred so quiet that you could hardly hear it running  No sudden drops in RPMs were present  nor spark or engine knock  Now  about 2 years after it was purchased  86K miles at time  I 146ve got 123K on her  and she 146s still running smoothly  Some spark knock has occurred  but is quieted by using plus  89 octane  grade gasoline  Under my experience  the engine is extremely reliable  and has yet to leave me stranded or screaming at my car At the flywheel  it produces 118 horsepower  while it is closer to about 100 horsepower at the wheel  Redlining at 6500 RPM  it 146s apparent that it 146s not a Ford engine  My specific model was a manual transmission  so I found it to be awfully peppy off the line  I also found the engine to be extremely weak and it tended to struggle on just about any hard acceleration applied below the 2000 RPM line  Once you got to about 3500 to 4000 RPM is where the power band begins to kick in  and is short lived to about 5500 RPM  Running the air conditioner takes an extremely dampening toll on horsepower  and appears to make the entire car 146s operating performance more sluggish  While this car does produce a good amount of horsepower and pull for a 4 cylinder  it is by no means a powerhouse  If you 146re looking for that  it might be wise to start elsewhere  If you 146ve got your hopes set on a Probe  I might suggest looking into it 146s more expensive and step up GT model  sporting a 164 horsepower  24 valve Quad Cam V 6 p b Performance Ride Quality   As for road stats  completely stock  my Probe was running about around a 17 8   89 MPH in the   Ford 146s recorded road test records slightly better results  but this is about what you would expect from a 6 year old car  The car 146s governor kicks in at 115 MPH  at right about 5200 RPM  Braking was decently quick  responsive and smooth  However  my car was not equipped with the optional ABS  Anti lock Brake System  so i 146m not really able to comment on that aspect  Turning and cornering was yet another strong point for the car  making it extremely maneuverable  As mentioned previously  teamed up with its excellent level of visibility  it makes for a very easy and effortless driving experience when weaving in and out of traffic  However  because the large amount of glass  fogging of the windows can start to become a problem  Especially during the wintertime  you may find yourself waiting  and waiting  and waiting even longer  just for your windows to defog When it comes to gas mileage  the Probe does put forth an extremely good effort  Stats for the car read 25 in town  and 29 on the highway  My person findings have been must better  On the average  I 146ll normally get about 29 miles in town  and almost a whopping 35 MPG on the highway  Cruising on the highway creates a very comfortable and smooth ride  ranging the smoothest from 45 to 95 MPH  However  another negative you that may very well hear from multiple Probe owners is the infamous rattling sound coming mostly from the back hatch area  While other rattles are present  the most obvious by far would be from the back  I 146ve tried multiple times to find out exactly what it is that caused this  and have yet to come up with an answer  Also  while on rattles  the windows start to come into play  Since they are rimless windows  they don 146t have a base  or track that they follow when rolled down  Because of this  even when rolled all the way down  they tend to rattle inside the door  This can be fixed  but requires taking the door apart to apply  147buffers 148 along the windows path p b Options   The 1997 Probe  like any other car  could come fully loaded  or bare to the bone  Some of the available options are as follows  Power Seats  Power Windows  Power Door Locks  Power Mirrors  Powered Sunroof  ABS  Anti lock braking system  4 Wheel Disk Brakes  Premium Sound System w equalizer  Spoiler  Premium Wheels  or Alloys  Rear Window Wiper  Ground Effects  Side Airbags  Keyless Entry  Cruise Control  Fog Lights  Leather Seats  Sports Suspension and Intermittent Wipers If fog lights were not included on your model but are desired  you will be happy to find that the harnesses for it 146s wiring was still ran through the car  making it easy to plug the factory fog lights button up to custom fog lights  Swapping out the factory Tape CD Tuner is made very simple because of its economy standard sized opening  which requires no special harnesses  Many of the other options can be added as well  rather it be by use of aftermarket parts  or even managing to find order original factory parts from Ford   Prices   At the time I bought my Probe  you could find most of the 1997 models ranging anywhere between  3000 to  7000 depending on mileage  shape  and overall condition  However  since then  there has apparently been a drop in the marketing price  and the prices have dropped through the floor  If you keep your eyes peeled  you could pick up a great steal for right around  3000 4000  However  when taking in account of the car  you had best put a good amount of money aside  because this car has been known for it 146s expensive repairs p b Repairs   Within months of owning the car  I was sadly introduced to the number one gripe of owning a Probe  Prices tend to be 2 3 times as much as they would be on say a Taurus  or Escort  Reason for this would most likely be because when the Probe came out  it had a very rare set of tools that were needed to work on it  Since it 146s a Ford Mazda hybrid  it was a total mess when it came to trying to using tools for only Fords  or only for Mazdas  Also  it 146s not exactly considered a plus that this car was discontinued  much less that the 1997 model was the  147farewell 148 year model  Since 1997 was the last year the Probe was produced  in the US  many loose ends and problems were left unsolved and fixed  It is because of this reason that even Ford dealerships aren 146t able to answer some of the problems that tend to occur p b Overview   After all is said and done  it all comes down to personal preference and choice  Would your money be best invested in this Mazda Ford discontinued hybrid  or spent it elsewhere  Well  that 146s really for you to decide  In my personal opinion  I am planning on sticking with Probe until it 146s end  However  if you are looking to a Probe  don 146t make the same mistake I did  Maybe the 4 cylinder model is perfect for you  and gas mileage means much more then performance  But if you 146re in the run for more power and somewhat upgraded or better styling  you might wanna slip into a GT  It obviously would prove to be much quicker and yield more power in about every aspect  But when it all comes down to  I can 146t completely rip on the Probe too much  because it has got me from here to there with some style  and has never left me stranded  While repairs can range from pricey to ridiculous  the car itself is almost more of a mystery then anything  The final standing question would be if you 146re willing to give this enigma a chance  
Pos, My wife bought this car 4 years ago  Jan 97  and we use this car as our  around town  car  Other than tires  oil and brakes we have never had this car in the shop  This car has held up through long road trips  cramming with luggage and a couple of small fender benders We like this car because of its looks as well as its design The controls are all in easy reach of the driver and passenger  We have the 5 speed  which for a car in this price range  is surprisingly agile The car could use bigger tires and wheels to help it stick to the road  but the suspension is good and firm in most turns  We have the 4 cyl engine  which is not the most powerfull engine  if you like this car but want power  get the  GT The engine is a high revving engine that most people can have some fun with  All in all a good car for the money  Would be suitable for a teenager   the gas mileage is great  the car is reliable and it has dual air bags  
Pos, This 1989 Ford Probe is a sporty and spunky little car  It is reliable and always ready to run  My 1989 Ford probe has 212000 miles on it to date  I have had very little trouble with the engine  It blew a timing belt but when replaced it ran great  This problem was my fault  as I was aware that timing belts should be changed periodically The 1989 Ford has quick pick up with the turbo engine and it gets in and out of traffic with little trouble  The paint has held up very well for an eleven year old car  It is fun to drive but watch out for tickets  It gets good gas mileage even at this late stage  It continues to get 29 miles to the gallon and the spark plugs have not been changed in 2 years  The air conditioner has been the only problem and that is because there no protection in the grille  It is very easy to get a rock in the condenser  This can be eliminated by putting in a screen to protect the condenser  I would rather have this little stick shift model then a new one  I believe the 1989 Probe will be considered a classic in later years and I am going to hang on to this one  This is the car for someone who likes the sporty look likes the feel of a car  is interested in reliability and value and may want to keep it for future appreciation     
Pos, My husband recently traded our 1996 B4000 Mazda for a 4 door Ranger V 6XLT 4wd  We loved the Mazda but it was getting lots of miles on it and wanted something new  The Mazda and Ford are the same vehicle basically and we knew we had good luck with the Mazda for years The controls are exactly the same  and I mean exactly  This is fine since everything is laid out well and is good quality  Several things have changed on the inside like the steering wheel is a little thicker which is more comfortable  This truck has 4 doors  but not full size doors that make you lose bed space  They make it easier to store things behind the seat as well as being easier for passengers to get into the back  The back is still not the most comfortable spacious ride  but it s okay for short trips  I personally don t like the seats sitting sideways in the back as it can make you feel sick on twisty roads  but we don t use them much We had one bold break and one loosen frequently on the armrest in the Mazda  They have since added bracing on both sides of the armrest which makes it much more sturdy  There is also an airbag turn off switch for when you need to have children ride up front  He got the single CD stereo which has very good sound and easy to read buttons The biggest and best change is the engine  It s the same size but more HP with more get up and go  It s also geared differently  manual  where you can be in a higher gear at a lower speed which has been a good thing with all of the snow and ice we ve had  The 4wd is great and can take you anywhere you want to go  It rides like a truck because it is one  but the ride in the new one is much tighter and takes the bumps a whole lot better One thing I don t like is the programmed keys  They are  25 plus  25 for programming if you have them do it  We bought 3 extra keys and programmed our own but it was pretty scary because we didn t want to mess it up and have to have it towed 40 miles to the dealer  It was pretty easy though  It s supposed to make it harder for thieves and is considered an alarm system It s a good truck that has been relatively unchanged for many years which shows that it is an idea that works No new trucks seem to come with a bedliner and I m quite sure why seeing how expensive the trucks are and they save the paint  We got a bedliner installed by them and it s very nice br br  
Pos, I love it  My truck has a great look and definitely turns heads  I trade in a 95 Ford Explorer Sport 4x4  I have to tell you that I already miss the full back seat My two daughters like riding in the back but I can tell the novelty will soon wear off  The Explorer had more power and the turning radius was much better  however at 83000 miles the gas mileage was horrible I went to the Dealership with the intention of buying a new Ford Explorer  however  the 30  sticker sent me looking for something cheaper  I looked at the new Sport and Sport Track but like it s big sister the price with options put it near 30k  Too much for a car in my opinion  I immediatly noticed the truck on the showroom floor  It looked very tough and extremely Sporty  Be advised I am a 36 yo white collar professional not an 18 yo looking to buy his first truck The salesman was steering me toward the new Escape yuk  The Escape is boring inside and out  I kept going back to the Ranger  After a long solo test drive I was sold  The wind noise is average  The Nissan I test drove was much worse  Take offs from traffic lights are more than adequate  The internal controls are easy to reach and attractive  I opted for the 6 disc in dash CD player  It reacts a little to slow for my taste but the sound is clear it makes highway driving fun  I play music loud and cannot hear anything going on outside the truck  I especially like the way Ford increased the Ranger s height  It sits at the same level as the Explorer Overall I recommend the Ranger Extended Cab 4x4 4 0 V6  It handles well and does great off road  The stylish improvements and interior do a great justice to this Truck  If you are in the market for a small SUV or pick up try this out in your search  You will not be disappointed  It matched the foreign competition in every way except was typically 3 5000 thousand dollars cheaper  Good luck  
Pos, Real Truck people know who 146s got it in the compact class  most would agree  147nobody but nobody 148 can touch Ford 146s Ranger  Although the Japanese may have an advantage in car sales they remain on the outside looking in when it comes to trucks  GM has never been a serious contender with the S 10 and Dodge is only starting to make some inroads with the Dakota  Quite simply  none match the build quality Ford puts into the Ranger For instance  I drove my last Ranger  a 1989 2WD for 13 years before recently upgrading to a slightly used 2001   4X4 Supercab Edge  During my ownership covering 110 000 miles I replaced one set of brakes and shocks  did one tune up  replaced a leaky valve cover gasket  several mufflers  two batteries and a water pump  Basically just routine maintenance  quite a record for any vehicle  especially one that cost just  9 000  For those of you that may not know  the Edge series comes with fewer goodies than the top of the line XLT  It lacks some of the finer things you 146d consider indispensable in an automobile such as tilt  power windows and locks  keyless entry etc  However this model was exactly what I was looking for as it contains a hose me out interior  The extra room the 4 door cab offers is great for hauling around my constant companion  a German Shepherd named Barney  Barney seems to have 3 times more hair than any dog his size would require  most of which he 146d leave behind where it would stick fast to the seats and carpeting of the previous truck  The Edge with its vinyl floor and seats  is one heck of a lot easier to vacuum and keep clean  And after all  this is a truck  not the family go to Sunday meeting luxury vehicle Having said that I must admit I was somewhat disappointed with our test drive of this vehicle  For one thing there was more engine noise and a much choppier ride than in my far older 2 wheel drive truck  The difference was very noticeable  so much so  we went home without purchasing the truck  much to the chagrin of our sales person I guess we just weren 146t prepared for the difference you 146ll find between the 2 wheel version and its bigger  147at least taller 148 4X4 brother  After some discussion my wife and I decided even though we preferred the 2 wheel suspension  a 4X4 would be better suited to our current needs  Point being if you don 146t live in snow country  unless you 146re into status that is  you 146ll be a lot more comfortable in a 2 wheel model  Here you 146ll find easier entry  since it 146s lower to the ground  in addition to a much softer ride Of course serious truck lovers wouldn 146t consider anything but a 4X4  why because they 146re macho  They just look bigger and meaner with their taller stance and huge tires  Often owning a 4X4 is all about image  not necessarily need  Maybe some of that was true with us too as the Edge 4X4 is one mean looking vehicle  It just says  147drive me 148 when sitting in our garage I consider the 3 0 V 6 sightly undersized  especially since the truck is rated to haul up to 5 000 lbs  can 146t help but wonder where they got that number  Ford must have known that because newer models come with the 4 0  a 50 HP boost  as standard equipment  Although the smaller engine is adequate for most needs and probably does better at the pumps  Gas mileage is in the 16 17 range  not exactly outstanding The fun to drive aspect is hard to measure  Ride is toward the harsh side  but the truck handles incredibly well and doesn 146t feel the least bit tippy unlike many SUV 146s  Seats are very comfortable  wind noise is minimal  I have noticed some creaking noises  undoubtedly attributable to the 4 door design that lacks the stabilizing nature of a center post  As noted earlier the vinyl interior of the Edge makes cleanup a breeze  Nevertheless it does make one wonder why Ford had to pad the seat backs with a velcro like cloth that nearly defeats the clean ability feature for dog lovers  The Ranger is literally bullet proof from a mechanical standpoint  Combine that with its good looks  rugged suspension  right size  flexible utility and fun to drive aspect  you have one heck of vehicle  It can haul wood  cruise effortlessly on the highway or carry campers through some of the worst terrain without taking a deep breath  And it retains its value better than 90  of all the other vehicles on the road  No wonder it 146s the number one selling compact truck  it sure gets my vote  
Pos, We live on a farm and purchased a big truck in order to pull a horse trailer to transport our horses  cows and or sheep as well as haul feed for them  I buy a ton at a time  We also needed it to pull a car trailer for our antique and classic car collection  At first I was intimidated by this monster of a truck  being a small woman  But once you get used to it I think anyone would enjoy driving this truck  It has a lot of power and rides very smooth  It handles very nice and makes you sit up so tall you can t help but to feel powerful  Ours has a v 10 in it and I wouldn t want anything less  I really like the power br br  
Pos, We recently purchased a new Ford F 150 Super Crew for the reason that we wanted a truck  We looked at the Dodge Ram  the Dodge Dakota  and the Ford Ranger  The F 150 was the most comfortable and economically sized  When we decided to test drive  the ride was smooth and quiet  All controls were perfectly situated for an easy ride  That was when we decided that the F 150 was what we wanted  Since then  I have been more than happy with our purchase  We have taken it with us on long road trips and even had to sleep in it which made for an accurate night of sleep  I was impressed with the comfort I felt that the F 150 had made during the long drive  I highly recommend this truck  
Pos, I own a 96 two tone  North Woods limited edition Ford Ranger whats so limited bout it  I don t really know  its a 2 3liter 4 banger w  a stick  five overdrive  standard cab  long bed  Though I wish it was the otherway around  ext  cab  short box  Not enough leg room  and it doesn t have tilt  I heed you this  Dont get a Ford Ranger that doesn t have tilt steering  Thou can be dealt w  but gets frustratting on long trips  Overall seating is ahh well I guess comfortable for short rides but w  standard cab your bound to feel confined after an hour or longer trip  trust me I know  And I m not that tall either  at 5 10 quot  my knees start to bother me on long hauls  due to not so perfect seating arrangment  No  its not the clutch either  that I would add is very controled and perfectly calibrated  Not to hard or to mushy  just right feel  and very strong  even after one hell of a rigorois beating of tryin to sport the damn thing and revin up the r s to a point of redline and popping the clutch numerios times if I may add too  even after 41k miles  feels just the same as new  exactly the same  actually better due to break in  Brakes extremely well even though only has front anti lock  chassis settles very well and keeps comepletely controlled under exteme hard braking  manueverabititly well  Very well built  no problems at all Stong frame that can take much streess when pushed hard  can handle heavy loads very well  obvios engine lag and clutch stress but never seems to be a problem  Ya gotta consider  its only a 4 and its not built for speed or much power either  But is indeed an all around very trustworthly truck  Interior wise again  96 was the year that Ford transferd over to the more streamlined sexy looking interior all rounded off and flashier looking  Not enough elbow room left side     door side  seats pushed to close to door to make more room between seats  don t like that  Good visibility for instumentation  Very easy to use and explanatory fuctions make truck easy to drive  Like the rear cargo light  that isn t available on the S 10  so thats a plus for ford  but would like the option to have it on a separate swith  they come on w  the interior when turning on interior light which isn t to bad thou  Biggest disapointment  again the leg room on standard cab  The truck as a whole isn t all that aerodynamically designed or looking  but there isn t much road noise anyhow  Long bed accomates enough space  thou wish bed was just at least a bit deeper  Rear tailgate good weight  not to heavy  and not to light to bounce around on freeway when open either  Good overall road site   though having tilt would allow more over the hood  has great lighting for night driving  Thou one thing I dont like about fords new design of the wind shield wiper blade speed is that everytime you use the blinker  you can t help but to hit it and accidently change it  it being located right on the outside of the blinker lever  Thats where I give props to chevy  having the dial in the middle of the lever  0 60  with stick isn t all that bad w  no load  but can t sustain high speed cruise over 90 95 for the life of it  Winter months w  out any weight in the back totally suck here in MI w  all the snow we get  if you live in a snow climate  i d strongly advise 4WD  It looks better for the trucks anyways  the big tires  high stance  its speaks RANGER  4 banger s good on gas  but if you crave power  then its the 4 0 that you need w  out a doubt  Its a good starter truck  thats really all to it Anyquestions feel free to E mail at Tama1000 hotmail com br br  
Pos, We went to a dealership where a friend worked  so we knew that we wouldn t be  quot taken quot  for a ride  And we looked and looked  wanting an extended cab  4x4 pickup with Air conditioning  But in our price range the extended cab was out of the question  amp  hard to find  So we ended up with a 1993 4x4 Pickup with A C and cruise control  It had 35K miles on it when we got it in 1996  amp  it has been great to us  It has bucket seats with a little  quot bench quot  type seat between them so that our daughter can sit in the middle  It drives very nicely  amp  isn t all that bad on the gas mileage  We haven t had to use the 4x4 feature that often  but when we have it has met or exceeded our expectations all the time  One thing I really like about the 1993 model is that the body style is so similar to the current style that many times people think our truck is New  Kind of nice that Ford hasn t changed the body style much over the last few years We haven t put that many miles on the truck in the 4 years we have had it  since it is our second vehicle  but we hope that will help preserve the value of the vehicle     
Pos, My  93 Ford Ranger is a great truck to own  It has over 90 000 miles on it  is running great  and has had no major repairs or service done on it other than regularly scheduled tune ups and replacing the tires  Although hard core off roaders might prefer the 4WD model  unless you live in the outback the 2WD is much more practical and economical  The engine is a large straight 4 cylinder with decent power and it shows no signs of needing any repairs any time soon  It has had no problems towing small camping trailers or being heavily loaded with items like pianos and couches when I helped my uncle and aunt move  and so it s a very practical truck to have  Plus  it s not as large and unwieldy as most other pickups that are a pain to park or that you would worry a lot about in underground parking  I enjoy driving it  but I try to keep too many people from finding out that I own it or I end up having to help people move all the time  I guess that just comes with the territory in owning a pickup truck My only complaints are 1  It could use a little more power for the big hills I live in a mountainous area so it would be nice to still be able to accelerate up those steep hills rather than just maintaining my speed  but like I said  it has decent power  2  I wouldn t mind a little more passenger space at the expense of a little cargo room  but then again  I m 6 7  so it should be fine for most people As far as towing and hauling  this truck actually rides better when it s loaded down  If you do want the extra power  at the expense of a little gas mileage  go for the V6 model rather than the 4 cylinder  It just depends on your needs preferences  
Pos, I 146ve had my  14686 Ranger since 1996  I bought it for  700 and consider it a great investment  I 146m a contractor on the side  a salesman full time  One of the first rules of business is to keep expenses down and profits up  Sales have been slower lately but are building up again  I stay busy doing jobs smaller than most guys take on but no matter the economy I cringe at the thought of covering a new truck payment every month  Why pay someone else money I made  Let 146s see  buy new truck and throw money away  I do electrical  plumbing  dry walling  tile work and more  This truck has been great for all of it  Tax deduction  I 146ve two great tax deductions I get to tuck into bed at night when I 146m not out on a job late  Then I 146d also rather spend some time with my tax deductions  girl in 1998 and boy in 2001  rather than running ragged all the time  I 146ve got about 130 000 miles on this little critter and figure I 146ll drive it until it falls apart around me  One day I 146ll close the door and the thing will disintegrate into a cloud of dust  I 146ll rummage through it and pick out my tools  I do believe the next work truck will be a van  though  But  off topic One of the first things I had to do was have the exhaust system replaced    300 for the whole thing  Another  200 for a topper   I was ready to go to work and not letting the entire neighborhood when I came   went This never was a beautiful truck  It was originally dark brown with a tan interior  But now the rust has given it a two tone color scheme  The only body panel that has not been eaten away at least partially by rust is the hood  All the wheel wells are slowly expanding  The right pivot point for the end gate has fallen off  I found it and have it on a shelf in the garage  Believe it or not  I 146d rather drive this than a new truck  I never worry about door dings in the parking lot at Lowe 146s Menard 146s Home Depot  I cut shingles on the hood and use the side panels to knock concrete out of my mixing trough  Why  Because I can   it 146s convenient  Nothing I do to this truck will reduce its value at all because it is far from the showroom Nor has this truck ever been considered powerful  The 2 3L engine is sufficient to keep it moving with traffic  but not to pull anything large and continue to do so  I 146ve driven from Des Moines to Chicago with it to do a basement finish for my brother in law and even in Chicago traffic I was able to hold my own  I 146m never  147chosen 148 at stop lights but people give me room when I signal I 146m changing lanes  I think other drivers see the rust and are afraid that if they get too close it 146ll jump onto their car  too  A POX ON YE  Fine Once when I rented a lift and was backing it into position up a driveway  the clutch began smoking  A lot  It  150 the clutch not the smoke   lasted another year or so until I could barely make it up my own driveway  So  I dropped the transmission   with someone who knew what they were doing   and replaced the clutch for about  300  The mechanic who does the work on my car quoted me about  750  I hate paying retail  The only issue I 146ve had with the interior noise level  150 it 146s tolerable even at Interstate speeds  150 was on that trip to Chicago  I turn the radio up to cover the engine noise  Even though I say it is tolerable  that doesn 146t mean you can hold conversation with a passenger  I 146d also noted a great deal of wind noise from the passenger door and could see daylight through the top seal  So  at the next rest area I stopped and tweaked the door a bit  It wasn 146t quite enough  So at the next exit I tweaked it again  Harder  That tightened the door to the point that it 146s difficult to open  But  the wind noise is gone  I like the bench seat  It really is comfortable  Compared to the seats in my sales car  2000 Taurus  it is very comfortable  On the longer trips it doesn 146t limit you with bolsters or even attempt to cradle you  It just supports you and does this job very well  I keep my cordless drill   Sawsall in the space behind the seat  I 146ve also mounted a first aid kit behind my head over the seat  It hangs down over the window but doesn 146t obstruct the view  Since the seat doesn 146t have whiplash protection  the first aid kit has a dual use  Perhaps someone will encourage me to purchase a newer vehicle someday by rear ending this truck  It wouldn 146t take much so I hope they 146re gentle The rear view mirror sought new employment one day out of the blue  It came groveling back from under the seat and now sits close to the end gate pivot in the garage  The view out the back is limited by stuff in the topper anyway  I 146ve quite a lot of tools neatly boxed in those cheap  plastic 50 gallon bins  They keep the tools out of sight and small parts easy to find  I 146ve tested the payload capacity a few times too many  The tires have been the only suspension on the rear at least a couple of times   once with a too large load of shingles and the second with a way too heavy tree trunk  A couple of other times since then I 146ve had the rear bumper drag on the way out the driveway  It doesn 146t take as much as it used to to do that  The right front brake hangs up once in a while  I believe I need new calipers but don 146t feel like dropping the money into the truck and don 146t have the time to spare anyway  I just avoid using the parking brake and things work fine  The windshield is cracked from a large extension ladder being strapped to the roof of the truck  I just laid it over the top of the topper and roof of the truck and strapped it down in the front and back  It caused a bit of stress on the roof and some cracks developed  Iowa doesn 146t have laws concerning cracked windshields so I 146ll let it go until it becomes a problem  I carry the ladder very rarely as it looks like a hook   ladder truck coming down the road  Well  perhaps more like a tight contractor who won 146t spring for a ladder rack The windshield wipers don 146t like to be too cold  If the day is under freezing they need some time for the engine to warm them up a bit  Not a huge deal  Most old trucks have a quirk or two  this one just has a dozen or so  A more annoying thing is that when the humidity is high or especially if there 146s been heavy dew  the truck is very reluctant to start  I 146ve replaced the starter twice  The first time was because it was worn out  The second time because a damaged flywheel was actually the culprit the first time  The second time I opted for the biggest starter that would fit in there  Teamed with an oversized battery what 146s  147reluctant 148 for me may be  147not at all 148 for someone else  I don 146t know  I 146ve also noted a lot of leaves end up in my vents  Then  occasionally the blower shreds them fine enough that they blow out but normally I need to dig them out  I gave up and tore the vent louvers off the dash  Now the leaves just blow whole out of the chute while I 146m driving down the road  Just wait until this winter when the heater really gets going  Picture flaming leaves 133 Anyway  the vent louvers have joined the collection on the shelf in the garage This may be related to the leaf thing  but when it rains I 146ve noticed that the floor on the passenger 146s side is wet  I just make certain anything that I put on the floor isn 146t going to be damaged by moisture  copper fittings   small bins of screws  I 146ve had a couple of cardboard boxes disintegrate with a couple of pounds of screws in them before I began to watch what I keep there  The bed has taken a great deal of abuse but looks pretty good  I found a bed mat in a garage I was working on one time that a previous owner had left  It keeps those plastic bins from sliding around as much  It 146s also a bit more comfortable than the metal when crawling up to reach the bin with the power tools   That 146s why I 146d like to go to a van when this truck gives up the ghost The radiator or a hose has developed a small leak  I 146m hoping it 146s a hose or clamps myself  Three cans of stop leak and it slowed down a bit more  Reflecting upon that it 146s probably the water pump  I notice this leak better in the winter as when the water mix gets too low in the radiator it doesn 146t reach the heater core and the cabin blower blows cold air  Otherwise the heater works great  You could almost scald tender skin on the hottest setting  I 146m not certain what tender skin you 146re thinking of 133 No A C but I grew up without A C and am generally fine without it when dressed in grubby clothes  On really bad days I just knock off early  You can 146t work on a roof or in an attic when it 146s that hot anyway and if you 146re in an A C controlled house or a basement then you 146re golden  150 so to speak anyway  working in the dark I get rather pasty I think the carpeting is after market  At least it looks like it  Not very well fitted either  Heck for  700 you think you 146d get something a bit better  eh  The shifter knob for the five speed transmission has fallen off a few times  No doubt from that blistering acceleration  No threading on the lever or in the knob so I wrapped electrical tape around the lever and pounded the knob onto it  No problem  Many items on this truck seem ready to jump ship  I 146m not certain why  Electrical tape fixes many things  not as well as duct tape  but I 146m more of an electrician  not a heating   air guy The dash holds note pads  gloves and assorted ends well  The blowers also contribute an odd leaf or two  There 146s a nice bin above the glove that is at least as big as the glove box itself and that is great for the smaller things I don 146t need in my pouches but need to have along  The glove box is the tip out variety and doesn 146t hold much  It also doesn 146t always want to stay closed  On harder bumps it will fall open and try to steal items from the bin above it  It takes two or more tries to get it to stay closed again  Even while closed it looks like it 146s threatening to open  A cautionary glance stops it but it seems to be muttering to itself even as it stays closed  Insurance and licensing are almost silly   50 per year for registration   240 per year for decent insurance coverage  Again  one of the first rules of business is to keep expenses down and profits up  This truck does it well When I was an employee  we had most everything delivered  This truck was more than sufficient  Now that I work on my own  I 146ve learned that I personally need something that can carry a bit more  A   ton or one ton van would be right  Would I recommend this to you  I guess you need to evaluate what you 146re going to use it for and what you 146re willing to put up with  I 146m out to impress exactly no one  Now  if you need more cargo room  more tonnage  towing power I 146d certainly get something else  If you want a good solid truck to occasionally take a new bed home for yourself or your neighbors  then this truck is plenty  You won 146t catch too many new truck owners hauling dirt or garden manure in their new truck  I 146ve no qualms The decision is  of course  up to you  
Pos, My  93 Ford Mustang finally gave up the ghost at the most inopportune time  right before my Spring Break trip to Paris  Not about to lose the second trip of a lifetime  see my review of Belfast for the first  I scoped the Eiffel Tower before coming back and dealing with reality  Fortunately  my Ford dealer pulled a mess of strings  and  ta da  I was driving home from Houston  another long story  in my new 2000 Ford Ranger Of course  you ll run your usual gamut of Ford  anagram for Fix or Repair Daily  putdowns  but the Mustang  yep  even the recently deceased  has always been an old reliable for me  and there was just something about the Ranger that made me want to go for it  I wouldn t open a hauling company with one  but other than that  this baby will tote whatever you like down the highway without the excessive fishtailing you see in similar economy pickups  It s got about six feet of bedroom that will allow you to flag any oversized loads comfortably without expecting a pork wagon to pull you over  As I said  it also handles well enough  but don t get happy and make any fancy moves out there or you ll be picking junk up off the road as a result  Inside the cab is a foldaway armrest which acts as an extra stash for CD s  your tape player  guns or whatever  It s a nice place to prop your elbow when alone  and will gladly make room for your Special Someone to cuddle up  The cushy seats also pull back enough to take advantage of what you will find to be an unreal amount of space  Hey  I fit my briefcase  a full semester of textbooks  a crowbar  a six pack of hard lemonade  baseball caps and dozens of assorted papers back there so you couldn t even see it  I don t know if those seats are gonna take that kind of abuse in 2006  but I won t bet against it  The vinyl steering wheel is starting to wear a bit  but the upholstery is standing up well  and the seats look like they re ready to go quite a few rounds It comes with a cool speaker system  and for a few bucks your car stereo dealer should be able to hook up something that ll make your cab come alive  Also  it s got a hideaway spare and jack that hasn t seen the light of day  CAUTION  this baby came with squeaky Firestone radials that haven t popped yet  but I m planning to swap them someday real soon and so should you All in all  this is a good looking  dependable little ride that will haul your stuff around smoothly for some time to come  Keep your oil changed regularly  drop a few bucks for upholstery cleaning once in a while  and the Ranger will reward you with reliable performance and low maintenance that you will long appreciate  
Pos, I m semi retired and about to retire shortly so I wanted to find a vehicle that would serve my needs  I decided to buy my 2000 Ford Ranger XLT LWB after I looked at the competition  My desire was to get a truck to haul lumber home for special projects the LWB is 7  long  carry my big RC model airplanes to from the field  drive something that was economical to run  my 2 5 ltr 4 cyl w  automatic  amp  overdrive gets 24MPG  The seating room is better then my old 87 chevy C10 PU I sold a few years ago  I am overweight and felt that I might have to get one with a supercab but the regular cab fits me just fine  It rides just fine with a load of lumber but is a bit bouncy  as they all are  on poor roads  The only option I added was a tarp cover that fits over the bed and rests on 4 arched aluminum rails to allow rain to run off My truck also is helpful on trips from the nursery with loads of mulch  lots of plants or moving a few appliances for neighbors This is Not a truck to pull a big boat or trailer nor does it have the HP or torque to carry big loads like a full size truck but it works just fine  Like any pickup caution must be used when driving in snow ice  I looked at trucks from all the manufacturers and had 2 basic needs  good milage and something I would enjoy driving  I found both in this truck and recommend it to any one going on a fixed income and yet wants to have a certain amount of flexability in their vehicle br br  
Pos, My boyfriend owns a 1992 Ford Ranger and he loves it  He generally has bad luck with cars  and after his second car  a mustang  broke down  he decided it was time for a new car  I begged him to purchase a truck  because I think they are great  When he pulled up in his green truck  I fell in love  It is so nice  It has a nice sized bed and is perfect for those people who do not need a full sized car or a huge truck  It has nice pick up and is pretty fast  It has never given him any problems  It handles good in the rain or snow  This is a perfect truck for teens and people without families or people with one child  I said that this truck is very roomy  even in back  because there is no option that says   quot Very roomy  no back seat quot     
Pos, I bought my  92 Ranger back in Dec of  91 right off the showroom floor  It was just a bit above factory standard  amp  cobalt blue  my fav  color  I was on leave from my Air Force technical training course and was about to be shipped off to Offutt AFB  I needed a truck that could handle a 500 mile trip without breaking this little airman s wallet 04 25 00 Here s some requested information about the engine  2 3 liter  100 h p  4 cylinder As I stated earlier the truck was cobalt blue  here s the rest of the info  XLT  2 wheel drive  5 speed manual transmission  4 cylinder  standard sound system  All said and done it cost me  9500   2 9  financing  over 5 years  I had this truck until 1999  when I upgraded to an F 250  During that time I had only one thing that went wrong  The cellenoid sp  freaked out twice and I had to jump the posts to get the truck to turn over  I also had two factory recalls  Recall 1  A bad seal in the drivers door that might cause the door to open suddenly if water seeped in and froze  Recall 2  A faulty oil pump  I loved this truck  It was small enough that it was able to get 28 MPG on the highway and wasn t a nightmare to park  while still being big enough to haul around things like queen size mattresses with no problem  This truck is a great  quot first truck quot  and is also great for people who need a truck that gets great gas mileage  My one complaint about the Ranger  and Ford trucks in general  is the location of the spare  I had a flat once and I had to drag myself under the truck to get the spare off  it should be a bit easier than that br br  
Pos, Every family needs a truck at one point or another  My family has personally retired four trucks in the last 8 years  When shopping  we look for something that gets good gas mileage  requires low maintenance  and is comfortable to ride in  We ve had a Chevy  a Dodge  and a GMC  but once we got our first Ford  we found out what driving a truck is all about  The Ranger has a good size bed for hauling  a strong enough motor to tow just about anything  and all the amenities you get from a car  Ranger s with the extra cab and jump seats are especially nice for families with young children  Part and repair on the Ranger are very reasonable  not that I have had to repair anything  My truck gets about 22 miles to the gallon  which is good for a truck  Being a woman  I am always looking for a reliable car  I don t want to deal with repair work  I want to feel protected even in a small truck  I want to know that I won t break down in the middle of no where at night  In my Ranger  I have all the securities I am looking for  It has duel air bags  with a shut off switch for the passengers side  Adjustable shoulder belts allow anyone to wear the seat belt comfortably  Anti Lock Breaks allow me to drive the California Freeways without fear  Reasonable price and easy on the insurance  the Ford Ranger is the best small truck on the market br br  
Pos, Is it even possible for FORD to make a good auto  Hey it could happen  Model Info  2000 Ranger Edge Price Paid  20000 Strengths  Looks  4 0L engine  power  Edge styling  ride  great CD  Weaknesses   Interior doo dads   No map pocket on back of seats  no vanity mirror  no map lights  You must get the 6 the 2 5L cant pull anything  My dome light sensor makes the light stay on   Not after the hammer  They replaced it 3 times until my warranty ran out  Now I have no lights and a lil red light on my dash that always stays on  That has been the worst mechanical problem for me  I have replaced most Ford s OEM Air  fuel and suspension parts  They are to weak to have fun with  All I can say is I hate dealerships  I will never have another car of mine worked on at one  The people they hire are usless Compared To  Previously owned 1996 Ranger STX  Checked out Chevy S10  Toyota Tacoma  Nissan Frontier Review Summary  My former Ranger was rock solid and the new Edge is just as good  I custom ordered the Edge model  4x2  4 0L engine  automatic  extended cab  power equip group  6CD changer  I have had constant coments on the looks and no one can tell that it it NOT a 4x4  The Edge package is a little sparse on interior extras  but that is by design  I have plenty of room for my gear inside bikes in the back  great power acceleration  and the automatic is a must for Seattle traffic  Gas mileage is pretty good as well  20mpg right out of the gate  I love this truck and would recommend to anyone  
Pos, I purchased this fully loaded 2000 Ford Ranger for my wife  The truck is the four door 4X4 off road model with every option available  The sticker price was  25 000  I purchased this truck to replace our 1997 Ford Ranger  Without a doubt the 4 door option is the greatest improvement  It makes the extended cab both useful and convenient  Ford also introduced a combination cassette cd stereo this year which has great sound  We couldn t believe that our 97 model was without cupholders  Ford corrected the problem in the 2000 model  The 2000 Ranger handles very well on the road  We have a cabin near Yellowstone and the Ranger manages the unplowed roads   10 14 inches with ease  It has tow hooks in front and back which make it easy for us to help friends without 4X4s when they take on more than their truck or car can handle I would not recommend that the off road package be purchased unless the buyer really had off road use  We love the flare sides on our sport model and really appreciated the automatic transmission and 4 wheel drive on the fly  All of the options are expensive  but it is a great looking sporty truck to drive br br  
Pos, We recently purchased the 2000 Ranger trail head  We haven t seen any on the street since we bought ours  I feel it isn t getting enough publicity The new Ranger Trailhead has a similar package to the 4 x4 big guys  with it s 16 quot  wheel base and high suspension  From the first look to the last you will mistake this new Trailhead for a 4x4 truck It however does not ride like any ordinary truck we ve driven before  It is quiet and comfortable  Get down to your Ford dealer right away and test drive this sporty and definately great looking Pick Up     
Pos, I bought my sport in July of 2002 and have not had any problems with it  I am really happy with the way it handles  I used to have a 93 explorer sport and the 93 handled like a dump truck compared to my 02   The steering is tight and there is minimal body lean  The power is very good  My 93 had pretty good power of the line but was a dog on the highway  My 02 is another story  My 02 has 204 hp versus 160 hp and you can really feel the difference on the highway and the off the line power is real good too  The seats are real firm but comfortable  My sport has the pioneer 290 watt 6 Disc changer with Subwoofer  Man this stereo sounds great  The interior looks great too with high quality  Mine has the overhead console too with compass and outside temperature with i find pretty useful although i did not think i would initially  The exterior styling is totally awesome   the best looking Suv out there  I get between 16 and 20 miles per gallon which i think is acceptable for a Suv  So i can say that i am really happy with my 02 sport  
Pos, We had a 1992 Ford Aerostar and really liked it  But when the transmission started to go we decided to shop for a  new to us  van We didn t know what we would end up with since we were shopping used  When we found the Windstar we ended up buying  we were pleased  We had to sacrifice on a couple of features we wanted but it had better safety ratings than the Dodge Caravan  which were everywhere on the used car lots We sacrificed on the dual sliding door when we were shopping we were close to having 4 children 6 and under and we wanted the ease of it  But reading safety reviews we realized that while giving up on convenience we were gaining in safety  As it turns out it wasn t a real sacrifice as the front drivers seat slides forward in such a way that a child can easily get into his seat and the driver slides the seat back into place easily  One thing we were not happy to give up was the heat air controls to the rear of the van  Thankfully we live in a very mild area with few temperature extremes so the boys don t get too hot or too cold Our gas mileage has been much better with this van than with the heavier Aerostar  I also like how it handles like a car We knew when purchasing this van that there is NO TRUNK space   it has a lot more than the Dodge Caravan however  It is difficult to fit a stroller in the back one of our double strollers is too big and won t fit  We had been spoiled by having the Aerostar extended so this has been an adjustment  I actually damaged the window tinting film by trying to cram a larger item into the too small trunk  If you have the choice by the extended version  The seats do pop out fairly easily  But while they can be done by only one person it is better suited to two people doing it We have had problems with the LOCKS  We have keyless remote entry  Sometimes either the sliding door or the trunk lock will not unlock that way  Thankfully we did discover that we can disarm the alarm and then use the key to unlock the stuck lock We also have a van that makes a very funny whiny noise  We ve grown used to it and it doesn t affect how it drives  but it is a bit annoying  We ve had our van described as a  rocket van  due to the noise I really like that carseat tether straps attach directly to a metal piece on the seat rather than the floor  It makes it much easier for the passengers in the rear bench seat to get into his seat  It is nice and roomy for our four boys and all the seats are quite comfortable  I would definitely buy a Windstar again and do recommend it highly after all  all vehicles have minor quirks  
Pos, We own a 1998 Windstar  We and everyone else who rides in it  is completely impressed by how well it handles and how smooth the ride is  I really love this car  We got the basic model with very few extras  Still  it is a great car for the money  I didn t realize what an awesome vehicle it was until we were in a car accident  Another vehicle pulled into the drivers side of our vehicle  We were going 30  he was probably going 15 20  We were thrown off the road  and I was 4 months pregnant  Very scary  However  the Windstar shut off when we were hit  so we avoided a huge pine tree in front of us  Also  from the looks of the inside of the vehicle  I though no damage had been done  I calmed myself down  then got out  and saw that the entire drivers side of the van looked like it had been bent in half  It was unbelievable  The drivers seat and all passenger seat areas on that side were not affected AT ALL  I was very impressed and relieved  Neither of us had any physical injuries or problems  At that point I was sold on driving a Windstar for the rest of my life  We have put 60 000   miles on our Windstar in 2 years  We travel an awful lot  We have had ONE malfunction with the vehicle  Our transmission went  That is the only complaint I have about this vehicle  I am not sure if it went because of how much we use it or not  We have a theory that it could be related to the accident we were in  As a side note  we were told that is a good idea to have the transmission serviced sooner than the owners manual suggests  I love the way the vehicle is laid out  I like the cup holders  the little compartments  and the handle to help you get in and out  Also  there are tether strap holders for car seats on every possible location standard in the Windstar  In addition  my husband s brother  a 6 3 quot  basketball player has accompanied us on road trips  and he prefers the back bench  So I guess it is fairly roomy back there  We plan on buying another Windstar  when we do buy again     
Pos, When we first married  my husband and I thought there wasn t any need for one of those staid  quot family quot  vehicles  the 90s equivalent of the station wagon  It didn t take long  two kids  to realize what the attraction is all about The Windstar first caught my eye by being the only US made minivan that had received a 5 star frontal crash rating from the U S  government  Interest piqued when the Insurance Institute showed us all how bad an off set crash can be  Now I had to drive one of these for myself The base Windstar GL is a no frills van  with the 3 0 L engine producing 150 hp  Not enough for someone trading in a Ford Mustang 5 0  so we decided that at the least we needed the optional 3 8 L V 6  which produces a more satisfying 200 hp  Vroom Vroom  The 3 8L engine also provides very sufficient power for highway merging and passing  and is fairly fast off the start line  ok  my nickname used to be  quot Mrs  Andretti quot  Match this with the 4 speed transmission  and we are ready to roll  Literally Since we knew that we would spend part of the ownership time in warmer climates  we sought a van with the rear air option  This can be operated by the controls on the dash  or the controls set into the pillar behind the driver  the B pillar in guy speak  Air flows into the cavernous rear area from a vent on the same pillar  and from four other vents  two above the middle seat  and two above the third seat  We have not had any problems with the A C  even living in muggy Hawaii  The van also cranks out some heat  enough to have to lower the settings after only a few minutes   Did I mention we used to live outside Seattle  hmm Minivans overall tout seating for seven  with Ford not being an exception  We have found that two adults can sit comfortably in the third seat with a child  but three adults in that seat are a tight fit  The seats themselves are very comfortable on long trips  but you pay for that feel when lugging them out  For smaller people  this could be a two person task  The third bench folds down onto itself  and rolls forward to touch the middle bench  opening up the rear cargo area even more  Ford had the correct intentions when installing tether strap anchors in the Windstar  putting two on the middle bench and one on the front passenger seat  That s correct  one under the front passenger seat  This puzzles me even more when I note that they neglected to put even one on the third row bench Most buyers in the market for a larger vehicle have come to expect that you pay for the safety and roominess at the gas pump  Again  Ford is right there in the pack with all the other auto makers  We average about 17 mpg in the city  and 23 highway  The 20 gallon tank keeps me from living at the local supply hut  gas station  but it does hurt when refueling  On newer models  Ford now offers a 26 gallon tank  but that could just be delaying the inevitable Our van of choice was a great find at a Washington dealer  For  16 000  we ended up with exactly what we were looking for  We have many options available with the LX such as the roof rack  aforementioned rear air  privacy glass   quot Premium Sound quot  system  more speakers basically  power locks and windows  and headrests for every seating position except the third bench  middle seat  The power rear quarter windows are great for airing the van out  and the power side view mirrors make an easy task of adjusting for individual driver tastes  The only option lacking from the step up is the power driver seat  which may be more hassle than it is worth  The 1998 Windstar has a good list of standard options  ABS brakes  dual front airbags  nicer cloth seats than some other auto makers  Plymouth comes to mind  power steering and brakes  height  adjustable seatbelts for front passengers  tilt wheel and cruise control  which has controls set into the steering wheel itself  With the 1998 model only  Ford delayed jumping on the driver side sliding door addition in a very interesting way  The driver door is longer than other model years  and the driver seat is positioned on rails  The seat will slide up against the steering wheel  allowing easy access through the doorway  When I first saw this option  I wondered what idiot thought of this  I didn t see a need for entry on that side  not with a 5 ft  entryway on the other  Ahh  motherhood  As the mother of two small kids  my husband and I can position ourselves on each side of the van to load kids  The space left open behind this seat is large by any means  I can stand hunched over  adjusting my daughter s car seat  and I am 6 ft  tall  While I envy the driver side door  since it would be a much easier option  I know I would lose the convenient cupholder  recessed bin  and rear A C control access that my 4 year old has right there  The drive  The van can t corner on rails  and I wouldn t recommend trying it  but it does have a comfortable ride  Small bumps in the road are hidden  the steering wheel has a solid feel to it  and very little road noise intrudes into the cabin area  At highway speeds  some tire noise is heard  but it is not very loud  We recently had to have the transmission rebuilt  under warranty  thank you Ford  and it was a little soon in the life of any vehicle  at 35 000 miles  Oh those pesky AXOD transmissions  Ford is reputed to have known of problems with certain transmissions linked to certain engine sizes  but luckily we were able to have ours fixed under warranty  Because of the infamous 3 8L engine  head gasket problems and transmission problems  I can t give my van 5 stars  as much as it pains me to admit After over a year of ownership  we don t know what we would do without this wonderful invention called the minivan  I do have to note that it has been to the shop twice this year  the  quot check engine quot  light came on  requiring a trip to the dealer for an evaporator and an oxygen sensor replacement  It was during this visit that the dealership noted for us the transmission hesitation  and scheduled us for a second visit  The service department at the local Ford dealer was very helpful  as dealerships go  When it was determined that necessary parts had to be ordered from the mainland  the dealership paid for a 3 week car rental  my choice  Ford Explorer  heehee  All of this was covered under warranty  so our only out of pocket costs so far have been for oil changes  Anyone in the market for a used minivan  looking for the safest  used  van available  Well  you just found it     
Pos, I purchased my new Windstar on January 9  1998 and have driven it some 36 350 miles  I keep complete computer records on mileage  maintenance  and repairs and would like to report that I have averaged 23 07 mpg during this time with a low mileage of 17 65 and high mileage of 27 25 mpg while always using regular unleaded fuel in this V 6 3 8L engine  About one third of my driving is on interstates and the balance is short trips  I view the Windstar as reliable  but the following items had to be addressed  to wit  1  replaced both headlight assemblies due to moisture invasion  2  replaced the transmission field sensor  3  repaired the transmission due to a faulty mid range part  4  replaced a cruise control assembly  5 replaced a defective driver side door window activator  and 6  re calibrate the computer  This sounds like a lot of work  but all was replace under warranty by my excellent Ford dealer and the vehicle is performing well I really like the excellent ride probably due in part to the larger 121 inch wheelbase  The van is relatively quite and is most responsive during acceleration and de acceleration     
Pos, We 146ve had our 98 Windstar since it was new and give it an overall excellent to superb rating  PROS  The Windstar is a decent sized minivan  There is enough cargo space behind the back seat to load a couple hundred dollars worth of groceries  Other minivans I looked at such as the Dodge Plymouth Caravan  Japanese models  and the Chevy Astro were lacking in this area The Windstar is a nice riding vehicle with great driveability  The seats are very comfortable for long trips and the dash is laid out perfectly  This van is probably heavier than it 146s counterparts  which will affect gas mileage and performance  but it 146s worth it for it 146s 5 star safety rating  This vehicle feels very  very solid Weather sealing is superb  Road noise is not bad at all  The brakes have performed flawlessly and still do not require replacement at the 60K mile mark The engine and transmission have performed flawlessly and are very smooth though shifts can be mushy at times  You 146re better off turning off the over drive in town or the transmission may  147hunt 148 for the right gear  I like how Ford put the over drive button on the gearshift making this very simple and easy CONS  The door ajar sensing switches are prone to failure causing the light and audible alarm to continue to annoy you until you exceed 15 MPH  This is very frustrating  It will usually quit within the first mile or two but Ford needs to find a permanent fix for this problem  This same problem existed in the Aerostar  You 146d think they could find a better system  UPDATE  I found that if you spray WD 40 or a similar light oil in the door latch this problem may go away  Dirt seems to be the culprit since the door ajar switches part of the door latch  This area obviously isn t sealed The driver side and passenger side front doors are too large  This is great when you need them but when you park on an upward incline they tend to slam shut at the most inopportune times  I E  on your legs or back when leaning in the vehicle  Even worse your kids  This is the only safety factor with this vehicle  For some reason each of the four Ford cars and vans I have owned have had problems with excessive battery corrosion  The batteries usually last two years at the most  My GMC pick up has seven years on a four year battery and is still starting fine RECOMMENDATIONS  If you want a 98 Windstar look for the following options and or problems 1  Get rear air conditioning even if you live in a cool climate  It 146ll add to the resale value and the additional air ducting will help with heating for the rear passengers in the winter 2  Opt for the large engine  The 3 0 is what I have and it 146s very peppy but the 3 8 would provide nearly the same gas mileage with an increase of torque and horsepower  3  Check the front suspension for loose or damaged components  I had a bolt loosen itself on the front stabilizing bar in the passenger side wheel well  It made rattling noises whenever a bump was hit  I torqued it down and have had no problems since 4  Test drive the vehicle to see if it has the faulty door ajar sensors Other than the things mentioned this vehicle has been very reliable and a pleasure to drive  Other brands of minivans also have their quirks and problems too which you 146ll find if you look at reviews for those  I feel the Windstar is a very safe and reliable vehicle for the entire family and a good value UPDATE  As of March 2003 the Windstar is still a reliable vehicle  Some problems noted since writing my initial review are   Drivers side window quit working and sliding door lock quit working  These items should not have failed with 70 000 miles on the vehicle  Resale value has also dropped faster than I anticipated  I would still recommend this vehicle though even with these flaws  
Pos, I don t even own a minivan  but I wish I did  I have a two year old and a three month old  and drive a small car  That is one tough thing to do  My father recently purchased a Windstar  and I fell in love with it I love the fact that there are climate controls in the front and back  the doors can be locked from the tailgate  the seats adjust nicely  and the windows can be rolled up after the ignition is turned off I think my favorite feature about this minivan is that the driver s seat can be moved forward to get to the back seat without having to go around to the other side  I have borrowed my dad s Windstar many times  and this really comes in handy The safety ratings on this vehicle have highly impressed me  and the ease of use has me sold  When I do buy another vehicle  it will be the Windstar  It drives great  and rides even better br br  
Pos, After being in a horrible accident with the 5 of us in the van  I decided to look  quot only quot  for a mini van with the highest crash test ratings for safety  That is the only way for my family  Ford Windstar rated the best among all the mini vans on the market today  I love my Windstar  Its nice looking and very safe for my family  It has the ABS brakes  front and passenger side airbag  And the drop down motor in the case of a front crash to keep the motor from coming in on the driver and front passenger  Keyless entry  and for those of us with our hands full and unable to use the key to unlock the doors this is a great feature that I definately wanted and needed and its a wonderful thing to have  The seats and everything are nice inside and looks and feels great The price is right too for this nice mini van  And the style is a wonderful atribution to the Ford Family br br  
Pos, We were expecting our fourth child and knew that riding in two cars was just not economical or expectable  I always have wanted a mini van and to be honest never considered a Ford till shopping around  YES the sales people did make a difference  but what really did it for us was that we could get WHAT we wanted  for the price we wanted without upgrading it and getting every little add on  We chose the one we did because of the room  the simplicity  little computer components  which to us means lower repair bills  What really surprised us is the mileage  We have driven it to Florida twice now and it beat our Honda Accord hands down and was so much more comfortable  The turning ratio is not as good as some we drove  but the roominess and the comfort is fantastic and a better trade  I am overweight and everything fits me  which is another bonus We will always by one  just keep trading it up for a new one  I test drove them all and will never turn from the Windstar again br br  
Pos, I was very skeptical about buying a mini van  Once I test drove the Ford Windstar 1998 model  I knew it was the mini van for me  I bought the Windstar because of the price and because of the five star safety test  I have three kids so I need lots of room for soccer balls  book bags and other things boys collect  I would have to say that Windstar has tons of room on the inside  The back seat folds down fairly easily and there is tons of space behind the back seat to store a stroller and groceries  I haven t had any problems with my Windstar so far but I highly recommend it     
Pos, Right now I am a year and a half into my second Windstar and couldn t be happier with it  I leased a  95 Windstar and returned it after the lease was up  I would have loved to have purchased it but financially it just wouldn t work Because of the good luck I had with the  95 when I was in the market in  98 I bought another Windstar  Even with all the hype surrounding the redesigned Dodge I felt the Windstar was still the only minivan that didn t drive like a truck  The Windstar felt and handled like a larger car  The only thing I didn t really like is the front end design  The grille work and lights make the van look  quot unhappy quot  Look at it and you ll see With the facelift the  00 received and the addition of another sliding door the Windstar has just gotten better Recommendations  Definitely get the V6  you will need the power Two minor annoyances  The cupholders for the front are not too sturdy  One of mine broke already  The sensors for the sliding door are very sensitive  They give false readings that the door is not closed all the way br br  
Pos,  BULLETIN  Our Explorer was nudging 30 000 miles during a difficult month for us   a major service was needed but I was paralyzed with indecision about how the nearest FORD Dealer in Carson City NV would react  My preliminary inquiries about the car and possible warranty issues  Were simply brushed off with condescending comments   no offers to FIX things b  We were filled with misgivings for months  I did not trust them  Our laundry list had grown a bit  The front passenger seat belt was hanging up now  That was preceded by troubles with the Hazard Lights switch  the rear window wiper would not work  and a couple of minor irritants  Came the day of decision   I took the Car over the hill  Sierras  to Sacramento  CA where we had purchased our prize  The service consulant appeared  wrote up the 30 000 mile service  379  I added a  112  including labor  set of mud flaps  then he lent a very interested ear to my woes  He looked at all four items  wrote them down  I asked him to estimate the costs to me   I was willing to come all the way back  224 mile round trip  to accommodate their schedule  He blinked  then took the keys   And offered me a free rental car b  The best place to be while enduring dentistry and car repairs is elsewhere and I went there for several hours  I returned after several hours to find the  Explorer  still sitting in its stall  Of course  it was a  big  service and I had added the mud flaps at the last second  After another hour  came the call    542 24  OK   379 plus 112    491 plus Sales Tax    50 Deductible on Warranty  Seemed OK  What about the repairs estimate    Huh  Those items were fixed   on Warranty b  I fainted  It is incredible how much difference a Dealer can make   With the recent models of their  EXPLORER  SUV the Ford Motor Company appears to have beaten the Import Market at its own game  In fact  Ford  HAS BECOME  an import company  having absorbed such as Jaguar and Volvo recently  These acquisitions came with new  foreign  expertise  combined with the best of a century of manufacturing and merchandising in the USA  With these assets  Ford is producing new products that deliver what the buyer has become used to getting during the past 25 years  What did Ford do  Study the competition and note what the buyers like and try to do it better  Rather than torment buyers with agonizing decisions about options that should be standard items  Ford has created and delivers a standardized vehicle in three basic versions  any one of which can overcome buyer resistance with an ample complement of attractive and useful features that make sense and are easy to use  It should not be necessary to mention but high quality workmanship should be evident everywhere in the vehicle  It is   WHAT MADE US CONSIDER THIS VEHICLE b  From 1973 to 1999  we owned imports by BMW  Audi  VW and Toyota  in that order  They offered reasonable pricing  fuel economy  needed few options and were readily recognizable  They delivered performance and  at times  lots of satisfaction but a graph would show how we fared monetarily   outrageously costly maintenance says it all  Our son  cured of his addiction to Toyotas  purchased a Camry replacement last year   One of his best friends is an executive with FORD  It was a Ford EXPLORER  With TWO Wheel Drive And so  we were ready to be  converted  back  or domesticated   THE PURCHASE b  After two years of planning  we ventured into the car market  For budgeting reasons  the used car market was suitable for us and the search began  My wife wrote the specifications  Explicitly  what she wanted had to be WHITE  have FOUR doors  less than FIVE years old  have LOW mileage  a reasonable PRICE  and COMFORTable  My input was limited to avoiding 4 Wheel Drive Fully prepared  we went off on a joyride one Friday and found our dream car  No luck on color  otherwise they had a 1998 that met her criteria  Exceeded it  in fact  The mileage was only 16 400  Marilyn  currently the breadwinner of the family  did the road testing  It was a  GO  The light green car sold itself   OPERATING  The first impression when entering the EXPLORER is of the ample head room provided in the opening  as well as the roof ceiling height  No more contusions on my poor pate  Although the EXPLORER is a relatively complex vehicle  it is easy to drive  The engine power is ample  easily overcoming challenges from changes in terrain  Although the center of gravity is higher  the EXPLORER glides around curves   Being a car on a truck chassis  the ride becomes  jouncy  when passing over bumps and depressions in the pavement at slow speeds  This is a negligible nuisance i  The transmission gear changes are barely perceptible  The transitions to and from OVERDRIVE are detectable only on the Tachometer  The overdrive control is within reach of an extended finger on the gear selection stalk  Acceleration is startlingly effective  The SOHC V6 needs only the lightest touch on the pedal to take the EXPLORER from standing start to road speed  I estimate that adequate performance in traffic requires only about 1 4  of pedal  Why all that power  For towing a ton and a half trailer with full passenger complement   The EXPLORER is also available with a V8 engine  the operation of which must be pretty exciting i  The instruments and controls are clustered to allow the operator to run the machine without undue distraction from the road and traffic  Crucial instruments are larger  crucial controls  including windshield visibility  are within reach of an extended finger  One must reach for others  an effort that usually involves taking one s eyes off the road  Driver information from the instrument set is abundant  although some warning lights are so small that anxiety can replace knowledge  As in an aircraft cockpit  an operator should know the instrument layout so well that a  sweeping  scan is all that is needed to ascertain that operations are normal  Close scrutiny is advisable only when the vehicle is stopped  The same goes for the Steering Wheel  tilt  adjustment  Simply stated  DO NOT try to do this while the vehicle is in motion  Handling is rewarding and crisp  the EXPLORER has a very tight turning ratio  making it one of the most nimble vehicles we have driven  At road speeds  the steering is VERY sensitive  requiring very little input from the operator  This advantage has a price  One should maintain high levels of attention to the task at hand  Both hands  that is  Braking is steady and smooth  We have not tested the panic conditions for which the ABS system was designed  The parking brake WORKS  an easy push of the foot will set it  The controls for the  Cruise  control  labeled  Speed  for some reason  are located on the steering wheel  One should get to know the 5 buttons by touch  studying them on the road is foolishness  The system is very accurate  requiring only a touch to set and to disable   CAUTIONARY ADVISORY  Since it is a relatively high performance design  the EXPLORER is demanding on drivers  who must learn to concentrate on the task of running this finely tuned machine  All too often  drivers seem to become intoxicated with the SUV concept and design and allow the vehicle to govern them  An operator who is distracted by passengers  usecured items items in the seating areas  comfort and audio control settings and  of course  the infamous cell phones  is out of control and is a hazard to persons and property  A lack of attention can lead to an unpleasant emergency situation  Of course  the aggressive driver is a threat to all  A high performance vehicle like the EXPLORER is unforgiving of driver errors  which can account for some of the highly publicized rollovers   Tire air pressure is problematic  the recent spate of highly publicized accidents illustrate that  In the Ford EXPLORER operator s manual  the recommendation is to inflate per instructions molded onto the tire itself  35PSI on our present equipment  On the EXPLORER itself  a door sticker advises a conflicting pressure of only 26 PSI  This utterly silly and dangerous advice probably stemmed from some anxious sales executive who meant to  soften  the ride for some target buyer segment that dislike  hard  or bumpy rides   or trucks in general  The Explorer design came from the  Ranger  pickup chassis  Anyone with experience with radial tires going flat will recollect how sloppy the handling becomes  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE TIRE YOU ARE INFLATING i   DISAPPOINTMENTS  We had some at first  exacerbated by an indifferent dealer in Nevada   15 miles North of here  Per the above  all disappointments were remedied by a crackerjack dealer   112 miles West of here   SATISFACTION  It is a complete success with us  We have had it for eight months now and expect to keep it for 6 5 years  So far  each day has brought a new and happy surprise for us   Ours is a 1998 2WD  two wheel drive    NOT a 2D  two door  Model  SPORT  which is otherwise similar but shorter   FEATURES  This is a high end model variation  commonly referred to as  Loaded  which package includes

Pos, I love my 1995 Ford Explorer with automatic transmission and four wheel drive For one thing  the ride is smoother than the ride of the average truck  And I love the increased height of the vehicle   My Honda Civic is a great little car but I feel like I m dragging my butt on the ground in comparison In  quot Christopher quot   yes  I name my cars  the great explorer and protector  I can survey the road from a dominant position  Other drivers stay out of my way I m Canyon Woman   Queen of the Wild Frontier When it rains hard  we have many flood sites here in San Antonio  But I need not worry  If that sedan in front of me can make it through the water  I ve got it made  I m Canyon Woman   Queen of the Wild Frontier When I go shopping for small furniture  I need not hire a mover  I m tough and able to carry my own purchase  I m well  you know In case of deep snow  well  it COULD happen even here in South Texas  I m ready  Rough terrain is my Christopher s forte  I love my power seat package and plan to buy the equivalent in any future vehicle  The ability to fine tune the seat position makes a significant difference in driver and passenger comfort Air conditioner heater controls for back seat passengers greatly increase their comfort The V6 engine is the perfect blend of power  yet economy  The extra wide cargo space is home to furry pups as well as bricks and garden supplies you name it My only error in choosing this vehicle was in the color  The  quot Mocha Frost quot   okay TAN  exterior looks exactly like 40  of the other Explorers on the road  I often approach a look alike in the parking lot  wondering why my  quot clicker quot  isn t working to unlock the door  Also  the tan interior shows dirt far worse than my previous vehicle with a gray interior The left turn signal seems a little glitchy  often turning itself off before I get to the turn  My friend s Explorer does the same thing I had warranty work done to fix a problem with the column shift when Christopher was new  The service was problem free After five years my only service expenses have been for routine maintenance I love to take my Explorer out on the road after a good wash and wax with tires gleaming and the radio blasting  okay  so I listen to talk radio and my hearing s not as good as it used to be I m Canyon Woman Queen of the Wild Frontier br br  
Pos, I wanted something that could haul anything  anywhere  and at anytime  At the same time  I wanted it to have a comfortable ride  and good handling  My Ford Explorer Limited has done all of this and more  I ve only had to do regular maintenance services  If I were to knock it  I wish it stood taller on the road  Mine is a 1995 and has performed better than I expected  I do wish utility vehicles got a little better gas mileage  The seats are comfortable on long trips  I m not beat up nor fatigued when I get to my destination  It s a nice compromise between a regular road car  van  amp  pick up truck  I d highly recommend one to any one looking for versatility  If you want a vehicle that will do many things besides get you there  you should definitely consider a utility vehicle  You won t be disappointed     
Pos, I have found that used Explorers are a good investment most of the time  It seems that previous owners take pride in maintaining these vehicles in top condition  I own a 1995 Explorer  Eddie Bauer Edition  This vehicle still looks new and drives just like new  It handles well and gives a firm ride  which is what a sport utility vehicle is supposed to do  If you are looking for a soft luxury ride  don t buy a SUV  buy a luxury car  But  if you are looking for a good handling  firm ride and towing abilities  then consider a new or used Ford Explorer in the 4 door body style  not the 2 door Sport  it is short and the ride is not as good  The only problem I have encountered in 86 000  miles is when towing the gas mileage drops dramatically  I have the V 6  should have had a V 8 br br  
Pos, My husband Jeff is a contractor that travels all over the country  Up until December of 1999 he did this in a very large  very old  very unsafe Ford passenger van  I knew he had been looking around for a used vehicle to pull his 20 foot cargo trailer around the country with  then one day I got a call from him  He was in Chicago and he had just test drove a brand spanking new 2000 F350 dually  He immediately fell in love with it  It was a long bed 4x4 with a powerstroke diesel  The dealership even let him hook up his trailer for the test drive  After much haggling  he finally got the price down from  42 000 to  36 000  He then filled out the credit application and headed home then told me about his little adventure  but that s another story  He got the call a couple of days later to come pick up his shiny new truck  so he back off to Chicago Of course  from the beginning  I held a grudge and hated everything about this truck  I was a  530 payment we didn t really need  it was brand new  and with the amount of miles he drives  I just knew it was a bad investment to buy a new vehicle  And it was big  Extremely big  But Jeff convinced me that it was much safer for him than the old van  and that the diesel engine would last a very long time  Slowly but surely this truck that I had deemed so evil started to grow on me  Of course it was hard to get used to driving this monster vehicle after driving my 1997 Ford Taurus for the past year and a half  but I soon mastered it  Soon  I grew to love this truck more than my trusty taurus  The Powerstroke Diesel is much quieter than the Cummins that Dodge and Chevy use  and it has more power  so when you re pulling a 20 foot trailer loaded down with shingles  carpet and linoleum the truck doesn t lurch  It also doesn t use any more fuel than it normally would without the trailer  The Powerstroke is reliable  and the transmission behind it very strong  Being in the construction business  my husband knows many guys with different trucks  and many of these guys have had their trucks in the shop several times getting work done on their Alison trannies  Any down time on your truck in this business is a week without a paycheck  so we appreciate the dependability of the Ford  But there are times  although few and far between  that my husband isn t on the road and we use the truck to haul friends and family instead of a trailer  The width and length of the crew cab makes the interior enormous  We have had 6 adults in the truck and there was still plenty of room to stretch out  The crew cab was made for just that  a crew  The folks at Ford did a wonderful job of designing the interior of the cab  In addition to being roomy  it offers plenty of adjustable cup holders  front and back seats  extra power outlets  and storage  Any road noise and diesel noise is deadened inside the truck  The seats are very comfortable and the design is ergonomic  which is extremely important when you drive up to 16 hours a day to get across the country  When Jeff bought the truck  it had 52 miles on it  Now  a year later  it has over 65 000  and over 50 000 of those miles have been pulling a trailer  We have not had any hint of trouble so far  and have never done anything but regular maintenance and tire changes on it  Of course  regular maintenance is a bit more expensive than on my little Taurus  which only takes 5 qts of oil  but the longevity of the diesel will be worth it  This truck is very practical for anyone that has many people to haul around  for people that pull trailers or RV s  or just desires a strong truck to do everyday chores such as pulling large stumps  helping stranded motorists  or hauling heavy loads  The only thing I don t like about the truck is the fact that for in town use  going to the grocery store and such  the sheer size of it makes parking very difficult  and it may catch a few curbs in town while going around corners  Make sure you re ready for that before you purchase it  But all around  this is a well thought out  powerful truck that still rides smooth and will last a very  very long time     
Pos, At the time of this writing  I have had my SVT Focus for about two weeks  and I am in love Let s start with the visuals  Personally  I have a very slight issue with the way the window line travels up to the rear of the car on the sides  and then back down to a point on the gate  I don t think it looks  bad   per se  but I can t tell you exactly what the issue I have actually  is   I can only say there s  something  about it  So  I ordered mine in black not only because I love black cars  but also to de emphasize the rear window line  I even blacked out the windows with dark tint  I think it looks completely sharp in black  and let me tell you   if Darth Vader drove a car  this would be it I love Ford s New Edge design concept  which traces it s roots back directly to the Ford GT 90 concept car of the early nineties  who says concept cars serve no purpose in the production world  and I think they did a particularly bang up job with the Focus 3 door  much better than the new style Cougar  The car looks like it s hauling a  even when it s parked  I often find myself standing and staring at it after parking just because it looks so darned cool  The agressive  angular front end mates well with the curved  swooping roofline that tapers off in the rear  and the custom fog lights  rear spoiler  and 17 inch argent five star rims that SVT installed put the icing on the cake  Not that cheap sugar icing  either   we re talking gourmet butter icing  baby And  although it is defined as a  small car  it really isn t that small  It s taller than most of the cars I park next to  and the wheelbase is 103 inches Let s talk about comfort now The smell of the leather interior is absolutely dreamy  and it is outdone only by the way the SVT seat wraps around you and makes you feel completely comfy while driving  They fit  me  so well  in fact  that when I m driving  I actually cannot feel the seat  Say what  You read that right  Let me explain  You know how  after you ve been in a car for a while  you can tell what parts of the seat are pushing on you  Maybe your thighs are pressing against the side supports  or the lumbar support is jutting into your back a tad too much  or maybe even that darned seatbelt extension is about an inch too long  and it s poking your beer belly  No problems for me in the SVT  Even after extended periods in the car  the seat feels completely natural  This is due  in part  to the nice adjustments Ford built into them  Not only can you adjust the lumbar support  back angle  and forward position  but you can also adjust the ride height of the seat  Very nice for adjusting the headroom and seeing over the steering wheel  should you need a  boost  BTW  I m 6 1  200 lbs  just so you can gauge Driving position is excellent and sporty  The steering wheel and gear shifter are  exactly  where they should be in relation to the driver  All controls are within easy reach  and the leather wrapped wheel and shift knob are a dream to grab  The silver faced guage cluster is awesome and easy to see  At night  the faces glow green and the numbers are black  The red SVT graphic on the panel glows purple under the gauge lights   pretty cool I think the stereo controls could have been laid out a little more stylishly  but they aren t bad  They re definitely better than the plastic toy Speak  n Spell style buttons that GM loves to put in their vehicles  The stereo display is large and very easy to read  Oh  by the way  it sounds great  too  The subwoofer is very powerful  especially for an eight incher  It is concealed in a nicely finished ported box that sits on the driver side wall in the cargo area  This takes up a little bit of your cargo room  of course  but hey   did I buy an SVT to haul groceries and gear in huge quantities  No  I can deal with it  The six disc in dash CD changer is a luxury   no annoying cartridge to deal with  you just load them all in the slot  There is also a radio stereo control stalk that comes off the steering column on the lower left side for easy finger tip sound control while driving In summation  when you close the door and seal yourself inside  the relationship of driver and car is T I G H T Road noise is a bit of an issue  due in large part  in my opinion  to the low profile ContiSport tires and large 17  rims  That s a lot more solid material to transfer sound  and you can tell  It s not bothersome to me  but if it irks someone like you  then the application of some aftermarket spray undercoating would take care of a lot of the noise Yes  the ride is rough on less than desireable roads  but I wouldn t have it any other way  You pay a price for a car that performs and handles as well as the SVT Focus Handling is a dream  pure and simple  I didn t think it was possible  but the SVT handles as well and is as fun to drive as my hopped up Alfa Romeo GTV6  and that is saying a  lot   If you have ever driven an Alfa  you know what fun they are  and the SVT matches  The car goes exactly where you point it  and there is no perceivable torque steer  which is something that has always irked me about front drivers  How tight is it  Last night I took a corner that was marked for 30 MPH at 65  I don t recommend you try this at home  Coming into the unexpected turn  I thought I was going to dig a trench  but instead  the SVT dipped its nose  dug in  and sprung right back out again  taking the turn and teaching the road a lesson while it was at it  Amazing  It behaved like it had a tough racing torsion bar suspension  In  dip  and out For a front driver especially   61 39  weight distribution b  the handling is amazingly neutral  There is no pronounced over  or understeer  unless you really  want  it to be there  Once again  the driver is in command The engine is amazing  Ford took the already nice Zetec I 4 found in the ZX3 and cooked up a variable intake valve timing system  which ups the HP from 130 to 170  and gives you 145 lb ft of torque to work with  Couple this power with the  gorgeous  Getrag six speed gear box  and you have speed on demand through the entire range of the engine  Seriously  There are no dead spots in the power curve  From stop to redline  the motor will pull and go like a champ  with no perceivable lag anywhere  and it sounds great doing it The gear ratios are right on target  too  Normally  with a modern manual transmission  esp  a six speed  I expect fifth or sixth gear to be sort of an  overdrive  gear  not worth much for performance  However  sixth gear in the SVT is actually a useable gear  All of them are very nicely and smoothly spaced In addition to the VIVT system  Ford also stuck in some other improvements  including forged steel connecting rods  aluminum pistons  and a dual stage intake system  which dramatically improves torque and low end performance  The compression ratio is also higher  at 10 2 1  so you have to use premium fuel There are also some pretty cool mods after the engine  including the dual mass flywheel and one in two out shaft design of the gearbox  If you want to know how these work  you can find the info at http www svt ford com You have to be careful when shopping for an SVT Focus  because many dealers will charge an extra fee on top of the MSRP simply because it s an SVT  and therefore more collectible  However  if you shop around  you can find dealers that won t gouge you  I found mine at Covert Ford  in Austin  for sticker   19 265 00  which is exactly what Ford says they should charge  Northside Ford  in San Antonio  wanted 23K for the same car In case you didn t know  not all Ford dealers sell SVT cars  Only specially authorized dealers get them  and they are only allotted a certain number per year  If you find one for MSRP  don t expect to talk them down on the price  either  SVTs are also usually exempt from any special deals or rebates  Having the SVT badge on your car guarantees a certain level of collectibility  and the dealers know it Being an SVT owner has other perks as well  You get a free one year membership to the SVT Owners Assoc  and a free loaner car when yours is in for servicing  Nice touch If you re into it  there are also TONS of aftermarket performance parts available for the Focus  Not that it needs it  
Pos, When I started  looking  for a new auto I became  focused   no pun intended  on the specification and configuration requirements that were important to me  Now  to tell the truth  I may be a little biased as I generally like Fords and would only consider Subaru as a Japanese auto but  nevertheless  I still made it my mission to be informed about all autos that met my criteria  Out of the  models  that I narrowed it down to   the Subaru Forrester  03  only came with an  unremarkable  power source  the Subaru Impreza WRX kind of suited me but I was a little concerned about the interior room  this was a close one   I still love this car  The upcoming Subaru Baja would not be out for a while and still only had a mediocre engine  Actually  I hadn t even considered a Focus  Why  I wanted to get away from front wheel drive vehicles  I had a  front driver  at the time  my first  and was a little put off by the  quirkiness  of its  handling characteristics  I was about ready to just wait until something came along that suited me   and then something made me decide to give the Focus a try  I drove a  normal  2002 ZX3 and I loved it enough to consider buying it   but before I did I at least made the attempt to locate an SVT model  To make a long story short   I bought one  The handling is great  The looks are cool  subjective  The interior room and features are incredulous  You may find it hard to believe but it does handle better than the WRX  though not as fast  This is what front wheel drive should feel like  Only problem  mine came with a defect   the radiator had a hole or puncture  warranty item  There is no perfect car for everyone  rhetorical  but if I could be  greedy  then I d like to see 4 doors ZX 5  more power and all wheel drive  like the WRX This car is astounding for the price but many may not consider it because they may  group  it as a small car associated with the younger genre  
Pos, In dire need for a car to take to school with me in the fall  I was looking for something dependable since it s a 600 mile round trip  as well as affordable since  well  I don t have much money First  I test drove a Dodge Stratus  and thanks to  Epinions   I was able to see it would be nothing but a hassle and a money pit So  I re scoured the Classified section of my newspaper and saw that there was a   96 Ford Taurus GL  for  7995 available   quot Loaded quot  the ad read  so I called the guy and went to look at it  Surprised that the car only had 65K miles on it  I was thinking that this blue green beauty just might be a vehicular reality for me  I took it for a test drive  and this 3 0L V6 practically drove itself out of the parking lot  It just wanted to go  I was very pleased with the way it handled turns  acceleration  reversals  and noticed no palpable thumps or rattles which would indicate problem spots  The dealer made sure to mention that the rotors may have to be turned or replaced  and that I might feel a slight vibration when I break quite the courteous remark  no In seeing that I know nearly nothing about cars  in a technical sense  I sent my older brother to look at it  In beautiful shape  he agreed that it seemed to be an excellent deal  so I purchased it at  7 495 since I paid in cash This car handles like a  Grand Am  around tight turns even when the speedometer is pushing 40  Acceleration is no problem for this car as I have made it to 100 with ease  i I was just testing it i  The sound system is by Ford  but they do an excellent job  So far it is a clear  seamless system which features a detachable radio antennae so that when I go through a car wash  I won t lose my FM  Also  there are 2  extra  speakers in alignment with the side view mirrors  which further beautifies the sound  as it envelopes you even more   However   if you are looking to put in a new  stronger system with a CD player  mine just has AM FM cassette  you may not be able to because of the way the  Taurus b  radio face is set up  It is too big and basically encompasses the AC and heat control as well  so I am not aware whether or not a new system can be put in very easily  I have a feeling that you sacrifice performance for looks and convenience b LowDown  Overall  however  I love this car  An excellent ride  I feel extremely safe in all respects  The trunk is  deep   an especially important consideration for a college student such as myself  It is a very roomy car  and as a rather big person at 6 2 quot  210lbs  I have had no problem fitting comfortably  The power everything features of this car make it quite a pleasure to drive  and as for dependability  I consistently hear stories of historically pleased  Taurus  owners who praise its longevity  Try one today br br  
Pos, History  I purchased this automobile at 6K and have driven it on paved to gravel roads  Most of the miles on this car have been highway  I have replaced two unrelated engine sensors in the 60K I have driven it  These two sensors were backed up in the programming and did not disable the car before I took it to the shop  Look and Feel  This automobile is more stylish than the GM equivalents that I was comparing it to at the time  update your car interiors GM  and I have not been too impressed with my previous ownership encounters of Dodge and Chrysler products  Has a smooth ride and handles good for a larger car  It is very comfortable and it didn t feel like I was riding on the ground like some of the Honda  Subaru  or sporty autos  Economy  The car averages 23 25 MPG on the highway  but does prefer the higher octane 89 and can ping under load on hills when driving slow back roads using 87 octane  Body Integrity  Body is still in great shape and the paint still has a good finish  Wiper arms were frozen one winter and were a problem  The wiper bolt will not keep arm fixed on the shaft  This part has aluminum splines and sheered off never to work properly again without modification or replacement  Final Comments  It has made for some comfortable 10 hour trips for four people numerous times  However the weight of the full trunk of luggage and the two people  small people in the back seat is a bit too much for the rear suspension  On some sharp quick inclines the car bottoms out on the springs and is that is not very comforting Recommendation  I will buy this auto in the future when I need another 4 door sedan br br  
Pos, We purchased a use 1996 Taurus LX earlier this year  Now  I like the car  Don t get me wrong  I just feel like a little old lady every time I get into it  It reminds me of my grandmother  who has always driven a Ford  Since my husband is 4 years older than me I ll give him a break  The Taurus LX is the most luxurious car I ve ever driven  but then I ve only driven fun cars like Trackers and Eclipses  This vehicle is power everything  It s an automatic  I m still young enough to love a stick shift  The seats are the epitome of comfort who wants to fall asleep when their driving  It handles beautifully  there is a bare minimum of bumps in the road give me my tracker any day  I love bouncing down the road  It is very spacious  lot s of room for groceries or bodies depending on your hobbies  Overall it s very comfortable  In about 5 years when my husband goes through his midlife crisis and buys that red convertible sports car  I guess I will be ready to settle down into a nice old lady car  It s nice to know it will be here waiting for me  I just hope it doesn t come to soon br br  
Pos, After my daughter was born  I just knew that I would have to give up my need for speed  Sports cars and kids just don t mix  I began my journey for an affordable family car with a little sport  and never dreamed I would find it in the Taurus  My husband actually convinced me to test drive it  and I loved it  The back seat is wonderful for car seats  It is easy to put them in  and easy to remove them  There is child locks on the doors  and locks for the windows  The front middle seat pushes down for easy access to the kids  or folds up to reveal a neat little cubby hole for drinks  and any other junk you want to hide  The best part is that I can still get up and go  I love knowing that I can still beat those slow pokes at the red lights  and be safe in my Taurus br br  
Pos, Ford has done an overall excellent job designing and building their new Super Duty line of trucks  with only a few exceptions  I own a 1999 F250 Super Duty crew cab short bed 4x4 with the Powerstroke diesel engine and an automatic transmission that I ordered from the factory and took delivery of in May of 1999  I also recently helped relatives order their new 2000 F250 Super Duty super cab  short bed 4x2 with the Triton V8 engine and automatic transmission  The Excellent stuff The new Ford Super Duty trucks are the largest  tuffest  roomiest  nicest riding  and have the highest available tow ratings of any full size trucks in their class  The crew cab is particularly spacious in the front and rear seats  I am 6 2 quot  tall and 225 lbs  and I and 5 others of my size could quite comfortably ride for many hours in my truck  all the while towing a very large boat or travel trailer  I call my truck the   quot 4x4 Limo quot I love the Powerstroke diesel engine  but it is definitely not for everyone  The diesel engine has a very high torque rating of 500 ft lbs  and can more easily tow large boats or trailers than the GM trucks with their existing diesel engine  or the Dodge trucks with their Cummins engine  I know this because I used to own a 1994 Dodge 3500 4x4 with the Cummins diesel engine  The Cummins diesel engine is a great  extremely durable engine  but the Powerstroke is equally durable and has a more modern electronically controlled direct injection system  The Ford Powerstroke engine also meets California Low Emissions Vehicle status  as does all of Ford s Super Duty engines The styling of the truck is also excellent  When driving down the road  you sit about a foot higher than most other similar trucks and SUVs  The drop down window design in the front doors contributes to excellent visibility of any nearby objects  and helps in parking  etc  The optional telescoping trailer towing mirrors are large  extremely useful and adjustable for wider or narrower trailers  The truck has a key locking tailgate  a nice touch  The crew cab seats are very comfortable and the leg room in the back is better than most luxury full size cars  The solid body structure of the crew cab is another contributor to a nice solid and quiet ride The Not As Good Stuff The Ford Super Duty trucks are very heavy across the line  They are between 500 and 1 000 lbs heavier than comparably equipped models from GM and Dodge  My truck weighs 7 200 lbs  full of fuel with no one and nothing in or on it  That is a lot  and more than I expected  Some of this weight is due to the somewhat larger size of the Ford Super Duty trucks  Some of it is because the other manufacturers  GM in particular  have been more aggressive in trying to keep the weights of their trucks down  As a result of this heavier weight  the Ford Super Duty trucks get slightly lower fuel economy when compared to similarly equipped competitor trucks Some people have complained of automatic transmission problems  particularly when towing moving very large loads in extended extremely hard working situations  I have had absolutely no problems with my automatic transmission  There has been some other minor problems that I have heard from others and one recall notice for a minor fix  So  the truck is not perfect  but I love mine very much and wholeheartedly recommended it to others If you live and drive in a crowded major city  parking will kill you with this truck  They are simply large and heavy trucks  and one must be completely honest about what you really need  want and can live with P S  I have a tremendous amount of additional information from my ownership experiences  negotiating and ordering the truck  and from past trucks that I have owned  1992 Ford  1994 and 1998 Dodge and my new 1999 Ford  If anyone has specific questions  please feel free to email me at LVSeng aol com Good luck and enjoy br br  
Pos, I bought this vehicle because I fell in love with it at first site  Then I drove one  and fell in love some more  I am impressed with it s handling it 4 wheel anti lock brakes  This truck is MY dream vehicle I have a 2000 F 250 Supercab  4x4  Lariat  V 10 gas engine  automatic I drive all over the country with my job  in all kinds of weather  and it handles great  The seats are EXTREMELY comfortable  And everything on the dash is easy to look at with out taking your eyes off the road  as well as easy to access  I am a 5 7 quot  woman  I have no trouble getting in and out  I do of course have running boards I usually get 13 4 mpg  but when I drive from Mass to CA  I usually get 13 8 12 0 mpg  And since that is what the computer calculates an average  that means I am getting better gas mileage than that  That is excellent for a V 10 The comfort level of this truck is incredible  I love it  I also love the accessories that Ford offers  such as a rear power sliding window  wood grained dash  front grille guard  fog lights  I know the 2001 fog lights are standard  bug shield  an excellent bedliner  it is one of the best on the market as it is a Duraliner  I also enjoy having a CD player that doesn t hog up my center container  Like the 6 disk CD player in the 95 Ford Explorer does  I love the computer that is standard on the Lariat  that gives the avg  gas mileage  temp  etc  I also like the placement of the cup holder in a slide on the dash  it is very convenient  The drivers cup holder is bigger than the passengers  great thinking I tow a loaded cargo trailer  as it contains all my belongings that I travel with  Like I said I travel with my job ALL OVER THE COUNTRY  My truck doesn t even notice that the trailer is there  This truck is my daily driver If you want an excellent truck  with lots of options to make everyone happy  then get yourself a SuperDuty  This isn t a small truck  but it is worth every inch and pound  If you want to drive the best truck on the road  then get yourself a SuperDuty     
Pos, I bought my second F250 Super Duty Crew Cab in August of 1999  and WOW  what a great vehicle  The 300 HP V 10 engine pulls like a well trained team of mules  the Lariat interior package ensures ultimate style and comfort  the crew cab configuration yields room for six  the 4x4 is almost unstickable  The 10 in V10 is about what you can expect for gas mileage in a 4x4 configuration  The ride is a little stiff off pavement  but very comfortable on the highway  The carrying capacity is more than adequate  as I have hauled in excess of 2500 pounds of feed with no problems  I have pulled a 7500 lb farm tractor  and it was barely noticeable I bought this vehicle because I needed a pickup truck that had room for my family of four with plenty of cargo capacity  We have 7 ranches in Texas  so I use this truck extensively off road  I love everything but the gas mileage and limited fuel capacity  The 29 gallon tank on the short bed model needs to be refilled far too frequently If you are looking for a vehicle that will turn a few heads  carry more than groceries and kids  go off road with style and comfort  and you don t mind poor mileage  this is your truck  Get the Lariat interior  the extra comforts are worth the price br br  
Pos, My ford thunderbird was first car  After a long and dissapointing venture for a used car i finally found my T Bird  At First I looked at a Dodge Neon  yuck  Then a 96  pontiac sunfire  but when i made the trip to Greenbrook to the dealer it suddenly sold and The salesman tryed to convince me I wanted a 98 Neon for  11 000 NOPE When i arrived home my mom was on the phone with my cousin how knew the owner of new dealer and they had a 1994 Ford Thunderbird  The next day I went to see after school  I LOVED IT  I bought it one the spot  PROS The car has great acceleration that never dissapoints me  It is a sports car with luxury  which is what i really love  When i want a sporty looking car its there and when i needed a car to look nice in for the Prom   my Thunderbird Was Perfect  The Front seats are roomy especially the passanger seat  my cousin with a broken leg had plenty of room with her leg straight out  The back is very large and comfortable  i have contemplated sleeping in the car already Though the leg room could be better for such a long car I love the fact that I can set the temp I want in the car  CONS The only thing I wasn t crazy about was the fact that you don t have a vent button its either windows   air  or heat This car keeps me in high Status with friends   
Pos, I bought my 94 T Bird back in 1995 it had 22 000 miles on it  The reason we bought the car was I like the looks and the way the car performed and my wife loves the interior and the power the car has when she sticks her foot into the V8 engine  I also love the car for it s ride and it s handling it has a tight turning ratio for a car of it s size and the speed sensitive steering feels great also  I also like the fuel mileage I get 23 mpg and on a 300 mile trip the car got 29 mpg and for a car that size with a 205 hp V8 I was very happy  About the only thing I don t like about the car is that it s not very good in the snow but with the right tire s it s not to bad  The car now has 82 000 miles on it and it still looks and drives like new I always keep the oil and filters changed and being an auto detailer I keep the car polish and waxed  For who should buy it  Someone that likes a car that is comfy and the performance of a smooth V8 engine and handling to match  Who not to buy  People that hate to drive in the snow     
Pos, My Ford Thunderbird was the first car I ever bought on my own  I test drove it straight to the bank  I bought it used in June of 1999  The seats wrapped around me like a glove  the car looked great  drove great  When I bought it  it had 70 000 miles on it  perfect interior  few scratches  This was luxury for me  It had automatic driver s seat  wonderful interior lighting  and rode like a dream  I also have a child  who rode in a car seat at the time  and i never had trouble getting her in or out  I never had any trouble out of it  other than the transmission needing a rebuild in August of 2000  I absolutely loved this car  There wasn t a thing I didn t like about it  At very high speeds NO  my daughter was not with me instead of shaking or floating  it felt like the car sat down and hugged every curve  My husband routinely drove it to his fire and rescue calls because it was faster and easier to handle than his truck  I  being stupid  decided that I  had  to have a truck  and a brand new one  at that  So  I traded it in October  2000  Trust me  I would kill for another one  maybe a super coupe this time  I ended up giving back the new truck that I had to have because I couldn t afford the payments anymore  I am still kicking myself  because my T bird would have been paid off in July of this year  
Pos, This truck is the best vehicle that i have ever owned  My truck has 103 000 miles on it and never had a problem with this vehicle  I have put two sets of tires on the truck  The first set i put on were cheap tires so i went back to the stock Firestones that it comes with off the assembly line  I have the 2 3L engine  The engine is a little on the slow side but it runs great  It does have some decent power for its size  I would highly recommend this truck to anyone that is going to buy one  And just for some more reference my father owns the 93 Ranger XLT and it has 165 000 miles on it and it runs like a top     
Pos, I recently bought my ranger from a used car dealer  I love it  It has the 4 0 liter V 6  It goes through tires with me like I drink water  It has enough bed space to haul just about anything you can think of  This truck is two wheel drive and it cranks out power  They are relativly easy to work on  I have hauled a 24  Rabalo with it  The down side is the space you have on the inside  I f you are clostraphobic  Get an f 150  I am 5  and have no room  Other than that  I LOVE MY TRUCK br br  
Pos, Talk about a nobrainer  Ford has some pretty good stuff out there and Ford has been around for a long time as a leader in car productions  I bought my Ranger a year ago and is been a great  fast  sporty  trustworthy truck  I have just the basic stock 4 cyl  standard  anti lock brakes  and A C  You dont need more than this to be pleased with the car  But if you want speed  go for the Ranger Splash  They have a 4 0 L V 6 and they haul  Over all Rangers are one of the best compact pickups for the dollar  The one and only down side is they re just what they re called  compact  If you re tall or need some extra space for cargo  get an extended cab for sure because there is no room in a single cab     
Pos, Want a valuable truck without the gas guzzling  Buy a ranger  This is my second ranger and I haven t even parted with my first My original 1994 ranger has over 150k miles and still runs like new  I just bought the 99 for a fresh start but I will keep the 94 for work purposes In both models gas mileage is excellent  Out of the 3 years I have owned the 94 I only had to pay for general maintenance  The only downfall is that it lacks in power  it takes a little to get the speed up there but hey at least it helps from not getting any speeding tickets If your in the market for a light duty inexpensive truck that will last a long time  I recommend highly checking out a ranger and talking to other people that own one br br  
Pos, I am a big Ford fan and I have done some serious research on the new 2001 Ford Ranger  I learned that Ford has come up with a new trim package called the Edge that falls between XL and XLT packages  With this extra package a customer now has much more options to choose from  With this new package  Ford is adding special features in hopes to satisfy the needs for the young and active customer   quot What makes the Edge Ranger so different from other Rangers quot  you might ask  Well  to start off the 2 wheel drive Edge has the same amount of ground clearance as the 4 wheel drive Ranger  This feature allows customers to have the 4x4 looks without the high prices  Fog lamps  bed rail protectors  and front tow hooks are equipt as well  Air conditioning and a cd player also come standard in the Edge package with a 6 disk changer optional  The 3 0 liter engine comes standard in 2 wheel drive with your choice of regular cab or super cab and style side bed or flare side bed  I currently own a 2000 Trailhead Ranger that shares many of the same features as the Edge  including the 4x4 look  I am completely satisfied with the power and performance that it provides  Although the 4x4 lifted look causes a slightly rougher ride  it is well worth it just to have the  quot BUILT TOUGH quot  look that it has br br  
Pos, I have never been so in love with a vehicle  I just bought a used 2001 Ford Explorer XLT in wedgewood blue and it doesn t everything but brush my teeth for me b Interior  The interior is roomy without feeling like a huge machine  Everything you need is comfortably within reach and intuitively placed  No looking in the glove box to find the fuel door like on my  89 Mustang  The fan set on the coolest setting is just as cold as if the A C were running  The seat has several electronic controls for the perfect fit  The passengers in the backseat have access to climate control and radio adjustments  The trunk  however  is the best part of the interior  It has it s own floormat   what a riot  There is an exceptional amount of space and a clever roll out shade to conceal expensive items from potential thieves b Exterior  I find that the Explorer is attractive but modest  I think the two tone paints gives it extra class  I highly recommend the running boards  At 5 5  I need the boost  I m also enjoying the motorized sunroof  While I am still adjusting from driving a small sedan  I don t have trouble fitting into tight spots or trying to park  The Explorer is a nice compromise when it comes to size b The Rest  True  gas economy could be better   I get 15 miles to the gallon and drive a mixture of highway and city miles  However  I don t find that to be unreasonable for the type of vehicle it is  The V8 engine is responsive and gives the vehicle all the get up and go it needs  It can definitely get out of its own way  The handling is smooth and does not feel tippy at all  I drove a Tahoe once at thought I d roll at any moment For anyone looking at used SUV s  I highly recommend you test drive an Explorer  Don t be distracted by the fancy looks of the Xterra or the image of the Jeep Grand Cherokee  The Ford Explorer is the best value for the dollar in terms of performance  comfort  and size  And they look good  too  
Pos, This is one of the best cars that ford has ever made This 91 Taurus has been a great family car for us since we bought it We ve put over 80 000 miles on it and it s only been in the shop once for minor repairs It has been a very dependable car throughout the years There have been a few recalls on it but they were not major ones Overall this Taurus has lasted us longer than any car we have ever owned It s great for driving in snow and on ice has lots of moving room in car The engine and transmission is still going strong without any problems I use to hear and read many reviews on a Ford Taurus about how they were the top seller every year and I strongly agree with that I love the power steering cruise control and the front wheel drive I will always stick to buying a Taurus because it s worth every dime  I highly recommend anyone out there that is looking for a dependable and long lasting car buy a Ford Taurus because they keep going going going br br  
Pos, I bought my 91 Taurus from my parents because the prize was right and I knew who owned the car before me  I have had nothing but problems with this car  1  The light blue paint on the 91 Taurus is defective  It will rust leaving you with a nice tri colored automobile  2  The air conditioning is famous for breaking and for a mere grand  you can fix it  3  There is a problem with the motor for the windshield wiper so it can come on an off when you operate the turn signal  I have owned a 90 Taurus as well and encountered exactly the same problems  I will never again own a Ford Taurus  My parents recently purchased a 2000 Taurus and immediately it began making noises and the dealer essentially said  quot Deal with it quot  If you are looking for a reliable used car from the early 90 s  DO NOT buy a  90 or  91 Ford Taurus br br  
Pos, This is a wonderful car  I bought mine as a used car and it was still in wonderful shape it has way over 100 thousand miles on it and it still runs like a dream  This car doesn t require much maintnence  Does good on gas  and oil  Has good  quot get up and go quot    runs smoothly when going down the road at any speed  This is a must buy car  If you are looking for a good car choose this one it also has plenty of space in front and back seats  Most have options such as power seats  power windows power steering and more I really can think of nothing negative about this car  I really enjoy it  Parts are easy to get at any car parts place  also parts are not very expensive to aquire br br  
Pos, I own a  97 Explorer XLT that s in the body shop for two weeks  The other guy s insurance company is renting a new Explorer XLT for me until mine is done   CHECK OUT MY REVIEW OF THE  97 MODEL    Life with Explorer  All I can say is  I m impressed Ford has the good sense to be content with minor tweakings of the very popular Explorer  This latest incarnation of the XLT version is certainly evolutionary  but not revolutionary compared to my middle aged  97 model The outside stylings are more angular  with a front face that looks modern  yet also is somewhat reminiscent of the  Aero era  headlight design that almost all Ford cars had in the late  80s  particularly the T Bird and Mustang The model I m driving has spotlamps in the bottom of the outside mirrors  When the doors are unlocked with the key fob  these outside lights   along with the interior dome lights  turn on The first thing I noticed when entering the vehicle  is the redesigned door handles  They no longer pull up  rather the whole handle pulls straight out  sort of like an old latch refridgerator  The keyless entry keypad is now arranged vertically on the door  aft of the window  On the inside  the door locks are no longer stalks on the top rear of the door  but are now toggle switches near the inside latch handles The mirror controls threw me for a moment  rather than the slide selector  you now turn a knob to select which mirror to adjust  The tilt wheel adjustment is a fiasco  and so far the only thing I don t like about the  02  It s a large lever that must be turned 90 degrees to adjust the steering wheel  and must be manually returned to the starting position before exiting the vehicle  or else you bang your knees on it on the way out The radio  CD  A C controls are very similar to what I m used to  The dashboard  while still functional  clean and uncluttered  uses an odd  italic  font that I don t like as well as what I m used to  but that s purely subjective There are better cupholders  and handy bin for fries or sunglasses or a cellphone in front of the cavernous bread box of an arm rest bin  There is a power outlet in front of the bin  which helps keep phone charger cords out of the way  There is also a power outlet in back  for the kid s CD players   Gameboys  The tissue dispenser had been eliminated  but a large clip is on the underside of the bin lid to hold the tissue box there  It s easier to change tissue boxes  but not as easy to access the tissues when driving  For those of us with small kids  that makes a difference  to the rest of you it s probably not anything to write home about The outside temp and compass have been moved from an overhead display to a small display that s part of the electronic odometer  It seems this has eliminated the tendency of the old design to register higher than the actual outside temp on very hot days  This was due to the old design s thermometer being influenced by cabin heat The rear storage area has more useable floor space  because the rear wheel wells are not as intrusive compared to older Explorers  Also  the retractable cover is situated higher  allowing room for taller objects to be carried and still remain hidden under the cover  It appears the tailgate window no longer opens independently from the rest of the gate  I found the ability to just open the window very handy  especially when loading groceries I have not attempted to use the rear seat  although just knowing it s there is nice  There are occasions when seating for five is inadequate  It s a nice option for those of us who dread a minivan  especially if seating for five is adequate more than 75  of the time The model I m renting has a V 8 engine   which provides plenty of ZIP from a both a dead stop and for freeway passing power  My truck has the big V 6 and while it s acceleration is not bad  it s clearly not in the same league as the new model  The engine runs quietly  and the transmission shifts smoothly  when it should  The 4WD drive system retains the  Auto   High   Lo  selector  although it has changed from a dial to a three push button arrangement The ride is much more car like than in my  97  There are fewer bounces and it s relatively quiet  There is some roll when cornering sharply  but that s normal for truck based SUV  
Pos, I recently used a 2002 Ford Explorer XLT for a week and I really enjoyed driving it  The instruments and front passenger area is very well laid out  it drives very well and it has plenty of space for a wide variety of things  The cupholders and nic nac trays are easy to access and the stereo is easy to use and figure out  I don t really like having a third seat in this vehicle  as the seat seems kind of out of place  I would think if you haul around that many people  you probably need a suburban or an expedition  I would prefer a more level  and taller  storage area  With the third seat laid down  the storage area tilts down toward the tail of the vehicle and it seems a little awkward The model I drove had leather seats  a CD tape player and it had keyless entry  I like having keyless entry and I especially like the ability to open the back hatch with it  The leather was very new and it seems a little  tacky  but I am sure it will break in and smooth out  This vehicle seemed to have lots of options  cruise  leather  keyless PW  PDL  fog lights  thermometer and compass on the dash  but I would like to see heated seats  cold leather is the worst   I have heated leather in my 95 Pathfinder I found the explorer to handle very well in the rain and the steering cornering feels very smooth and manageable  The explorer also has a tight turning radius  which really helps around town  It turns considerably sharper than my Pathfinder  I don t know what wheel tire combinations you can get with the explorer  but it seemed like it wasn t really designed as an off road vehicle  Maybe bigger tires would help  It is more like a big station wagon that handles well and has 4WD for driving on snowy roads  My Pathfinder feels more like an off road truck and I enjoy using it on the back roads and in the woods  but I would be afraid to go to many of those places in the explorer Since I am one of the few people who actually use my SUV off roading  I would think the qualities that I don t like should attract a lot of  soccer mom  types who enjoy a stable ride with lots of room and excellent function My friend has a 97 explorer and I have to say that this new version drives better and is probably more versatile it s people hauling ability  
Pos, I purchased this Ford Windstar in February 2001  I just put 34 500 miles on my 2001 Ford Windstar SEL after returning to Michigan from Florida  It s a very comfortable ride with an excellent suspension  high headroom  good legroom  well thought out ergonomic controls  front driver and passenger airbags and rear passenger side airbags  It has independent adjustable climate controls for the rear with a rear climate control shut off in the front control panel  It has power everything including two power sliding doors  8 way power driver s seat with power lumbar support  2 driver memory  power adjusting gas and brake pedals  and traction control  Other goodies include turn indicators on the outside rear view mirrors and warning lamps when one or both of the power sliding doors are activated  an electronic compass  external temperature read out  automatically dimming rear view mirror  trip timer  engine message center  and low tire inflation sensors  I did not opt for the entertainment package with the 5  LCD viewer and the VHS DVD player This van came with the keyless touchpad entry feature on the driver s side door  daytime running lamps  and quad seating with a third bench seat  The exterior color is a two toned with a deep  emerald green and lower gold accent trim  The interior is a dark parchment with cloth seats and wood accents trim  The only difference between this SEL and the Limited series were basically the solid paint schemes  leather  heated  seats and wood accented steering wheel Whereas Chrysler offers their minivans in two basic body styles a short and a long wheelbase  the Ford Windstar comes in the long wheelbase model only The Windstar has surprisingly quick acceleration  Maneuverability is so so with the long wheelbase  The ride is very comfortable and quiet  The van holds the road very well and handles wet  slippery roads easily with the long wheelbase and the traction control  entry and exit is very good  The engine is loud if you floor it  but under normal driving conditions  the van gives a fairly quiet ride The Windstar has many niceties including a small shelf to hold things like a cellular phone  a center console with cup holders and storage for CDs and cassettes  holders in the driver and passenger doors for maps and other stuff  and a pull out shelf with two more cup holders  The overhead console provides very good interior lighting  a mirror to watch the kids sitting behind you  a compartment for eyeglasses or keys  a coin holder  a holder for a remote  and  as a really nice touch  the top of the dash is textured to eliminate glare and reflections off the dash onto the windshield  An extra power outlet is in front by the passenger side and a rear power outlet is at the liftgate  the two middle seats have cup holders and the rear seats fold down for extra room for cargo  The two middle seats and the third bench seat are removable  The third seat has little hooks in the back to hook the handles of plastic grocery bags into to keep the bags from moving around and spilling their contents  I also received a cargo net for the rear to keep items from shifting  The built in Homelink remote on the driver s visor easily adapted to my garage door remotes  The visors have lighted mirrors  Interior cargo space is very good  allowing me to remove the back seat and put in several pieces of luggage  a bicycle  and scuba gear including two air tanks  I had to pack everything carefully  but it all fit nicely However  the third bench seat weighs approximately 70 pounds so it can be a two person job to take the third seat out and put it back in  Fuel economy is somewhat disappointing  My fuel economy with this Windstar averaged 24 6 MPG with 89 octane mid grade fuel  Economy is a little less at 23 8 MPG with premium 93 octane fuel  The Windstar s V 6 engine is more than adequate for mountainous driving  I was impressed with the van s performance on Interstate 40 driving through the Appalachians  Braking is adequate enough to quickly decelerate the 5 600 van  in my opinion  I m not a professional driver so I can t honestly evaluate  in technical terms  braking characteristics  The anti lock brakes do work and keeps the van under control and from skidding  When the anti lock brakes take over  you ll see the icon appear on the instrument cluster and the brake pedal will pulsate  You ll also hear an unsettling grinding or crunching noise  but this is normal  Also  when the front wheels start to spin and the traction control activates  the traction control icon appears on the instrument cluster and again  you ll hear that unsettling grinding or crunching noise  but again that is normal  the traction control can be manually disabled by the driver The automatic transmission shifts smoothly and unless you re looking for for it  you can hardly tell when the transmission shifts up or down  The transmission cannot be disengaged from Park until the brake pedal is depressed and held  The road noise is low inside the van The van seems to collect road grime  salt and slush on the rear window so I find myself using the rear wiper and washer frequently  This is my first van and I think this is inherent with all vans and SUVs A well equipped Windstar costs about as much as an upscale luxury sedan but is much more versatile while retaining many of the luxury features  I wish Ford would jazz up the pedestrian instrument layout and dash  I also noticed that water will fall on the door controls if the windows are cracked open while I am driving in rain  Overall  I m very satisfied with the Windstar  It has lived up to nearly all my expectations  except fuel economy  If Ford ever builds these Windstars with all wheel drive  then the Ford Explorer will be in very big trouble  
Pos, I drove this van for nearly a year after my first car got stolen  and let me tell you  what a piece of work  I proceeded to drive it like a NASCAR  but it held up  with a spectacular V8 engine supplying all of the horsepower i needed for my various missions  Let s talk about interior  This beauty had everything  mood lights  fully reclining seats  a fold out bed in back  a cooler  curtains  and a cable TV hookup  among various other things  In essence  it was  a van of the gods  with no other vehicle before or since  with the exception of my Cadillac  even coming close to matching its splendor and pure sex appeal  It was asthetically marvelous  with boxy but smooth lines  and a ladder on back in case you had to get up on the roof for something  Don t turn corners too fast  or it will tip over  If all of this doesn t make you teary eyed with joy  you are either a  an alien  or b  a communist  Plus it has alloy wheels  and you can install tables in the middle and back seat rows  If anyone ever claims to make a more feature ridden behemoth  they are lying  A definite buy  
Pos, I have always though of Ford as a crappy  non reliable company but ther Ford Explorer seems to always be good  What do they do different I have no Idea  I love this car though  It drives great and it could very well be the top truck in the country  atleast in my eyes it could be  I recommend this truck to everyone and it is a pretty good price also  It drives great on rough terrain  I go out to cape Cod and bring this truck through the beach and it drives great through there  I am telling you  this car is awesome  if you are smart you will listen to me You may think like me and say   quot  Ford is a crappy company Im not buying form them quot  but this is one hell opf a truck  and I suggest you get it br br  
Pos, We are the proud owners of a 1999 Ford Explorer XLT  We purchased it because we wanted a vehilcle that can handle western New York winters  carry two adults and two older teenage sons  and pull a large  quot pop up quot  camper trailer  At the same time  I didn t want to sacrifice gas mileage as you do with larger suvs  So far  we have been quite pleased with the Explorer  It pulls our trailer  about 2000 lbs  without a problem  with only some loss of gas mileage  When not towing  gas mileage averages around fifteen miles per gallon  or slightly better  Although it doesn t have the soft comfortable ride of our old  89 Crown Victoria  the ride quality is pretty good  With the SOHC V6 engine  there is some noticeable engine and road surface noise   nothing more than you would expect with a truck The vehicle handles very well and is easy to park and maneuver in parking lots  After driving an extended  94 Aerostar mini van  the Explorer seems much smaller and easier to navigate  However  we do miss the third passenger seat and the additional cargo space of the larger Aerostar  But  we have taken several longer trips  300 or more miles  with the Explorer and have managed to have enough room for luggage  cooler chest  Christmas packages  etc  When my wife are using the vehicle around town  we love it for size and convenience There has been one recall so far   replacement of the secondary hood latch which was handled promptly by the dealer  Just last week  we noticed that cold air seems to be coming in through the left rear door speaker  The dealer corrected this by adding insulation to the door  no charge  Overall  the quality craftsmanship of the vehicle is quite good Overall  if you want a SUV that has decent gas mileage and is smaller than the Expedition  Excursion  or Suburban  the Ford Explorer is a good choice  If you need larger towing capacity  or want more cargo capacity  then you will have to sacrifice gas mileage and go with one of the larger vehicles 1 14 2000 Update Well  winter driving has arrived in western NY  and today I found out how well the Explorer handles on slippery  snow packed roads  and I am very pleased with the results  On roads that were somewhat slippery for my Aerostar  the Explorer felt very stable and would not skid or fishtail when I pushed it a bit  So  I ll update this review again when I get a chance to play in some deep snow br br  
Pos, I bought my Eddie Bauer Edition of the Ford Explorer a little over a year ago and I love it more every day  This was purchased to replace an older car and a lot of thought was given to the SUV vs car dilemma  I opted for the SUV for the flexibility it offered ie hauling moving things without having to rent a truck  camping  etc I really love the luxury of the Eddie Bauer Edition  The leather interior  great factory sound system  nice lines shape  It is wonderful to be able to see over traffic and not feel  quot boxed in quot  by larger vehicles  When I ride in a car now  I really feel like I m dragging on the ground  There are a couple of downsides that I wasn t really aware of  but can live with  They are that unless you are riding in the drivers seat  it can feel like a fairly rough ride and when the streets are slick  it does tend to slide more than a car  This is controlled by just slowing down a little more than you might on normal street conditions safer anyway  This is one of the best purchases I ve ever made and definitely the best vehicle purchase of my life  I will most surely be a repeat buyer br br  
Pos, My parents own a brand spankin new Ford Explorer and I can not believe the extra qualities it has compared to other SUV s  My parents bought this vehicle because of its overall power and luxury  It has a big triton V 8 engine that provides enough power for this vehicle  On our Explorer we have the Eddie Bauer package which adds more luxury inside of the vehicle which is almost to much to better  I think that the options this vehicle gives you are almost unreal  It also comes with a 4x4 package which is nice for the winter time or if you want to take this vehicle off road  I recommend this vehicle to every person looking to buy a very nice SUV for a reasonably price br br  
Pos, Stright and to the point  For a 4wd station wagon it is great  I was a truck user and had been for years  thought it was time to move up to a SUV  Biggest mistake I ever made First lets talk about the great things that the Explorer is  It is a great family car  It has a super ride  The interior is very plush  The sound system beyond anything I ever needed  The handling and ride superb  Lots of cargo space for luggage for trips  or for carring the groceries  Now dont try to help someone move with it because all your going to put in it are the small boxes  I used mine to help my daughter move from one apartment to another  Way to many trips  took forever  Own a home and need to do some lumber hauling  golly don t want to get wood slivers in that nice carpet or just cant get that 4 x 8 sheet of plywood in the back  I would highly recommend this SUV to anyone who is looking to buy a station wagon or a really nice family car br br  
Pos, IU think that the explorer should atleast have the 90  mark on this chart not the 87  that like a B  and i personally would give it a A  its one of the smartest  I purchased my Explorer on Jan 5 99 i have had it a year already and i have to say its excellent it rides like a baby and i love that  i truly would recomended this car to anyone who wants something that will last practically forever and very dependable on the road i enjoy my 4x4 espicailly when i got exactly what i want for only 27 125 00 for it   GET one today youll love it   you will be very safe in it in all the crash test ive read 2 companies said it was a  quot excellent quot  and 3 said quot good quot  and 1 said acceptable and other than that NO poors or marginal thats great  i want something that is safe and well assembled  very carefully put together GET ONE TODAY br br  
Pos, I recently purchased the Ford Explorer and quite honestly have never been more satisfied with a vehicle purchase as I am with my Explorer  Upon my test drive of the Explorer I noticed a very highly detailed interior which is both driver friendly and easily navigated  I was very pleased the with the power in take off as well as the vehicles ability to pick up speed once already moving  The seats are comfortable and adjust easily  One concern would be the history of the manufacturers past failures  but to this point I am thoroughly satisfied  The capability of this vehicle to corner is also very surprising SUV s are known to be dangerous in higher speed maneuvering but the Explorer and Ford has seemed to located and lock in on the center of gravity for this vehicle  This is definitely the SUV all families or truck van enthusiasts should consider when shopping for a vehicle br br  
Pos, The Ford Explorer is probably the most ideal SUV manufactured today  It s the perfect size  both inside and out  I am a school psychologist who travels about a school district that is over 900 square miles  so I log many  many miles weekly  The Explorer is very comfortable and easy to drive  The interior is nicely arranged with all knobs and handles easily within the driver s reach  There are also controls in the back seat for the music system and air conditioning and heating system  The rear cargo area is ideal for transporting my equipment and testing kits  leaving the back seat for passengers  Of course  one drawback is the tendency for this vehicle to roll over in an accident  but it is equipped  standard  with two airbags and seatbelts  which should be worn at all times  On the positive side  the Explorer rates very high in overall safety and in crash tests  the drivers AND passengers in the Explorer have fewer injuries and deaths than most other vehicles  I drive mostly highway miles  but I find the gas mileage to be very competitive with more economy minded vehicles  It requires very little upkeep maintenance and retains its  resale  value very well  For the money  it s quite a bargain br br  
Pos, When I buy a vehicle  I start with the purpose I want it to fulfill  then I look for vehicles that can handle the intended uses at a reasonable price and in a reliable manner  I wanted a vehicle that could carry a fair amount of cargo in an enclosed space  could handle deep snow and slippery roads  and could tow a trailer or boat  I looked at the Grand Cherokee  4runner  Montero Sport  and Explorer as well as reading about others  The Explorer had the most space  a convenient 4wd system  good towing capacity  a proven reputation  and the best pricing  When a dealership offered me  1000 below invoice in an honest upfront manner  with 0 9  financing  that closed the deal One year and 17 000 miles later  I am still pleased  And my wife enjoys driving it also  It is a truck  but a very refined and well equipped truck  We have an XLT with 4 0 SOHC engine and moonroof  I live close to the Canadian border  It starts fine in  20 degrees  it drives well on unplowed snowy roads  and the anti lock braking system works as designed  Driver visibility and maneuverability are excellent  better than I expected in an SUV  We can easily carry groceries  pets  lumber  up to 11  sports equipment or whatever inside with plenty of space  We have towed heavy trailers for about 1500 miles during the past year at highway speeds with absolutely no problems  Thus  it has fulfilled our purposes We have had no mechanical problems  only normal maintenance  Gas mileage has been 15 19 mpg  which is not good but about what most equivalent SUVs also register  My only complaint has been that it is difficult to keep the underside of the vehicle clean during winter when snow  mud and salt splatter up underneath it  There are many irregular spaces between parts and panels where crud can get lodged  rust and corrosion would be expected to result  Thus  I spray it clean often during such weather  The spare tire is also exposed underneath SUVs do not get as good gas mileage and cannot handle emergency maneuvers  i e  rollover avoidance  like a sedan  Thus  they would not be my choice for a crowded commuter expressway  The Explorer is not highly rated as an offroad vehicle  other SUVs with a shorter wheelbase and more ground clearance may be better  But  if your purposes are similar to mine  the Explorer would be a good choice to look at     
Pos, Woohoo  I love this thing  It s way better than my Ford Mustang that I have  I have been driving my 99 Ford Explorer around quite a bit lately and I ve noticed that I can hit curbs  I can drive through the snow at speed limit  I can run of squirrels and not notice them  I could probably even take out a frew children in a school parking lot and never know  However  I wouldn t exactly call that a selling feature It s got some amazing pickup  It s V 8 makes it faster than my Mustang in pickup  but not in the long run  It would kill my car off the line  Snow is not a problem for this beast  I ve been driving in some great Michigan snow so far this year and I haven t slipped at all  Now  one issue is getting hit from the side  well  I m absolutely positive you d do a rollover if hit from the side  this thing almost rollsover when going through mountains after being hit by a heavy sidewind  It s big  but it doesn t have a very good center of gravity  thus making it an easy target to rollovers or other problems  But  if you get hit head on  or from behind  you will more than likely live  with it s cushy seats and major safety packages  It s also fun to play with  I love the little thing that tells what direction I m going in  normally called a compas  but it s just a thing when it s in a vehicle  I guess  It also tells you the temperature outside  the heat comes on really fast  it has all kinds of cool little things I can do with the seat  including tilting and deciding how high I want the seat  and how soft I want it  REALLY COOL I definitely recommend this baby  Go buy one right now  don t look at anything else  especially the 95 Mustang  it s flawed greatly and I know  I own one   br br  
Pos, The key to a  good  Ford Explorer  is to  explore  the history first  Know what you re buying  people  I currently have 52000 and change on mine  Check with Carfax regarding the car s history  If the dealer will not  go elsewhere  Ford is known for quality  so they claim  so this should not be an enormous undertaking for them to do so  Ford s ultimate motive is to sell  sell  sell  Like everyone else  Customer service should not lag behind  Unfortunately  it has for me  If the CS was even adequate I would have gladly put up with the little problems I have endured  My rear windshield wiper has a mind of it s own  So does my fuel gauge  It has become mandatory for me to reset my trip odometer and fill up every 222 miles  Easy enough to remember  Ford said they will be happy to do an  exploratory  check on the problem  There word really 100 to tell me it s a  3 problem  I know  it s like that everywhere  All the same it s still irritating  as the mechanic said this with a snicker  And no not the candy bar  For me  the problem is not the vehicle  it s the people selling and fixing the vehicle  Fortunately  the selling is over on day one  It s wise to make friendly with your local mechanic down the road  Trust me  The vehicle I own is of the  Sport  breed  It fits me perfect  I am 6 2 on my tippy toes  Nice headroom  leg room  hip room  etc  Rear seat room is sufficient for short trips  Knee and hip room lack  but I don t have much need for the back seat  Well  ya know what I mean  With the seats folded flat  very nice for hauling pretty much anything you desire  I am not one for third row seats anyway  They tend to limit the second rows knee room  And see very little use anyway  For all you 2002 owners with your third row seats they are of course not leather  Come on Ford  you re selling your top end Eddie Bauer and Limited models with leather  while using vinyl for the third row seating surface  I don t know about you  but if I am paying  36K and up  that would not fly with me  Vinyl  Anyway  back to my ride  Great acceleration  Awesome 5 speed tranny  Take a spin  people  in a 4 speed automatic  and you will instantly appreciate your Explorer that much more  Above average suspension  Very good brakes   ABS  Fuel economy is not all that  but I and you should expect that in any SUV  A bit on the tippy side when strong winds are a blowing  Minnesota winters can be nasty on occasion  And when it s windy be on alert  This of course  carries over from the Bronco II model  An Explorer Sport is basically a revised Bronco II  which were known for there compulsion to do the 2 wheel tango  A bit more stable with this model however  The side step rails that come with the Sport model do tend to rust  I suggest waxing those while you re waxing the body  It may help a little  I was considering the purchase of a new 2002 Explorer Sport After thinking back on the lack of CS  I quickly came to my senses  On the  02 model  I just can t get passed the plastic bottom  I realize most cars are plastic in this area  but at least they are painted plastic  Call me picky  it just looks cheap  And now Ford is cutting costs even more by moving to a plastic fuel door  to which was once metal  I am sure Ford has stocked up on there inventory of this part  Very easy to snap off if one is not careful filling up there tank  One last thing  Ford s extended warranties  I did not purchase one with mine  Here is why  I previously purchased a 1998 Ford Mustang GT with 46K on it  Three years old at the time  Problem after problem  my fault for buying a used 0 60 car  I know  But  there were so many problems  and not one item was covered under the warranty  It is safe to say  if you decide on purchasing an extended warranty from Ford  mine cost  1100  it will cover the engine  the tranny  and the drivetrain  That is it  Everything else is thrown under  wear and tear  Be prepared for a few headaches if you need to use it  Not to mention trying to get a loaner car from Ford  Holy nightmare  Six times in 3 months I was in for repair  Nothing covered under warranty and I had to call at least 7 days in advance for a loaner car  Not to handy when you need repair asap  is it AGAIN  it s wise to make friendly with your local mechanic down the road  Unless Ford can improve greatly on the CS this will no doubt be my last Ford  For me  quality in the vehicle is equal to quality customer service  Love the ride  just not the ride to the dealership  
Pos, I purchased my 1999 Ford Explorer 2 X 4 SUV in May  I have had severe back surgery and needed something that was elevated in height so I could get in and out easily  I needed something that was big enough in the back seat where my two small children wouldn t constantly complain  quot he she is touching me quot  The seats fit my back wonderfully and there is so much room in it not only in the front  but in the rear passenger area  Now  let s talk about the cargo area  When I go to the Sam s Club to purchase bulk items  I don t worry about where I am going to put everything  There is so much room  plus I have the option of folding down one side  or both sides  of the rear passenger area to make even more room  On one particularly lengthy trip  my husband and I folded down the rear passenger seat  spread out the children s sleeping bags and they were as happy as clams at high tide  I am absolutely thrilled with my SUV br br  
Pos, The 99 Ford Explorer Sport is a FUN  fairly affordable  and safe vehicle  It is easy to drive and rides very smoothly for a truck based vehicle  The inside is easy to use and looks nice  complete with fun and handy compartments and buttons  Because there are so many options  it is very individual and suits personal needs  I bought the car over other SUVs because of its wonderful safety records and have been very impressed with its performance since  Contrary to belief about 2 door SUVs  the back is very roomy and comfortable  It has everything i need br br  
Pos, We bought the Ford Explorer because it had more room than the Mazda Protege we used to own  I absolutely love my truck  My husband and I bought it with all wheel drive all the time  I like the way it rides  it feels like we re riding on a pillow  The only complaint I have about it is that it guzzles gas  but that s because in order to get the all wheel all time you had to buy the V8  The V8 has awesome pick up its the 5 0 engine that used to be put into a Mustang  It s a lot of fun to drive  The people who want to buy it is someone looking for a bigger vehicle  It may be a little more expensive than some other Sport Utility Vehicle s  and that might make a person not want to buy it br br  
Pos, I am a recent buyer of the Ford Explorer  and out of all the car s and suv s I ve had this has been the best one yet  It has an extremely smooth ride and gets pretty good gas mileage for an suv  Best of all  depending on how you look at it  I was recently in a car accident with it  and by looking at the car  you would have thought I would have been seriously hurt  but I walked away with just a few bruises  The car has been repaired and it drives as good as ever  Knowing what I know  I have much comfort driving  Ford Explorer has been good to me br br  
Pos, First I must point out that the estimated price for this car is wrong  I own one and the base price with no options starts at  26 390  Mine has every option except the leather which was a free option  but since I live in the heat and I hate hot leather on bare skin  I declined the leather  This car is made in very limited quantities of about 3000 per year and commands a particulary aggressive type of owner  The car runs a 13 9 second quarter mile in stock trim and is good for about 160 mile per hour top speed  I put the Vortech supercharger on mine the week I bought it as well as some aftermarket suspension parts from Steeda  This was easily the best money I spent on the car as it only continued to get better  Driving this car has got to be as fun as the owners of the original 1964 thought  because not only is it one of the best looking American made cars on the road today  but it is also one of the fastest  I have had it to the drag strip three times now and have run a 12 6 et 121 mph pass with the stock tires on the car and a full tank of gas  Now you motor heads out there do the math  At 3300 pounds that makes this car a 500 horsepower monster  The fastest stock production vehicle on the road today is a twin turbo Porsche 911 at  110 000  I own an American car that is a half a second faster at a mere savings of  75 000  now what could be wrong with that  But even better is the driveability and the mileage  On long freeway trips with the cruise control on I average 25 26 miles per gallon  thats 2 better then my wifes V6 Taurus  You will be hard pressed to find a more reliable car with this kind of performance  At 35 000 miles I have changed the oil and the spark plugs only  Thats it  No minor or major mechanical problems even with the aftermarket parts I have put on  This is indeed a fine example of American engineering and beauty  If you are looking at a used 97 or 98 Cobra  I would encourage you to buy quickly  This car is a very driveable rocketship  A Viper eating  Porsche embarrasing American made musclecar that is as beautiful as it is fun  Turns heads at every corner and the rear wheels at the drop of a hat  Every stoplight becomes an adventure and every gas stop becomes a conversation  This car never fails to turn heads and on the rare occasion that you see another one the freeway  you are gauranteed to see a waving hand and a smiling face I cant say enough about this car except that I would buy it again today  even at full price  It is worth every penny  Thank you FORD  
Pos, We own a 1998 Contour SE equipped with the 24 valve V 6  The car was built in October 1997 and we have put 30 000 miles on it since we bought it new We compared the Contour to the Honda Accord and Nissan Maxima but found those models a little out of reach for our budget  We also drove the Dodge Stratus  Pontiac Grand Am  Ford Taurus  Mazda 626 and the Nissan Altima  Although those models were similarly priced  we did not feel that they could match the Contour in drive quality  performance  interior ergonomics and exterior styling  We purchased the Contour knowing that for less than  17 000 we were getting an attractive American car with the features we wanted  We made the decision that while the Accord or Maxima might have better build quality and lasting resale value we could not justify the  3000 to  5000 premium The car drives like a more expensive sports sedan  The smooth V 6 has a lot of power to offer at any speed and the suspension is tuned to give the driver a lot of confidence  The ride quality suffers as a result  but we knew it would  We do wish the car had more interior room  especially in the back seat  Do not plan on taking long trips with adults in the rear seats  After 3 years we still have things to like about the car  but there are some things that must be considered if you are looking at buying one  We have gotten used to the ample power the V6 provides and the sporty handling  in addition  we still find it to be one of the more attractive cars in its class There have been numerous malfunctions that have required dealer service  Ford has issued 5 recalls for this model for different reasons  The check engine light came on  but that is a common problem on all cars with current emission control systems  The fuel filler tube to the gas tank inexplicably became constricted to the point that it took 10 minutes to fill the tank  The most troublesome thing we have experienced is that there are pieces of trim that cover the jack points below the doors that will not stay on  We have noticed that there are a lot of Contours on the road with the same problem  They cost roughly  15 each  All of the other problems were covered under warranty As annoying as any trouble with a new car is  we have taken it in stride  We still feel that the car was a good buy and plan to keep it until it has about 75 000 miles on it  You might not want to consider this car if you plan to put fewer miles on it than that because the residual value on Contours is not good  On the other hand  if you can find a low mileage used one you might save yourself some money Overall  I would say that we are happy with our decision based on the choices we had at the time  There might be a better model today  but put the Contour on your list and at least give it a test drive br br  
Pos, Despite the criticism the Contour has received  I ve found the car to be fast  comfortable  and a joy to drive  It seems that they got just about everything right in the  98 model year  and it missed the major decontenting that occurred in the  99 and 2000 models  For just over  9 000 in early 2001  my  1998 5  I still think my 20K mile  1998 5  Ford Contour SE V6 was a great buy  The SE trim level also features traction control  ABS  and other features that are great in the winter  and aren t found on every car at this price level  I ve found it handles great around curves or daily driving  while acceleration is quick and responsive  I m sure the V6 helps in this regard  I ve never driven the Zetec 4 cyl  but I understand some feel it s a bit sluggish in a car of medium size like the Contour  Whatever the case  the 170 horses put out by the 2 5L Duratech are plenty  and highway cruising  lane changes  and quick acceleration prove no problem At higher speeds  the engine is a bit loud  although many like it that way  so it s just something to consider  I tend not to notice as my upgraded speakers and subwoofer prove to be a nice way to drown out the engine noise  Speaking of that  though  consider yourself warned if you plan on adding speakers or other upgrades  the contour isn t the easiest car to mess around with  Each of the 4 stock speakers are in the doors  none in the rear deck like most cars  which means taking the entire door apart to replace them  Routing wires and such is a bit of a pain as well  as Ford has chosen looks  i e  concealing screws and wires in very difficult to reach locations  over upgradability  For most people who don t bother tinkering with their car  or who relegate that task to the specialists  it shouldn t even be an issue Unfortunately  I can t give any hard info on reliability or long term performance  as I have only owned the car just less than three months  But in that time I have drove it regularly and its always performed as good or better than I expected  Gas mileage is good  but not great  however this is my first car so I have no basis of comparison  However  I d say its probably about the same as most other cars with a similar sized engine  in the 20 25 mpg range  the 30 mpg highway rating from Ford is probably a bit too optimistic The interior is quite comfortable  and the 8 way adjustable power driver s seat is a nice touch  a memory function would have been nice  though  The interior lighting is a little dim  the car would have benefitted from a centrally located  dome light  which I understand is on the Mystiques and may have been on older model Contours  Rear seats  as most have said  aren t the most spacious in the world  but I don t see them as much of a problem at all  Adults will definitely fit  although it may not be comfortable for very long drives  not really any different from just about any mid size car  though So  what are the real flaws  I haven t found any yet  besides the fact that Ford  and especially the Contour  doesn t have such a great reliability reputation  I haven t had any problems so far  however  and hope it ll stay that way  It s probably worth it  though  knowing that I saved a few thousand dollars over a same year import car  you know  those  reliable  Hondas and Toyotas  Watch out for that depreciation  though  while it means I was able to get a great deal on the car to start with  it also means I can t expect much a few years down the line when it comes time to sell it  It s a trade off I m willing to take  though So yes  the car has its flaws  As you can see  though  most of them are relatively minor  and overshadowed by the car s great performance and price  After reading up on probably dozens of other contenders  I ve come to the conclusion that just about ever car in this price range will have a host of minor flaws and negative points  The 1998 Ford Contour  of all the cars I have looked at  puts forth the best combination of looks  performance  and features with a minimal of problems for under  10 000  
Pos, A little backstory  In my family  we buy cars out of necessity  In this case  the 1989 Chevy Corsica had its last dance at the auto shop and was costing more than its utility  if on average I m spending more on repairs every month for the old car with no payments than I would on a newer car with the payments and higher insurance premiums  I ll dump the old one  Time to shop  We found a 1998 Ford Contour SE with 10 000 miles on it  Now  I knew of the horror stories about this car  the endless parade of recall notices and all of the repairs that follow  The guy who sold it to us  it was his father s before the he pasted away   and I think the family had more affection for this car than they did for the old man  had all of the service records showing that every recall  something like 8 or 9 of them  had been addressed and that the car was regularly serviced  I figured the rough patches in the car s history were over and that anything that could go wrong with the car already did  That was in March of 2000  For two years and 26 000 miles  or 36K miles on the car total  we have not had any problems beyond the usual wear and tear  Visits to the shop have been limited to routine maintenance  front end alignment and a new set of brakes and tires On the Powertrain Suspension  It s the SE w  the 2 0 liter  4 banger  Although the acceleration on the 4 cyl  w  auto trans  is relatively weak  it handles very well and the braking is superb  All Contours have independent suspensions and rack   pinion steering  My SE has the 15 in  alloys and 60 s all around  Put them all together and it s like I m glued to the road  A word about drivetrain choice  The 2 0 I4 w auto trans   overdrive lacks punch in the low end  I can t be too aggressive getting on the interstate or weaving through traffic  I ve had this type of engine in another car  Mazda 626 with a 5 speed manual  so I believe it s the tranny that s the problem  trouble translating those 125 horses to the tires quick enough  If I had my druthers  I would prefer the 2 5 liter 6 cylinder SE or the SVT  And  the combination of higher horsepower  195 horses in the SVT  and the road handling of the SE or SVT would surprise most BMW 3 series owners  On style and fit  The 1998 model look more like a shrunken Taurus  than the econo box Escort  Overall the Contour has very clean lines  even if it s a little generic  But  you can always tell the Contour from the rear end  though  The light cluster and combination of reflectors and chrome reminds me of the Lincoln Continental  just shrunken down  The seats are supportive and  overall  the interior design is very clean  The flip down seats in the back and the roomy trunk are big pluses  too  I ve got my roadside repair kit  golf clubs and diddy bag back there  but  I still have room to go grocery shopping or mall hopping        Side note  Okay  you re asking  what s a diddy bag   it s the backpack where I keep a change of clothes  shower stuff  and my golf shoes  I confess   I m a horrible golfer  but rarely pass on a chance to play  With that bag in the car  my answer to anyone who asks is always  sure   I ll play      Beyond being under powered  my only substantial complaint about the Contour is the interior noise  The cabin has poor sound insulation   road noise is excessive  Overall  Overall  the car is a real prince  It has a charming personality with just enough styling  comfort and handling  It s a shame they stopped making these little go getters in the US  Ford dumped the line and makes the Mondeo in Europe  the Jaguar X Type and the Mondeo are both cousins of the Contour  There are some notes about buying a used Contour  though  1  Take the SE or SVT over the GL or LX trim levels  The GL s and LX s that I ve seen  read about  and driven  seem chintzy inside and don t handle as well as either the SE or SVT  2  Get the 2 5 liter 6 cyl  over the 2 0 I4 if you can  You will be so much happier with the added power  3  Check the service records before you buy the Contour  or any used vehicle for that matter  If you re buying from a private person and they don t have the maintenance records or can t tell you where it was taken for service  be very careful  something ain t right  4  Get a warranty  If you re buying from a dealer  don t skip the extended warranty offer  And  if you re buying from a private person  check with the finance manager at your local Ford dealership  like the dealer that maintained the car for the previous owner  to see what they will do to put you into one  At a minimum  think about getting an engine and drivetrain warranty to cover you for as long as you re making payments on the car  you will thank me later  5  Be religious about vehicle maintenance  Fords tend to be very spiteful when you neglect them  In another year  I ll be getting a new car  We have the mini van  see 2000 Chevy Venture review  but we won t be getting rid of the Contour  My wife will take it back and forth to Annapolis and she insists that it will be the perfect car for our kids to have for their first vehicle when they get their driver s licenses  That s at least three years away  But so far  I can t say that I disagree with her  
Pos, Bought a Ford Contour SE  January 1999  Decided to take it on vacation to Maine  We are from Branson  Missouri  The Contour was very economical  comfortable and a joy to ride and drive  The spunky 4 cylinder engine took the turnpikes like the big boys  Was really impressed with the acceleration onto the ramps  The design of the windows lets you view a lot of the outdoors  which also made it very enjoyable  I would recommend a Contour to anyone who appreciates economy  smooth ride  and sorta of a sporty look  I feel the  s certainly out number the  s  One of the  s is that there was some road noise  not really irritating  but had to turn the radio up louder than I m used to playing it  and another was the airbag light malfunctioned  We drove from eastern Pennsylvania to home in one day  16 hours and because of the comfortable ride we arrived home not too tired and not at all beat up from the long drive  Ford Contour you have my vote and also my next vehicle will be a newer Contour Dwight Rogers  Branson  Missouri   
Pos, We bought a 1998 Ford Contour in 1997 and at first were so happy  It is a smaller car  but with 4 doors and a good sized trunk  it was roomy enough for our family of 3 at the time  Then slowly things started happening  First the air stopped working  then we would get things in the mail every few months or so about a recall on the car  Once it was the head lights  another time the breaks  and another time the air conditioner  The seat belts are constantly getting jammed and with 2 kids and a seat belt law  we need our seatbelts to work properly  Ford was always happy to fix these things as the car is still under warranty  but it is just bothersome to have to keep taking it in and being without a car for a few days at a time     
Pos, If Ford had really taken this car under their wing  it truly could ve been the  World Car  they were hoping it would be  But with ads seemingly only placed in  Woman s Day  and  Parenting  magazines it s no big surprise sales were poor  In other parts of the world  namely Europe  the Mondeo  their version of the Contour  has done reasonably well and the newest model has won accolades since it s inception  So  it is possible for Ford to build a great car  but it seems recurringly impossible for them to bring it to the U S  without butchering it  With that in mind  you should definitely consider a Contour if you happen across one during your search for transportation  Understand  though  that it helps if you re a  car person  when you drive it  Why  Well  that s hard to explain unless you are a  car person  This car  in every trim level  handles like a dream  If you happen upon a  Sport  model or  SVT  you should definitely take it for a lengthy test drive  If you find a Zetec  the 4 cylinder model  and it s a stick shift  play with it in the high RPMs  The test drive will be more enjoyable and convincing if you can find a nice  twisty road to experiment on Listen for things like engine howl or strange rubbing sounds coming from the wheel area  Wheel bearings are a common failure on this car  as are water pumps  Do your best to find out if the water pump has been replaced  If the car is over 60k miles and still running the original water pump  you may want to consider replacing it  They have a habit of breaking internally  which can result in engine failure if you don t catch it soon enough  I happen to own a Contour with the Zetec engine  I have replaced the water pump  but that s about it  The car is very comfortable on long drives and I really stress the engine everyday  With regular maintenance   notice I said  regular  maintenance  not 15 000 mile oil changes   the car should last you until you re ready for something else  Take care of it and it ll take care of you If you happen to own one or are seriously looking to buy one  stop by http www contour org and visit us  That s the website for the Contour Enthusiasts Group and we ve ran across and fixed almost every problem you could face on a Contour  Hope to see you there  
Pos, I have leased a 1998 Contour GL for 2 years and will have to decide whether to buy or lease it or another car in October so I have been thinking about the car a lot  My model is a 4 door  4 cylinder automatic  with cruise  pw  a c  It has been an excellent car  no trouble for 23 000 miles  It handles very well  and I haven t seen the need for the available larger engine  though all the pro reviewers say the 6 cylinder larger engine is smoother  I used to have a BMW 325  and this car s handling is not as good as that  but it is better than my Audi 100  for example  I know that the Accord gets better reviews but I just cant complain about this car  It is quiet  and trunk space is excellent  the space in front is fine  Rear is not huge but ok for kids or short trips with adults br  
Pos, Highly affordable  was a key factor in initial purchase  Warranty very much considered as a premium value  Appearance  comfort of ride and roadability  Great selection of installed options  Economic to operate  We have experienced  three recalls to dealerships  Fuel filler neck would not accept fuel about the second week after we purchased the vehicle  Dealership where we purchased the vehicle  disassembled the right suspension  exhaust  and fuel tank and we made about 10 trips to different dealerships trying to get noises created by the repair of the fuel filler neck  We finally gave up and we now here the noise when we descend across a flaw in the surface the road bed br br  
Pos, Best decision I ever made was begging for this truck for my graduation present  When I found it it had 38 000 miles on it and was sitting used on a new car lot  It was a 95 xlt  Came with 5speed and 2 3 liter four banger  regular cab  longbed  and am fm stereo casette  60 40 split bench  and Ford Bedliner  not bad for 8 grand  All the goodies a college freshman could want  Sometimes I wish for the 3 0 or 4 0 liter 6  but I m more than satisfied with the power my engine makes  It helps that it s a 5speed so that it s easier to make the most out of it The interior is great  comfortable  and I dont ever want an aftermarket system because the 4 speaker 80 watt system that s stock makes good enough sound that I just added an rf modulated CD changer and will wait till Im making more money and have a new truck to make serious upgrades  You gotta put it on full blast to get any distortion  and the base is impressive  You d have to be blind  with no manual dexterity and fingers the size of pickles to have any problems operating anything while driving  In fact  i was able to memorize the dash layout so I can turn any switch without taking my eyes off the road in no time  The defrost works very quickly  You can see it start to kick in in a few seconds  I d like to see the cupholders placed differently  They sit at the base of the shifter  on the transmission hump  I have to reach way too low to grab sodas  I ve seen S10 s where the cupholders retract from the front of the center console  I d like to see that setup in the Ranger  I d also like a different manual door lock design  As it is you can t unlock the doors on a non power lock ranger without opening the door because when the locks are down they are recessed all the way in their holes in the door and there s no way to pul them up without opening it  Space is good for me at 5  8 quot  but it is not a truck for people above average height  I ve had passengers wish the seats had a few more degrees of recline  There s lots of storage with a center armrest doubling as a storage bin with slots for coins and a pretty big glove box I dont know why peole complain so much about the 2 3 being gutless  Get it to rev to the sweet spot between 2500 and 3500 rpm before you dump the clutch or shift in every gear and and those 4 cylenders pull pretty damn hard and I almost forget im even driving a four banger truck engine till it runs outta steam after about 3000 rpms and the engine whine becomes noticeable  Part throttle at low speeds in first and second gear gives a healthy push  Drive it right and it ll jump off the line pretty agressively  I know I ve certainly never had to beg my way off of an expressway onramp  Of course I would never want this engine with an automatic Highway passing though is a little different  If you don t need to pick up speed quickly at all  you ll get by in 5th most of the time  The engine will pull OK in 5th on flat or very slight grades  If you want to casually dart into the fast lane to make a pass and need to accelerate from maybe 70 or so to 75 or 80  youll need 4th  But to really pick up speed fast  like from 60 or 65 to 75 or 80 and get out of a tight spot or jump into the fastlane without slowing anybody down you wont get any real acceleration above 3rd gear  But then again that s with most vehicles and I ve never found myself lacking for power when I really needed it The breaking is just as almost as good as on my parents  Corolla  Stops are short  without any fishtailing and not much nose dive  I ve had to do panic stops in rain and still never felt like the truck was getting away from me  Handling is pretty good to  The Firestones grip very OK  but I think I have the suspension design to thank for the handling more than anything else  Ride is OK with big bumps or smooth roads  it s a whole lot of small bumps close together that upset it  The only time you have to be careful is fast bumpy corners or wet turns  where it reminds you it s a truck when the rear end does the jitterbug or slides a bit when unloaded  At speed the steering is accurate with little free play and nicely weighted  But in parking lots you ll have to twist it a few times to get out of tight situations  IT s also extremely useful  Though I have a base ranger with pretty low payload it s hauled everything I ve ever needed it to  I somehow packed everything I own in it for the 2 hour drive to school  We chopped up a tree that fell in our lawn in the last storm and holled the logs away in only a couple trips  I even threw 24 cynder blocks in the back while making a quick run to Home Depo with a friend  Through it all  with only the basic recommended maintenance  I ve had no engine problems whatsoever in the 1000 plus miles I ve put on the truck  I get about 18 mpg in mostly highway driving  but Im 19 and have a leadfoot so dont let that scare you Real world range has stretched to over 250 miles with 16 5 gallon gas tank  Anyone who drive like a sane person can probably expect closer to mid or high teens in the city and 20 25 on the highway There are some annoyances though  95 was a pretty bad year for elecrical systems so if you want a used ranger get one from 96 on  Interior light sometimes stays on for up to 45 minutes after I get out and occasionally stays on the whole time im driving  Wipers are posessed  sometimes they ve come on without me turning any switches  Remember to put that parking break to the very VERY last notch before you get out and maybe even leave it in gear  otherwise it ll roll  Armrest is starting to come loose from the seat  And the hard plastic steering wheel is very slippery  sliding right through the hands in tight turns  The Ford Bedliner has started to loose it s grip on the bedrail in a couple spots  The latch meckanism on the sliding rear window can be flimsy  Ive locked the keys in the truck and been able to get in with a screw driver  so you might want to put a lock on it or look for one without it if security is a concern  I really wish I had gotten one with air  I think more should be standard in the xlt package Basically I love this truck  all the important things are done right  there s just some minor annoyances that I can easily live with  Good  economical  useful  stylish transportation Since I got it I have added a 6 disk CD changer and various cosmetics such as body color matched tail light covers  blacked out headlight covers  ventvisors  bug deflector  shade blade  and soft tonneau cover  some know what all that stuff is and some don t but suffice it to say when I learned about the huge custom product market available for puckups I went nuts and I probably still haven t finished Update This is an update to a December opinion I wrote over a year ago about my new Ford Ranger  It s been 55 000 miles and the engine has performed almost flawlessly  It s only hiccup was a winter day in subzero temperatures in which I stalled by slipping the clutch too quickly and it took a few tries to get it started back up  Other than that I m never disappointed when I turn the key and have never been left stranded There are some annoyances  some small  some large  My temperature gauge dies on me at about 48 000 miles  Usually when this happens it s a sensor that must be replaced for about 18 dollars  It s extremely rare for the actual gauge to die  Lucky me  The dealer quoted me 360 dollars to replace it  That will have to wait  It does not affect how the engine runs so I will have to do without it because that s alot to a College kid The brakes needed to be replaced at about 55 000 miles  a little earlier than what I m used to but then again I do tend to drive like teenager because that s what I am  I also had to make a few panic stops  So I had the pads replaced and the shoes remachined at Pep Boys  which seemingly did good work  Their brakes seem to bite better and make for better stops than the Ford units  though they were very good I didn t particularly like the Firestones  which gave out too early in the corners and rode roughly  so I replaced them at 51 000 miles with Goodyear Laramie touring tires  which aren t well known but did a better job of smoothing the ride and sticking in the corners  The firestones weren t really done for yet but I happened to have money at the time and figured it would be wise to replace them when I could rather than wait till they were bald  when I might not have any money  Ahhh  the precarious income of a college student On the inside the interior light goes off when it s supposed to about 80 percent of the time  and the rest of the time when it gets annoying I pull the fuse  A sensor in the door probably either needs to be replaced or cleaned off  Also  the on off button on the radio no longer works properly  so the radio stays on all the time  The driver s side window squeaks when lowered  A lubricant will probably help The paint has held up very well  There is no fading or peeling  only the normal scratches and dings from everyday driving  The bad primer and flimsy finishes that plagued pre 93 Rangers is no more The best fuel range with the 16 5 gallon tank is now 287 miles  but I think there s the potential to do better and maybe surpass 300  I put fuel injector cleaner in with the last tank  I also think part of it is that I m a little scared to dip too far into that reserve past E  but I m gonna go for it and update on the mileage soon So aside from new brakes  which has alot to do with driving habbits  and new tires  which I didn t really need  this truck has not demanded any other money for the most part except for cool stuff I pput on to personalize it Mileage Update  5 20 00 I just finished off a tank that was about 60 40 highway city driving  I drove it from when the tank was topped off at 16 5 miles per gallon until past E with the fuel light on  for the best range yet of 315 miles  probably with a few more left  That s roughly 19 mpg  I know  I know  less than what most would expect from this type of truck  but keep in mind that s with my jackrabbit starts in the city and 75 85 mph cruising speeds on the highway  This tank looks even more promising  as it is at the half way mark and it s already taken me 180 miles or so  I expect low 20 s when I tabulate it  Update  Range this time around with 60  highway cruising at about 75 85mph and around town driving came to 318 miles total exactly from top off until I lost my nerve after having driven several miles past when the low fuel light came on  The bed cover stayed down almost the whole time and I definitely thinks it helps me gain one or two mph  I m going to try to be even more conservative in my driving with this tank and see if I can break 320  I m thinking it probably won t get much better than low 20 s overall no matter what I do  Maybe a K amp N filter will snag me another mpg  One thing s for sure  I don t know how those guys with the half ton and three quarter ton pickups deal with 30 40 dollar fillups once a week  Update  57 800 miles 7 1 00 So far so good  no big problems  never any hesitation on startup  The clutch feels just as strong as new  I think they put particularly good ones on the manual transmissions in this truck  The parking brake has another inch or so of give when you put it on and realease the foot brake  The same minor electrical annoyances persist  The stubborn interior light  whose fuse was pulled  and the gauges that occassionally act up  though thankfully they stull are functional  There is some steering pull to the right under hard braking despite the fact that there are only 10 000 miles on the brakes and I got an alignment about 4 000 miles ago  Fuel economy has stayed the same at about 19 mpg mpg  though I haven t gone from tip off to near empty in awhile so I m gonna try it again soo and see what happens  The check gauge light comes on quite often though I have it serviced regularly and nothing has been found wrong with the truck  Really hard bumps seem to trigger it quite often  95 was such a bad year for electricals  The big 60 000 mile service is coming up  with belt replacements  inspections  etc  I may shop independant mechanics to get a better deal on the more expensive stuff  Pep Boys is a possibility  I ll report back on how smoothly it goes soon 7 15 00 Mileage Update I just went through another good full tank of 16 5 gallons for 332 miles  or about 20 1212 mpg  with what seemed like a good 15 20 miles left  The fuel light had been on only a few minutes when I finally filled up  I think my numbers should have been at this level from the beginning but it has taken me awhile to get up the nerve to dip into that reserve past E and get as close as possible to an almost empty tank for an accurate reading without stranding myself somewhere  This tank was about a 50 50 mixture of hard accelarating jack rabbit starts and stop and go city traffic and 75 90 mph cruising on the highway with occassional downshifting to fourth  There were also ocasional traffic jams and highway slow downs  Some have criticized my truck s mileage  But I think averaging about 20 mpg is pretty good for a lead footed pickup driver  I also think there was still a few miles left and believe I could have reached 345 350 miles total on this tank  for about 21 mpg  If I drove more gently at all times  which I am sure I probably never will  25 overall should be reachable     
Pos, I have to say that the Ranger is possibly the best purchase I ever made  And I also have to say it was one of the safest I ever made  I had a 1995 Ranger XLT  And unfortunately I wrecked it  It was a nasty accident  but I came out with only a scratch  So it gets my vote for safety I loved the truck because  though it was small  it served it s purpose well  and was NEVER in the shop  It was incredibly reliable  The 2 3L  4 cylinder  was a little under powered  though it got good gas mileage  The best I ever got was 33 mpg  I had an aftermarket exhaust on it  and I removed the intake silencers  which helped both power  and mileage  The 33 mpg was steady driving at 55  I ve heard that s a little rare  but if you don t mind going a little slower  and are gentle with the throttle  it s not out of the question The only thing I didn t like about the truck was the small cab  An extended cab would have solved this easily  The long bed would have been a little better for hauling  too  But with the standard cab  and short bed  I kept the weight down  which helps mileage  and helps the 4 cylinder get going a little better I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a truck  They re stout  and are VERY reliable     
Pos, I d been riding a motorcycle exclusively for eight years  when I decided the time had come to get back on four wheels for awhile  The mean streets of Phoenix  Arizona are not known for their kindness to two wheelers I had looked at a number of sporty cars  and I was also considering a pickup to help out with the household chores  After driving a bike for so long  the  fun factor  outweighed practicality and the truck idea was shelved The muscle car era was over before I got my first license  but there are still a few cars out there that continue to capture the spirit of the original pony car The 2002 Mustang GT incorporates the long hood  short trunk style of the first 64 1 2  Any  Stang enthusiast will also recognize the channel extending from the front quarter panel to the rear simulated brake scoop on each side  The  dual cowl  dashboard and mustang emblems on the seats also evoke memories of the classic Ford ponies Unfortunately  both the brake scoops and hood scoop are tacked on for show  While that previous era Cobra Jet could claim some performance gain from increased air flow  all these decorations get you is a more difficult time washing your car  Water just loves to adhere to the hood scoop honeycomb front and release after the hood is dry  With typical Arizona hard water  this will leave long water streaks for you to clean again  I find the  02 brake scoops overdone  while the previous years I found stylish There are 2 GT models  the Deluxe and Premium  I found the Deluxe quite acceptable  and in fact have only one added option  the Mach 460 sound upgrade  When I bought the car I wanted no options  but the only black 5 speed manual on the lot had the 460 sound system   460 stands for 460 watts peak output I must say  factory car audio has improved greatly since my last car  I m one who traditionally ripped out the factory system within days and replaced it with something listenable  I have no such desires after 2000 miles of driving in my GT  With a 6 CD changer in dash  MP3 compatible  plenty of speakers and all optimally placed  I have enjoyed this system far more than any other I ve ever had  The DSP  effects  are worthless  but there is one set of modes I ve found invaluable  Setting for  Driver Only   All Seats  or  Rear Seats  really does work as advertised  and perfects the sound for those areas You won t be using  Rear Seats  much  unless you have a dog or children  The backseat does not have enough legroom for any normal sized adult  The driver seat is just big enough for my husky 5 11  frame  but I would imagine it s tight for those over 6  The driver s seat is powered and firmness can be adjusted  but it feels like a compromise   some comfort  some support The GT Deluxe comes with 17  alloy painted wheels  This means a bit more care when it comes to cleaning them  but they look great  You ll appreciate them if you re a fan of curvy  mountain roads  ABS and traction control also add to the feeling of control when pushing this car  but if you just  have  to do a big  tire smoking burnout and fishtail  you can disable traction control with a dashboard switch Make no mistake  the GT is fun to drive  The dual exhaust provides a throaty  reassuring feedback whenever you step into the gas pedal  It is subdued enough that you won t be annoyed by it during everyday city driving  You can always crank up the tunes if you opted for the Mach 460 sound  there is an even better Mach 1000 option I do have an unfavorable reaction to stoplights  With the hot summers and excessive traffic in Phoenix  the asphault near stoplights is often heavily worn  Startingly deep ruts appear in the road surface at times  While all vehicles have a tendency to follow these ruts  a biker s nightmare  the Mustang seems to me a bit worse than normal in this regard  It tends to show the most during a firm brake for a stale yellow light About 80  of my driving is stop and go  city traffic driving  I get 19mpg just about every tank  On a long trip I once broke 23  and the very first tank was 17 I am absolutely happy with this purchase  I love driving it  and I have been spoiled by seriously fun motorcycle driving  It looks great  and though the car gets it share of attention  you don t look like you re having a mid life crisis or compensating for something  I hope Ford continues to manufacture this pony for a long time  as this style gets harder and harder to find  see Camaro  
Pos, I bought my 2002 Mineral Grey GT at June 1st  I had owned a 1998 GT and loved the performance for what is classified as a mid performance vehicle  When I bought my new car I expected nothing less  I have been doing a lot of city   highway driving and I must say that I m very impressed with the mileage for an eight cylinder  22mpg  On a highway trip this last week  I averaged 25mpg with the AC running very impressive  On the performance side it s a bit too soon to tell  I like to break my cars in a bit and don t like to push them much before to first oil change  I actually bought this car for less than I paid for my  98 and it comes with a few additional features that the  98 didn t have such as traction control  anti lock brakes and a 6 disc CD changer  Ford had don t a first class job holding the price on this car in the last four years  I honestly believe that this is probably the strongest contributing factor to the Mustang being the  ruler  of the performance car kingdom for the mid performance level cars  Fords continues to improve this car at every turn  The quadra shock rear end design along with the other structural traction improvements to the rear end makes this car a good handler on the highway and on twisty roads  This car is significantly quieter and quite a bit more  sticky  on the road than my  98 too  As far as overall power  so far I m quite happy with the pick up  I have also noticed that the  sweet range  for this car is in the sixty plus mile per hour range  This is where I can definitely notice the additional horsepower over my  98 All in all I would have to say that this is my favorite Mustang of the two I ve owned so far  
Pos, I am loving my 2002 premium coup mustang  I have the silver body with the dark charcoal interior  I must admit however  after owning a white 1998 pony  I was disappointed to see the interior had not changed much at all  The same simple  plain interior options were a let down  in that they were boring  The interior seating has seemed to change  in that it is more plush and classier  I did not go for the leather  but I am thinking more  I should have  Ford should seriously rethink the interior options via the dash  My 1998 had an option where you could have the fan placed at your feet and upper body at once  that option is out in the 2002  I will state I am in love with my sound system  For a factory system  it is not sheepish at all  It thumps base like I have 15  subwoofers and the 6 CD dash changer is also lovely  The options to customize your tunes and their sounds is also nice  The only drawback  assuming cassette tapes are not used as much  is the 2002 model I have  does not come with a cassette player in the dash  the 1998 model did  but it also had only 1 CD you could have in dash  I am the typical mustang enthusiast  I love the throaty deep growl the car possesses and you can even get this without upping the extra  3000 4000 for the GT model  I like the smoother than normal ride for a sports car I get from my Stang  but the rear wheel drive can be tricky  especially in rainy weather  The ABS and tracking system Ford has installed  kind of gives a little more peace of mind to the driver  I was also blown away at the horses on this engine  The V 6 is powerful  although not as powerful as a matched model of some other  pony  cars  but it is punchy  My 1998 was a five speed  but I could only get the paint and interior I wanted in automatic  which does not totally disappoint  but take off can be draggy  This car seems more  sedan like  than the older models  The long hood is still there and I happen to like the over sized scoops on the premium coup models  Bottom line  this is a sexy car that moves just as sexy  just be careful on the slightest curve  Wear your seat belt  so you won t feel you are being thrown out  
Pos, First of all  I live by myself in a dorm in downtown Austin  There is little or no parking available where I live  and most of the places I have to get to are within walking distance  Also  I have a couple of friends that always seem to be willing to drive me around  Because of these reasons  I really have no need for a car I have owned a few  however  Actually  it was mostly partial ownership  as my parents technically bought them and just let me drive around in them  I ve used these cars enough to form an adequate review  I believe  and that is what I intend to do right now The Ford Mustang has always been a great looking car with relatively decent gas mileage  about the same if not better than previous 4 cylinder cars I have used  In particular  I love the  94 model s style when compared to the earlier and newest models  This body style will be a classic  for sure  Passenger wise  it is a great single or two person road trip vehicle  In the three years that I had access to it  it proved itself to be very dependable and still ran great  in spite of having 70 000 miles on it  when we traded it in  I did not consider myself then  nor do I consider myself now a car aficionado by any means  but this was one of my favorites of the cars that I drove  My complaints are minimal  I don t like to drive fast  so the fact that it s 3 8L engine doesn t have the sound or power of other cars didn t affect me much  although my  quot friends quot  made quite a joke out of it  It can still beat most cars off the line with a 5 speed manual  but drops into the backfield rather quickly  Another thing I noticed is that bugs tend to take off too much paint on the hood and front bumper  not to mention the pealing and chipping of the paint right behind the wheel wells  Mud flaps would dramatically fix this problem  The body dents very easily  which can be very costly to repair  The interior is not the quietest place I ve encountered  and the rattling and squeaking noises can be an annoyance  As the car approached the 70 000 mile mark  I began to get a little concerned about the rumors drifting around about head gasket problems on this model  But my fears were unfounded  the inspector didn t even find any minor gasket problems when we turned it in This car was bought for around  10 000 and it is certainly worth the money  as far as I am concerned  It may not be the fastest car on the road  but I loved this car and would recommend it to anyone who asks br br  
Pos, A diamond in the rough  This car is a dream to drive power comes on smooth as silk and goes till u let um reving out at 7000 rpms this little rocket gives more than enough power to pull out on the highway or cut some corners on your favorite back road  Once in a corner u can grip the whell and push the peddle down till your nerves give in with no worry baout losing control of traction i have driven many sports cars includeing 4 chevy corrvetts years 1990   91   94  95 all owned by my father and the PRobe GT may not have top end or pick of the beast of a car the vette but it sure can make u stay in your seat and hang on for your life in tight corners   
Pos, I bought this vehicle primarily for the prestige and looks rather than reliability or rating  Overall  I am happy with my mustang  though she is and can be tempermental  I was amazed at it s affordability and comfort  I must stress COMFORT  The seats are perfectly contoured to my body and the steering wheel isn t one of those hard skinny ones  which I hate  When I get in it and start driving I feel like I could go on forever  You really must at least test drive one of these cars  Your standards of comfort will be forever altered The overall vehicle is very easy to maintain with relatively few problems  My car has 74 000 miles on it now and I am just now having to replace a few parts here and there  Nothing major or highly expensive  Just a wheel bearing and the brakes from normal wear and tear The mustang would even make a good car for the family  if you don t mind the two door as opposed to four door for loading the kiddies  The airbags are of the design that would not blow up in your face  but rather split down the middle  Only the airbag itself makes contact with you  I know this from personal experience   The ride for the most part is generally smooth sailing  although being low to the ground  you really have to watch curbs and pot holes more so than in another vehicle  But  the looks alone would make up for that br br  
Pos, I have been driving my 1994 Mustang GT Convertible V8 5 0 for about 8 months  It is a beautiful car and a pleasure to drive with it s power and great handling  It is as fun to drive as it is attractive  It s a car that you can drive and actually enjoy yourself  Ample room for four but small enough to fit in those all too prevalent compact car parking spaces Now for the downside  in these 8 months of joyous driving  I have been hit 6 times  Once I was sideswiped  twice I was rear ended at traffic lights and three times I was hit while parked or stopped in a parking lot Maybe I have bad CARma  But I really feel that a bright red convertible draws more cars to collide with them  It acts as a magnet to other cars bumpers Another problem the car has is that in many 93 95 Fords  the transmission has been known to slip an operation which costs about two thousand dollars to repair and I am currently undergoing the operation for the third time  this time under warranty  thank heavens So the transmission slips  and cars seem to flail wildly about when they are near this one but who cares  It is a beautiful car  made to run on 87 octane  which saves money and now is very inexpensive to buy  Buy one  keep it for two years  and then sell it  just so you can have the experience of driving this fine piece of magnetic metal br br  
Pos, My 1987 Ford Taurus GL station wagon was purchased new in Columbus  Ohio  This vehicle has been a very solid  reasonably reliable hauler  The large and versatile cargo area adds incredible utility  enough to fit a full sized bicycle without taking the wheel off  The car is comfortable to drive  and the handling is really outstanding for its day  Remember  this is the car that saved Ford and wowed the world with its Audi class handling and driving dynamics in 1986  The 140HP 3 0L Vulcan V6 is rock solid  but delivers tepid acceleration  Brakes  no ABS available  are no better than adequate  but the car handles predictably even in adverse conditions  We ve used Goodyear Aquatreds  which certainly help in the wet and snow  Highway ride is pretty good up to about 75MPH  after which things become loud and jiggly  The speedo only goes to 85  after 16 years  this is not a speeder Reliability and durability have been surprisingly good  BUT  this is a Ford  and keeping up with maintenance is important or it ll come back to bite you  Long term problem areas include  alignment issues  tires wear out rather fast in this heavy front drive car  issues with random stalling   but it always started up again immediately or within minutes  and coolant system problems  The car is not happy in continuous stop and go city traffic  and can overheat and spill coolant  Rust is a big factor in the older vehicles  stay ahead of it  or it will attack doors and rear wheel wells  Original generation Tauruses are said to have problems with A C and transmission  A C no problems  but rarely used  but transmission has slow leak after 140 000 miles   and I think could be busted up much faster under hard acceleration  Good news  parts are cheap and plentiful  Insurance costs are low  The wagon has been used to tow a 1000lb  trailer without issue Personally  I think the original 1986 1995 models are the best looking wagons ever produced  the smooth  proportionate  aerodynamic shape influenced EVERY car produced since  This car is still good looking after 16 years   people are amazed when I tell them how old it is  These days  a 1987 Taurus can be a good choice for either a durable  inexpensive beater or a piece of American automotive history NOTE  My car has low miles  140 000 over 16 years  regular maintenance  and easy driving style  
Pos, I used to own a 2001 Mustang convertible but had a terrible experience with the dealership  not the car  and fortunately got them to buy the car back  it was THAT bad  I might review this experience in the Mustang section I decided to give Ford a second chance and since in the meantime I had adopted a 100lbs  dog I decided to take a look at bigger vehicles  With the Ford Escape in mind I went to a different dealership  While leaving the lot to take a Midnight Edition Escape I glanced at a bunch of little Focus Station Wagons and finally left the dealer in one of those The dealer had none of these wagons with manual transmission  traction control or airbags  so despite the fact that I was willing to pay the extra cash for such features I had to leave the lot in an automatic Ford Focus ZTW  This was way back in August and since the car is almost 5000 miles old I believe I can make a fair review The car is very well equipped for the money  Lots of space and nice unexpected features everywhere  Although the engine power is rather modest the wagon is kind of fun to drive due to great on road dynamics  Fuel economy not as good as advertised but pretty decent and improving with time  Now its making about 23 mpg So far I have not experienced any of the problems and mechanical failures that many people have reported here  Just a very annoying squicky noise in the rear that hopefully the dealership will be able to take care of when taken to the 5K service The front wheels are permanently dirty due to fast fading brake pads I suspect but so far the braking power has been adequate and enough I really like the instrumentation and the interior design  There is storage space everywhere in the cabin  Inside  the car feels much larger than it actually is  The only objection to the interior would be that the seat cushions feels short  I am only 5 148 and not heavy and in long rides the seat makes its presence known  I mean a seat cushion is not something you should think about unless its really good  I don 146t want to think how a larger guy would feel after an hour in one of these My dog loves the car and hopefully the trauma of riding in the minimalist back seat of the Mustang is forgotten and forgiven The other day I was looking at a sales brochure for the European Ford Focus and couldn 146t believe how spartan the American version is when compared to the one over there  Features like climate control  better headlights  chrome inside door handles  hood lock  backseats headrests  No wonder is the best selling car in Europe The initial quality problems plus the failure to offer many of the features offered in Europe cemented Focus 146 reputation as a very unreliable cheapmobile  bad for Ford and even worse for the owners whose resale value will be greatly affected  I own a 2002 version in which most of the problems supposedly have been already addressed but I suspect that such fact will be of little help when the time comes to get rid of my ZTW  In the meantime I am enjoying the ride and the money saved Focus is a very good car that Ford consciously failed to make a great car  Only they know why  
Pos, In 1996 my husband and I  having just recently had a baby set out to get ourselves a new car since the  89 Escort we had needed some work  Not having a lot of money we decided to look at used vehicles  The car dealer had a few  94 Ford Aspires on the lot and we decided to try them We test drove a nice  burple  color one as it became known to us since the color was a cross between blue and purple  We went and talked price and drove away the proud new owners of a 4 door  94 Aspire The interior of this car was roomy enough for our family of three  My husband is tall at over 6  and never had a problem in this car  This car actually seems bigger then the Escort to us Many people have complained about the power in this car  While we found that you could not expect 0   60 very quickly it did perform well enough for us  I mean we are not racecar drivers  The only thing was to get enough merging power we would have to turn off the A C  This car diligently moved us from California to Louisiana and then to Alabama with no problem  Our biggest problem with the car   The windshield hummed at any speed over 55 Unfortunately  at 60 000 miles  a large promotion  and the thought of another child we decided that it was time for us had come for us to trade our Aspire for something larger with more options  It was a very sad moment for us as we had seen a lot and done a lot in that Aspire of ours  She had never let us down  We traded her in and said our goodbyes and before we even took delivery of our new car her new owners who bought her right after we traded it in were driving her out  We watched her drive down the road and I must say it was like watching the end of an era for us On a lighter note  we do see our Aspire around town every now and then  It always perks my spirits to see her  Even better yet  it means she still is running br br  
Pos, I bought my Ford Aspire in 1994 brand new off the lot  I paid  9000 out the door  I had cruise control and a stereo added and later replaced it with a CD player  At first I didn t like the car  the interior was plain  the engine had no get up and go  and I had to put up with the wise cracks about how I was driving a washing machine on wheels  But now 6 years later I still have the car  my husband drives it now  and with 125 000 miles on it the car is still going strong  500 miles a week commute  I have put 2 brake jobs on the car  changed the tires all around 3 times  changed the battery once  had one tune up  and recently replaced a rotor in the engine all in the 6 years I ve owned the car  Not to mentioned the car has slid into two ditches and hit a curb hard which inturn it needed two front end alignments and a new rim  This is all the repair I have put into the vehicle and it is still going strong  I predict this car could go 180 000  with proper maintenance and I only paid  9000 dollars for it  What a deal  As I now see it anyone who wants an affordable  reliable  and fun car should get this one  But if you are looking for performance and style steer clear  this is not the car for you FYI  the Ford Aspire is actually a Kia Avella  The car model was purchased and marketed in the states by Ford before Kia made its move in the American market  The car was 80  Kia and 20  Ford  If you are looking for a car similar to the Ford Aspire in todays market check out the Kia Sephia the body style and features are different but under the hood is pretty much the same     
Pos, My wife was looking for an SUV a couple of years ago and I talked her into a mini van  We picked out a 95 Windstar because it had everything we wanted  V6 engine to pull a camper  seats seven  extra cargo space and a reasonable price used  Our Van had 34 000 miles when we purchased it  We now have 74 000 miles and had a number of minor and major problems  Luckily we purchased an extended warranty and have not had to fork out too much cash The computer had to be replaced at about 52 000 miles  covered under extended warranty The head gasket had to be replaced at about 56 000 miles  covered by Ford due to a faulty gasket problem The front tie rod had to be replaced at 68 000 miles  covered under extended warranty The engine had to be replaced at 73 000 miles  covered by Ford for the same problem as the head gasket  A note to all Windstar owners  Ford will replace your engine up to 100 000 miles or reimburse you if you already had your head gasket replaced or your engine replaced After comparing problems with a friend of mine  I was alerted to a transmission problem and a break problem with the 95 Windstars  I have not had any problems with the brakes or transmission  but if I do  I hope they come before my extended warranty expires Got it back from shop with the new engine and now the transmission fluid is leaking  I finally got it back to the Ford Dealer and he said it was the seal at the torque converter  Another  50 on my extended warranty Other then these mechanical problems  we do like our Windstar  It s roomy  comfortable  easy to drive  We pull a pop up trailer with it  but you cannot find air shocks for the Windstar  so all you can really get is heavy duty shocks to pull a trailer  The v6 3 8L does fine pulling the trailer  but eats a lot of gas  The Windstar has the cargo capacity of an extended Dodge Caravan  This helps on grocery day or for trips I would not recommend an older model Windstar  but I would hope the newer models have all the bugs worked out  For all you older model owners  cross your fingers and save your pennies  repairs could be in your future David Since writing this opinion I had a sensor for the EGR valve go bad which cost  134 to fix and It was covered on my extended warranty So far I have had  1800 worth of work done using my extended warranty  The  900 I paid for the warranty was money well spent  That doesn t even include the head gasket and engine rebuild that Ford paid to fix br br  
Pos, We own a 95 Windstar  With the rising prices of mini vans a used one is a good option for many people and 95 Windstars are easy to find and reasonably priced for a family We bought our s in Nov 1997 and it had 30 000 miles on it  We bought it because of it s safety rating  safest mini van made  and it s roominess In the last 2 1 2 years I have learned a lot about this vehicle  I ve driven it in snow  wind  rain  long trips etc Good points  Roomy one of the largest mini vans made  Plenty of leg room in the first and second row  An adult can stand  bent over  next to the seats and maneuver children and items fairly easily Fast  The Windstar has great pick up  which is vital when getting on busy highways  It has a 3 8L engine which makes all the difference in the world Mileage  As minivans go  it isn t bad  I can get about 380 400 miles on one tank  21 gallons Visibility  You can see everything around you very well  No terrible blindspots  at least for me Handling  Drives like a car  not a large van Bad points Buggy transmission  The transmission is sensitive  If you don t have it lined up JUST RIGHT you will not really be in park  drive  reverse etc  You must always use your emergency brake on the slightest incline Heavy second and third seats  The second and third seats are removable but not on wheels  The second seat can be removed by one person without much trouble but the third seat really takes two  It is not impossible  just a pain Overall  I really like the vehicle and would buy another and recommend it  The pros outweigh the cons  I happily put up with the heavier seats and lack of drivers side sliding door for the extra room br br  
Pos, My 95 Ford Windstar at 90 000 miles has settled into a comfortable middle age  but it went through a lot of grief to get this far  An automatic transmission rebuild and head gasket replacement are the two major repair items so far  Anyone looking to buy a used 95 check to see if the head gasket on the 3 8 liter engine has been replaced  If not  keep on looking The Windstar is a quiet  comfortable vehicle with a good view of the road  The long wheelbase helps provide an absorbent ride  The Windstar is adequately powered at best  Gas mileage on our van has averaged 18 20 mpg  The cabin is comfortable up front  a bit claustrophobic in the rear  Didn t get the rear captain s chairs  but after riding a few hours in back recently  I wish we had  The rear seats are difficult to remove for hauling  but once they re out  you have a huge space for cargo  The rear seatbacks fold flat in an instant  an option I use a lot to haul my bike in the back  The Windstar meets our needs as a family of five very well  Now that it s paid for  we plan to run it into the ground br br  
Pos, We bought a 95 Windstar about 4 months after they came out in April of 94  We had owned two Aerostars previously  I loved driving it  We made alot trips in it and it never left me on the side of road  We had our first problem with the sliding door  The sensors would go off and the chimes would start  Took it back several times but could not find a problem with it  They even tried adjusting the door We finally figured out the problem  if you get the contacts wet or they are dirty even just a little then that will set the chimes off and turn the interior lights on  WE didn t have any more problems until a trip to Phoenix and the check engine light came on  Took it in and is was an oxogen sensor  Had to have the brakes done at 30000 miles IT took four times to get it right  I blame that on the dealer  We had finally payed it off this past September and thought we would be without a car payment for a couple of years  Wrong In December with 69 000 miles on it the transmission was acting up  It would not shift into first gear after stopping  Xmas was not the time to give me problems with an upcoming trip home for the holidays  We decided to trade it in and buy a bigger vehicle  For the most part it was a good van it served its purpose while we had it  IT was getting small for since we have teenage boys and they are all over 6 feet tall  I liked the ride better than the Caravan  The seats were alot more comfy  I would recommend this van to families  Overall it really never let us down until the end br br  
Pos, I have a 1995 Ford Windstar and I think it is the best around  I have three kids  ages 3  2 and newborn  It is so easy to get them in and out through the side door  I never have to worry about leaving my oldest on one side of the car unattended  Plus  the van is roomy enough that I can strap them all in easily  Then I just turn around and hop in the driver s seat  There is plenty of legroom  THe most I have seen in a minivan  Even being very pregnant  I can drive the Windstar comfortably  There is lots of cargo space  We have a large wagon and we just plop in in the back for day trips  Also we are campers and there is plenty of space for our tent  action packers and cots  Even all the extras we need for baby like a pack and play  I highly reccommend the Windstar  It is the best purchase we could have made     br br  
Pos, IF YOU HAVE KIDS AND NEED A VEHICLE A 5 year owner and I don t like FORDS  but I do like this one  I own a 1995 Ford Windstar and love it  I have had it long enough to know whether I d buy another or not  What really matters when owning a van in addition to reliability  How the vehicle holds up to a family  We are a young family of 5 and our 2 youngest  4  amp  5  have grown up with this being our only vehicle We have never had any major problems with the van and people still are amazed to find out that the Van is nearly 5 years old and still looks new  What I am getting at is that we have not done anything above normal maintenance and cleaning  maybe even a little less than the average person  and the van still looks good inside and out  The fabric does not show wear or stains  the carpet has maintained its look as well  The gas mileage  3 8 ltr engine  is a little less than I would like  about 23 highway and 15 city  The only things we ve had to replace or fix in five years is a power window motor and one a c relay switch   
Pos, I have owned a lot of different vehicles over the years for various purposes including four different pickups  My most recent purchase was the Ford Power Stroke Diesel  Model year 1997  It is a F 250 XLT model Supercab with and automatic and 4 wheel drive  I have owned it for a year and the following sums up my experience with the vehicle MECHANICAL ATTRIBUTES  rating 8 out of 10  The Power Stroke has proven to be a real reliable engine with lots of low end torque while at the same time providing a fair amount of top end cruising ability  I pull a 35 foot fifth wheel trailer and have been able to climb a 4 to 5  grade and still maintain 50 miles per hour with the trailer attached  The fuel mileage is good for a working rig with a big mill 17 mpg w o the trailer on  12 w  the trailer  The trucks digs right in from a dead stop and accelerates well  even with the trailer on There two things to be wary of when considering this vehicle  One is that the transmission  I have the three speed automatic with overdrive  is weak  It can not stand to be overheated much at all and so it needs to have an auxiliary transmission cooler for any significant pulling  the mechanics I go to have recommended to me that it should have at least a  quot 3 loop quot  cooler  These same mechanics have also recommended to me that the transmission be regularly serviced at least as often as the manual recommends  and more often for any significant pulling The other thing to remember to consider is that being a Diesel  regular oil changes are a must  Changing the oil and filters are spendy considering it has a two quart filter and a fifteen quart oil capacity  However this is a minor cost considering that with regular maintenance  some of the diesel trucks have gone 500 000 miles with out a major repair BODY AND COMFORT AMENITIES  rating 7 out of 10  The engineers did a good job of putting together a nice cab  seats  etc  on this particular model  amp  year  The driver s seat with lumbar and 6 way motorized adjustment gives me an ability to move the seat into almost any position I want  My brother has the same model  amp  year pickup and hates the feel he gets out of his seat  he says he always ends up with a back ache out of it  so I have run into mixed opinions on this feature The gauges are in full view and well lit  The temp  gauge often sticks in the normal operating position during an overnight cool down  my brother s does the same thing  The stereo works well with front and rear factory speakers and provides a good balanced sound  My only complaint here is that the clock literally gains a minute each day  which I don t think should happen with a fully electronic unit  The Air Conditioner works very well as does the heater  both are musts in my book The front passenger s seat tilts forward and rolls full forward all with one release lever  which allows extremely easy access to the rear seat  Speaking of the rear seat  I have found it very stiff and uncomfortable  although my kids and other passengers have not complained  I used to have a  96 GMC 3 4 ton Sierra extended cab  and I found the rear seat in it to be much more comfortable  however SUSPENSION AND RIDE  rating 9 out of 10  This is a truck and it rides as such and so I don t expect anything different out of it  For the most part you do feel the bumps in the road but it is smooth and comfortable and so not unpleasant of a ride  The truck also exhibits a wide turning radius which again you get used to  but it would be nice to be able to turn in a narrower radius in parking lots and on back country roads OVERALL  rating 8 out of 10  I really enjoy the truck  It pulls nice and I feel that I could do almost anything I wanted to do with it  it has the power that I need  yet provides the comfort  space  and other amenities that I desire in a vehicle  especially for long trips with the RV attached     
Pos, I purchased my 1995 Ford Explorer  Eddie Bauer Edition new  it was a dealer demo  in 1995 after shopping and comparing nearly every competing SUV The Explorer was the most comfortable of all comparable SUV s at that time  and five years later has lost very little of its comfort for driver or passengers  The notable comfort deterioration that has occurred is in various electrical system failures  Neither the dealer nor Ford has taken an acceptable level of responsibility for repairing electrical defects  Although the sound system has been repaired 5 times at no cost  other failures such as heat AC fan speed adjustability and wiper timing adjustability were not warranted The Explorer has provided 100  reliable transportation  having never required any functional service other than for normal maintenance  It handles like a smaller car in many ways  including cornering  It does burn a lot of gas  averaging about 14 miles per gallon with a mix of city and highway driving The Explorer is not designed for hauling large loads  but can fit a surprising amount of bulk if necessary  It is well suited for family trips Overall this was an expensive car to purchase  is expensive to fuel  and at a nuisance level has been expensive to keep functioning electrically  It has served its purpose quite well for me  My primary consideration was comfort for driver and all passengers  with transportation reliability being a high priority as well br br  
Pos, Hi I was out in the market and I came accros with the idea of purchasing a SUV  I found none that would fit my pocket  So I had to go to an auction to get me one  This baby came along  Eddie Bauer  loaded  4X4  control track  Man  my first SUV and I had a winner  HEre s my opinion b i Exterior   On the outside this truck is a winner  Its tall  heavy and has a sporty look  The side moldings and trim add a lot of personality to it  Big all aroung glass allows you to see all over the place  Keyless entry and alarma integrated  Roof rack and a hitch ball come to make everything more appealing  Wheels and Tires  225 75 16 and beautiful 16  3 spoke chome wheels b i Engine   It has the 4 0 CID engine  Mine was 6 cylinder but there s a 8 cylinder model too  The millage on this baby was kinda high  170K miles but if you could only hear her  its like the day it rolled off the assy ine  The previous owner did a terrific job taking care of it b i Interior   Leather baby  all leather all over  front and rear seats  central and side arm rests  The instrument cluster seems somewhat not so luxury but it gets the job done  To small glove box for my taste tho  Seats are the bomb  confortable  soft and lumbar support  This is for both front seats  On the back  there s space for that trip or the groceries  A convenient jack storage space and 4 frame bolted hooks so you can strap that baby seat or a flat tire b i Extras   6 CD changer and premium sound kicks it  subwoofer integrated  Automatic antenna  Rear wiper and squirter  Premium carpet job  Rear seat radio and AC controls  Automatic climate control  Power windows and locks  Cargo Cover  off ebay  4 x 4 BABY  ALL THE WAY b i Inconveniences  so far   AC unit on all explorers had a failure called blend door actuator  Mine has it  It wont let you mix the temp for the air  its either all cold or all hot Change the shocks for a model that allows you a softer ride  Otherwise you will get yourself a  kidney milkshake Only Motorcraft plugs are recommended for Ford engines I hope this review has helped you and please rate it  
Pos, Purchased a new 1997 E 150 conversion van  One of the best vehicles we ve ever owned  The captains  chairs are very comfortable and can be adjusted to just about any position one could want  The rear bench folds down into a bed that s both comfortable and easy to operate  We had a Rear A C installed   not a separate compressor but a separate coil and blower  Works extremely well   best  75 we ve ever spent  Opted for the 6 cylinder   like the mileage we get  up to 22 hwy miles  and it holds highway cruising speed quite well  On other than level roads though  the transmission shifts frequently when the cruise control is on and the speed is over 65  But on level roads  it works just fine  The separate reading lights allow the kids to read or play games at night without distracting the driver  The noise level is very low  We had the cold weather package added  even though we bought it in El Paso  TX  The extra insulation sprayed on the bottom insulates the sound too  Have never used the plug in block heater  The van now has about 50 000 miles on it  The only repairs have been a new starter  160  and a front brake job  400  Both were done by a Ford dealer so I m sure better prices could be had elsewhere  Oh  and we just replaced the tires  Not bad for a vehicle that s driven across the US three times and made innumerable  quot road trips quot  with a family of 5  all the boys have their own seat  no one touches anyone else  The van is extremely roomy and cost less than any of the minivans we looked at  All in all  a superior value for the money br br  
Pos, The Bronco II is an awesome vehicle  It can out maneuver any 4WD out there  except maybe the classic Bronco  has good power  it s comfortable  strong axles and manual transmission  5spd is the only way to go  rides great  etc  I can t say enough good things about my 1990 Bronco II XLT  I ve had it almost 2 years and enjoyed every bit of it  This thing is awesome  It s very versatile and rugged and you can do just about anything with it  check out bronco2 com and jamesduff com  I get great gas mileage for an older vehicle  It also has a pretty hefty 23 gallon gas tank  Most vehicles this size have no bigger than a 19 gal tank  The only major problems I ve had are one s I ve caused  I crushed the muffler 4 wheeling  punctured the gas tank 4 wheeling  and then the leaf spring sag and minor things to be expected with age  The leaf springs on Bronco IIs tend to wear out after a while causing rear end sag  but just a little  Nothing a leaf spring helper won t fix  I ve also seen 4 Runners with the same problem  Leaf springs are relatively inexpensive anyway  probably  150 180 for a full set  unless you get lifted springs  The B2 has outlasted my brother s  94 Jeep and his Saab 900  Ford makes great vehicles  It s got 194 000 miles and my bronco s still running strong  It s a pity that they quit making the B2 in 1990  I wish they still made  em  I love my Bronco II  
Pos, I just recently bought a ford escort because of the style of the car  This is a new type of car for my family  I think the car it s self is roomy and smooth riding  This ford escort is really good on gas  I recently took the car on a short road trip  You don t hear much road noise  Any one who is looking for a good dependable car should look into getting one except those with to small kids wish are in car seats  The only problem I had with it so far is that the radio volume will get louder then it wll go real low br br  
Pos, 95  of my Escort experience has been extremely positive  I own a red 1990 Ford Escort LX  four door hatchback  to be precise  We only paid  200 because my dad knew the guy he bought it from  my Escort is easily worth  700 800  I love my Escort  with these gas prices  a car that gets 30 to 33 miles per gallon is always good  and you can take them anywhere  interstate  city  dirt roads  etc  I take my escort up over the mountain and down a dirt road a couple times each week when I go to work the gelding I m showing in 4 H this year  and it does fine  It fights a little going up hill  but any four banger is going to do that  The biggest problem I have with my Escort is that it doesn t always start  this doesn t happen as often to me as it does to my cousin  who has 1989 Ford Escort LX  but my uncle and grandfather devised a way to start them with a screwdriver  I d have to get all technical about under the hood stuff that I don t know a whole lot about  and all s good there All in all  a great little car  It gets you where you need to go  And this car has so much character  You will not find a car with more character than an Escort  I promise you that  
Pos, My present car passed away one night on the way to work and my wife and I needed a another car van to replace it  I was always interested in the Aerostar as our friends have them  With 11 year old triplets we needed a van to hold all of us  The seven passenger van was just the ticket for us  We purchased a 91 used in March 2000 and so far no major problems save for having to replace the sliding door track at a cost of  200 00 including labour  My wife and I love the fan The 7 passenger seating is great  it allows us to separate the girls so they won quot t fight on long trips  We highly recommend this van  Anyone with a large family would benefit from this van p s  this van has 230 000 kilometers on it and it still purrs like a kitten has the pickup of a new van br br  
Pos, I purchased my Ranger new in March of 1996  I purchased it because I needed a truck to use while remodeling a home  but I wanted a vehicle that would be small enough to commute to work  I picked the Ranger over the other small trucks out there for a couple of reasons  First and foremost  the Ranger was rated at or near the top in most of the ratings categories in Consumer Reports  Second  in its price range  I felt that the Ranger offered more in terms of styling and options  The XLT package with sport wheels dress it up nicely  I have been more than pleased with my Ranger  It has 65 000 miles on it now and I haven t had a single repair  The 2 3 liter engine with the five speed manual transmission is sporty and fun to drive  I was originally worried that it would be under powered  but for light hauling and in most driving conditions the engine is more than adequate  The truck rides very well  smoother than small trucks I ve driven in the past  There are  however  some sacrifices made when purchasing a light truck  The room in the cab is tight and unless you have a camper shell  shopping can be a problem  My only regret is that did not invest in the extended cab model  Overall  I give my Ranger an excellent rating  I would highly recommend a Ranger to anyone considering the purchase of a small pick up     
Pos, I was in the market for a small truck  I looked around and I found that the ranger offered the most for your money  although I later found that the resale on these trucks drop very quikly  For less then I could have bought a toyota standard cab with a 4 cylinder  I got a super cab ranger with a 4 0 V6  with a 5 speed trans and power mirrors  I have put 62 000 miles on it with no problems what so ever  the gas milage isn t the greatest  but it s worth it  the 4 0 has more than enough power  and tows my 19  ski boat with little effort  I was really impressed when I hooked up my boat to see how it tows  I drove it from L A to NewYork to Maine and back to L A with no trouble what so ever  I recently installed a vortech super charger with 5 pounds of boost and the truck just screams  very very reliable  If anyone has any advice  any problems with 4 0  or questions  please e mail me at cornfed621 aol net  I will gladly answer any questions reguarding the 4 0 ranger  any advice would be greatly appreciated   
Pos, My wife and I set out to try every convertible on the market  The range went from the tiny Toyota MR2 with absolutely no storage space   to the Chrysler Sebring convertible  We were ready to settle for the Chrysler when we spotted the Thunderbird in a Ford specialty showroom  We took it for a test drive and fell in love immediately  It was well above the price range we were shopping in  42k list  but in the end that didn t matter  We bought it two weeks later p The 2003 Thunderbird has two options that earlier models did not  280 horsepower and an auto manual shifter  Since the car weighs close to 4000 lbs  the additional horsepower was a welcome addition  It now runs 0 60 in a respectable 6 8 seconds  Keep in mind  this is not designed as a sports car  so acceleration in that range is admirable  The auto manual shifter is selected by pushing the shifter to the right  then selecting up or down a gear manually without using a clutch  We are still getting used to this feature  but I can say that it does improve acceleration p The overall look and feel of the Thunderbird can be summed up in one word   Style  The retro stylings take you back to the original Thunderbird in most every detail  Even the rag top has its original roots  Rather than take the car to a fully automatic top as was done in the Volvo C70  another Ford  they left a simple manual latch in the center of the top  with an automatic open close button easy to reach on the dash  When the weather gets nasty  our model came with the optional hard top  This top snaps easily into place  but be sure to have two strong adults to remove it  It weighs a solid 85 lbs and is fairly awkward  Fortunately it also came with a stand for garage storage of the top during the fair weather months p Inside the cabin you will find tastefully detailed leather seats  with wood and stainless appointments  Heated seats  dual climate control  6 disc CD changer  dash ignition key  steering wheel mounted radio controls  power mirrors  cup holders and cigarette lighter adapters round out the dash  Power seats make driver swaps a breeze p The real fun for this car is a good twisty road  Rear wheel drive combined with good weight distribution  and lots of it  make for a very fun drive  Brakes are extremely competent   especially given the weight of the vehicle  Testing panic stops left me very happy with the car s safety systems  With the top down  the noise level is acceptable  Raising the windows brings noise down to soft conversation levels  This includes both wind and engine noise  I can t believe how quiet the engine is while cruising  Put your foot in the floor and it will audibly remind you of the v8 heritage under the hood  Speaking of the windows   each time you open the doors  the window automatically drops a quarter inch to release from the rag top  The window automagically creates a tight seal when you close the door again  Inserting the key in the ignition prompts the power tilting steering wheel to return to its previous position in front of you  One turn of the key  and you wonder why you didn t just sleep in that comfortable driver s seat  Unfortunately the trunk only has space for a couple of small suitcases or a large garment bag  This would not be a good car to take on a two week tour of the country p Gas mileage has been fairly consistent  running 18 city and 23 highway  We only have 1500 miles on the car so far   the engine won t really be broken in until 3500 miles or so I have to give Ford credit for building a high quality product with little competition  This car is a definite head turner  be it a weekend driver or a daily commuter  
Pos, I just turned over 30 000 miles on my 1998 Ford Ranger  four door XLT  4x4  This is my third over the past fourteen years  This is the first that ever had a glitch  The  door ajar  light stays light and occasionally the dome light stays on by itself  The dome light is always on for the first few tire revolutions  I haven t counted the actual number but about twenty feet worth The rear transaxel  clanks  once for each of the first two gears when accelerating from a stop Of course the original tires were Firestone Recall brand  I was lucky enough to have my blow out just before the story hit the media  I paid six hundred plus for a set of Big O tires at less than twenty thousand miles  At this time there is no known recourse for people like me who only got hurt in the wallet when their Firestone s fell apart For the most part I love my truck  It s got personality and a past   Like most of my friends br br  
Pos, This cobra is the second of this particular breed that I ve owned  the first being a 2001 Cobra Convertible  My initial reaction when I saw the reveal of this car is wow  The statistics alone are mind boggling  for any car  390 Horsepower  underrated by Ford intentionally  realistic figures are somewhere around 381 at the rear wheels and 415 25 at the flywheel  390 foot pounds of torque  0 60 in 4 5 seconds  1 4 mile time between 12 5 and 12 9  all OUT OF THE BOX  Finally  an auto maker took the drawing board out of the engineering room in the basement and took it out the enthusiasts that are actually buying and driving the car and said  OK guys  what should we do next  From the beginning  you go in knowing that you re getting a frighteningly fast car  but the deal just keeps getting better  As you sit down inside the car  you noticed the snake badged two tone leather suede seats  the electroluminescent instrument cluster  Mach 460 6 disc in dash CD player  and the coveted 6 speed Tremec T 56 6 speed manual transmission  shared by the Cobra s arch nemesis the Dodge Viper  The front seats are VERY comfortable for a sports coupe  strongly bolstered  yet still supportive and soft  The driver s seat is power  with adjustments to the height  angle  pitch  side bolster  rear end bolster  lumbar support  etc  The backseat is small  as is to be expected in this breed of car  most cars that can compete from a performance standpoint don 146t even HAVE a backseat  so my theory is be glad I have one at all  Popping the hood of the vehicle reveals a beautifully trimmed 32 valve Dual OverHead Cam 4 6 litre  281 ci  American V8  A small metal plate will grab the eye of anyone looking at an SVT engine for the first time  as each engine is hand signed  engraved  by the two man team that built them  Mounted proudly atop the large American V8 is an Eaton Roots type supercharger  capable of 8 pounds of boost from the factory  The engine has been modified from its aluminum block cousin that was in the 1999 and 2001 cobra  The new engine block is cast iron  to increase strength for the added stress created by the supercharger  The compression ratio has also been reduced  again  to accommodate the forced induction  After the typical male rush of testosterone  not a sexist comment  have seen plenty of ladies sporting Cobras as well as gentlemen  I closed the hood and took a tour around the outside of the car to gauge it s styling  The hood has been modified from the previous hood  both to add room for the blower  and  with the addition of  finally  functional hood vents  to vent hot air from the engine compartment  The front fascia has been modified  with more open areas to allow cool air to pass into the engine compartment to facilitate better engine cooling and venting of the massive front disc brakes  Along side the vehicle  Ford has changed the rocker panel trim slightly  and the side scoops  unfortunately not functional  have been modified from the 1999 2001 run  The rear of the  03 is very different  with a much cleaner look than its predecessors  and it s own siblings in the Mustang corral  The spoiler is now more integrated into the body  reminiscent of the spoilers on the BMW M series cars  The tunnel like large tail pipes make themselves very visible  as does the Badging naming this Mustang the head of the SVT pack  Minor tweaks such as spoilers on the windshield wipers  making them functional up to a frightening 130 miles per hour  body color keyed break away mirrors  and the restyled fascia set this snake apart from the others in the SVT cobra den  Now that I had investigated all that I could about the car with it motionless  it was time to wake the beast up for a little stretching of the legs  Immediately upon ignition  the car makes its intentions known with that typical American V8 burble  turning every head within 300 feet  After playing with the shifter  I decided it was time to set out on this little adventure  As I pulled out into the highway  I noticed how mild mannered this  supercar  seemed to be as I drove it into afternoon traffic  This car could very easily be slated into a comparison with Clark Kent   Superman  With a light foot on the throttle  its not jerky or hard to control in the least  It was when I decided to put my foot into the floorboard that the car underwent a metamorphosis  The  Boost  needle went full tilt to 8 PSI  the tachometer started its screaming climb to 6500 RPMs  and I was firmly planted  goofy grin and all  to the back of my seat  WOW  As I shifted into second at about 6000 RPMs  the whole cataclysmic process repeated itself  Approaching 6300 RPMs this time  I noticed OH MY GOD  I am in second gear  going 73 miles an hour  in just a bit shy of 6 seconds  Deciding that I wanted to keep my privilege to drive   I was in a 55 zone  I backed off the accelerator and shifted into third  giving my internal organs a moment to catch up to my body  I got on the interstate and repeated the jet like acceleration  up to about 100MPH and back down  Ok  now I don t just THINK the car is fast  I KNOW it is  Lateral acceleration  however  is just one part of the equation that makes a great sports car  What goes up must come down  Once I made sure I was in the clear with cars around me  a firm stomp on the brakes brought the massive 13 inch front Brembo rotors to life and as expected  in true Cobra fashion  the car stopped on a dime and handed over 9 and 1 2 cents change  Ok  that 146s two parts of the equation passed with flying colors  it can accelerate like a tomahawk missile and stop like it had reverse thrusters but can it handle anything less inviting than Interstate 75  I took the car to the road that my house is off of  in rural Paulding County  Georgia  The road is a blast for a driving enthusiast  two 90 degree curves  and soft slopes that turn halfway down a hill  etc  I made one run at a normal pace just to get a feel for the car  The second run etched an image of the car driving around on tires lined with double sticky tape  This car is glued to the road  Pushing it near its limits will illicit a bit of a happy rear end in hard cornering  which is to be expected and is welcomed as long as the driver is as capable about handling it as the car is doing it  The handling is brilliant  with many welcome tweaks to the suspension in 2003  The body roll is very minimal  as the body feels more rigid than did my 2001  On the open highway  the ride is as nice as to be expected in a car with the handling capabilities of this vehicle  if you want a smooth ride  opt for the same base engine in the Mercury Marauder  this is  after all  a supercar  Wet traction is also above average  with help of the car s Goodyear Eagle F1 tires and the standard traction control  I do at times find it easier just to reach down into the endless pool of torque and start out lazily in second gear in heavy rain to eliminate any rear wheel slippage  The ABS system on the car is very advanced  and even in panic braking in wet conditions  the car comes to a very confident stop  I have yet to experience it in snowy weather  but I am hoping that this car will have to experience very little of it with me residing in Georgia  The steering is firm and responsive  as is the clutch shifting engagement  though the shifter can be a bit quirky at times  The clutch does take some getting used to  as one person that I let drive the car put it  you ll have the legs of a linebacker after driving this thing every day  All in all  one couldn 146t ask for a better balance of ride quality and handling ability in a better package  That basically sums up each of the individual parts that are required to make up a good sports car  Tallying all of the scores  the Cobra is simple an achievement on the part of the Ford Special Vehicles Team  The Cobra unfortunately lost its competition from GM this year  with their F body cars no longer being produced after 2003  Authors note  the 2003 Cobra is faster than any F body GM offered in 2002  snicker  The price on this car at its release was  34 750  though many dealers across the country are price gouging it  anywhere from 1000 dollars over sticker to 10 000 in areas where the car is hard to get  I absolutely refused to pay a dime over sticker  and finally found an honest dealership here in Atlanta that was selling the car for the same sticker it got onto their lot with  The price tag on this car is a true steal  considering the next rival to this car is the Corvette Z06  the two vehicles are truly not in the same class  but as the 2003 Cobra is faster and more powerful than the stock C5 Corvette  the Z06 is its most loved comparison in the GM Ford war that 146s been raging since the 60 s  The base price tag on the Z06 is in the neighborhood of  51 000  For comparison s sake  a 1300 dollar investment into modifications will put the Cobra to a performance level of 500  Rear Wheel Horsepower  not that this author would every encourage the modification of such a beautiful automobile  Calling the 2003 Ford SVT Mustang Cobra anything less than a supercar would be underselling it dramatically  The 2003 holds the title of being the most powerful  5 more advertised horsepower than the 2000 Cobra R  Mustang to roll out of the Ford plant  and it carries the honor with flying colors  The Mustang platform is going to be retired for the 2005 model year in favor of a modified version of the Jaguar X type and Lincoln LS platform  code named DEW lite  One can only wait in stitches to see what kind of work of art the guys at Ford s Special Vehicles Team will produce on that platform  
Pos, i am sixteen years old and i have recently purchased a ford probe  i have owned this vehicle for about six months and i love it  i don t really have the cash to be buying new parts and having to fix things so this car is ideal for me  i haven t made one stop at the shop yet  I like the way that all your controls are right there  especially the turn signal  which you can easily turn on with a flick of the pinky  the back seat may be my only complaint  but being in my young years still it doesn t really come into play  the probe is quick   sporty  fairly cheap and very fun to drive     
Pos, I bought my 1995 4 door hatchback Aspire used from my neighbor  It had 70 000 miles on it and I paid  2 000 for it  I just love this little car  My boyfriend is tall and was very surprised about how much leg room he has in it  I get excellent gas mileage  40 mpg  Its air conditioner has a hard time while driving in town and sitting in traffic  but works fine when on the open road  It will go fast speeds  85  if you are in a hurry  but does tend to start vibrating at 70  Excellent for shopping trips  fits well into tight parking places  and has plenty of cargo space  I drive this more than my new 4 wheel drive Ford Ranger  I really enjoy owning this little car  
Pos, I own a 1995 Ford Aspire base model 2 door hatchback with air  cassette  and the standard transmission  I purchased it recently for a very low price because it had been previously wrecked  This car is however in excellent condition for a 5 year old mini with 75 000 miles I ll be honest  most people would probably hate this as a used car  It has several  quot where the heck is that coming from quot  rattles  buzzes  and clunks  It used to vibrate at higher speeds because the tires were a cheap off brand  Michelin Weatherhandlers fixed that problem  This particular Aspire  having been previously wrecked  probably will not last much longer  but for right now it is doing me just fine as a courier delivery vehicle  There is plenty of room for cargo and the rear seat not only folds down but flips up against the front seats to provide a flat cargo floor  It is fully carpeted  too This car always starts right up and runs smoothly  does not smoke or knock  and has enough power for me  Some people might say this car is underpowered  For these folks  do not worry  Most 1 6 and 1 8 liter Mazda engines will bolt in with little modification  as will the better geared Mazda transmissions  I have been averaging an honest 35 mpg with this car under hard driving in Dallas  Texas with the AC running about 75  of the time  Having no power steering is only a chore during parallel parking  which I have to do little of because most of my deliveries go to businesses I have learned that keeping the tires inflated properly will keep the steering light above a crawling speed  The brake rotors are warped now  I am sure turning them will help at least for a little while  The only major problem I foresee with this car is the clutch  it is slipping slightly when I drive harder  but if I take it easy  it shifts and engages fine  The shifter is rubbery  but if you are gentle with it  it will slip right into and out of gear  The rougher you treat it  the tougher it is to get it to shift  I would say this car is not the best for long trips  I have a Buick Century for those  But to do the basic point A to B to C to D of courier work  this car is okay  I used to own a Geo Metro and this car is a welcome change  not necessarily better  but it is different br br  
Pos, In June of 1998  a 1996 Ford F 150 XL was given to our family as a company vehicle  It was grey green two tone  with grey cloth interior and automatic transmission Inside the truck is a well designed and easy to use dash  Most knobs and dials are easy to find  and fit well in your hands  Most materials of are very high quality  However  the radio controls are awful  the buttons are too close together  and you have to take your eyes off the road just to turn it on  However  the radio and cassette player put out amazing sound quality  The speakers work well  and surround the whole truck cab with your choice of music  The bench seat does not give enough back support  You get a  quot sinking quot  feeling when you sit down  The air conditioner keeps you ice cold in the hottest weather  and in the dead of winter  the cab is red hot in only a matter of minutes  Outside  the whole truck looks great  The paint is average  but there are swirl marks all over after washing  and the alloy wheels  where equipped  corrode quickly  so one must keep them clean  The chrome wheels and bumpers  along with the two tone paint  really accent the exterior  The box is huge and can handle most loads  but the tailgate is too high and rather heavy  Loading the box requires 2 people The ride is bone jarring  You feel almost every vibration the road can throw at you  There is little wind and road noise  though  The V6 engine provides ample power and torque  but you get the feeling you re driving a family sedan instead of a pickup  The 4 speed automatic  with overdrive  transmission robs the engine of much needed power and shifts roughly  However  it handles curves responsively and with confidence  and parking is not a problem  You could steer this truck with your index finger  Surprisingly  this truck is a blast to drive  You can throw the F 150 any curve  and it inspires confidence every time Reliability is not a problem  The only problems I ve had with it so far is a broken driver s door lock  a cassette stuck in the cassette player  and a minor transmission repair  If you are looking for a truck to do basic hauling  moving  or just to run back and forth to the store  then the F 150 is the truck for you  It s tough  reliable  and fun to drive  It s a combination truck family sedan  and it s one great buy     
Pos, Bought truck brand new September 1996  XL Shortbed 4 9 engine 5 speed with 3 55 rear end  has 100 000 miles  I bought this truck for use in my landscape buisness  it has never been driven without a trailer in tow  usually about 3 000 lbs  Still has original clutch   amazing  has only gone through one set of front brake pads  I had a problem with a leaky smog tube which was misdiagnosed and ended up costing over  1200  and have replaced both fuel pumps and had the fuel system cleaned out at a cost of  1400  however this may have been caused by running the tanks low to avoid gas stops  I live in the Arizona desert and the truck is parked outside so I am very impressed that the finish still looks like new  as does the interior  this vehicle is very sun resistant  The engine runs flawlessly in stop and go driving with heavy loads in the Arizona heat of 100 110 degrees  and is pleasant to drive  I must say I am very pleased with this vehicle  it has made me a ton of money and still looks and runs like new  
Pos,  Why Ford Focus b Of the choices available to us through our leasing program  the Ford Focus was simply the cheapest model with the required safety features  twin airbags  anti lock braking system  We have been driving a leased 2003 Ford Focus auto sedan for about 6 months now in Australia b Driving Experience  We have certainly enjoyed the improvement in our driving experience as compared with our previous 7 year old small car  Daewoo Cielo  Much quieter  smoother  more powerful  We found ourselves more relaxed after longer drives  From that perspective we are very happy with this car b Features and Options  Some of the features are annoying  particularly that the indicator controls are on the  wrong  side of the steering wheel  Also  the indicator noise is incredibly loud   its unbelievable that the designers included such an annoying noise in their design  The stereo controls on the steering wheel are so close to the actual stereo controls its of no benefit to have a second set  In fact the track radio station control on the steering wheel is not intuitive and I have to work it out every time I use it  I ve stopped using it now  A common problem with the Ford Focus is that the fuel gauge fails during the first two months   this happened on our car and on several others that we know of  A further issue is that the cigarette lighter does not seem compatible with our phone charger   the same charger works in a number of other cars that we have used  Finally  the air intake defaults to  open  every time that the car starts  so closing it in traffic becomes a regular chore for us  So much for the negatives The features that we like are this car s comfort  handling and performance  Its got high headroom which is a big plus  The door lock and boot lock remote is something we love  Plenty of space in the boot The options that we got were  roof rack  we removed this immediately   the noise on the highway was shocking  scuff plates  yes we like them  passenger seat bag  too big  gets in the way  boot liner  excellent for cleaning up spills  and boot carrier net  saves the shopping from rolling around  
Pos,  Note  I have not driven the 2000 Cobra R  Many people have criticized me and given me NR ratings for lack of personal experience  I have ridden in this car  and since there are only 300 of these cars in production  I feel my personal experience will suffice  I have a vast knowledge of this vehicle due to research  This and my love for this car is why I am writing this epinion  If you feel I deserve an NR for not driving this car  then that I will accept it  Thanks  hope you enjoy the review b To say the least  the year 2000 was an interesting year for Ford s Special Vehicle Team  SVT  With delays on the production of the 2000 Mustang Cobra because power outputs were lower than listed  SVT produced a limited edition of the 2000 Cobra which was given the glamorous name  Cobra R The most powerful Mustang automobile ever produced  the Cobra R brings awesome power and mean looks to the road  Because of limited production of the vehicle  only 300 were made  the prices have boomed past  50 000  Some people think it is crazy to pay such outrageous money for a Ford while others are willing to pay the premium to own such a majestic vehicle b Performance  The Cobra R packs a 5 4 DOHC V8 engine  This huge piece of equipment forced the redesign of the hood of the car just to fit this bad boy in the front of the car  The large bulge in the hood gives evidence to the size of this mammoth power house  Intake and exhaust ports were redesigned by SVT to improve the air flow for the car  Despite the rather heavy weight of this car  the 385 horses under the hood make this car zoom 0 60 in about 4 7 seconds and 0 100 in about 10 9 seconds  Due to the powerful engine and amazing aerodynamics of the Cobra R  the top speed exceeds 170 MPH  Exhaust on the Cobra R is also been modified greatly  Because of rear suspension and fuel tank complications  rear exiting exhaust pipes had to be voided  The car has side exiting exhaust tips directly in front of the rear wheels  This automobile also comes with a new 6 speed manual transmission as opposed to the standard 5 speed which comes with most Cobra vehicles b Suspension  The suspension in the Cobra R is rock solid  This is good and also bad  For track use  which is basically what the Cobra R is intended for  the Cobra R handles exceptionally  however  for road use  the rock solid suspension creates a rough ride  The Cobra R has a lowered ride height and 18 inch wheels wrapped in 265 40ZR18 tires   Exterior  The Cobra R s most noticeable features on the exterior are definitely the front racing air dam and the rear spoiler  Both body pieces give the automobile a definitive look as well as the look of a mean racing machine  The 300 Cobra R s produced are all the trademark color of red  When I first saw one of these cars at a fairly large Ford dealership where I live  I was in awe  There is a majestic aura about this car that is difficult to explain  maybe it s the fact that only 300 of these vehicles exist or maybe it s the combination of beauty and power  Being a huge Mustang fan  I believe this car is stunningly beautiful  I actually got my friend who works at the dealership to take a couple pictures of me and the Cobra R b Personal Experience with the Cobra R  I have a friend who works at the SVT licensed Ford Dealership in my town  I convinced him to let me come in and ride with him in the Cobra R  he wouldn t let me drive it  Being a huge fan and having read every known article on the Cobra R  I took this opportunity without a second thought  When he started up the car  I was amazing at the ear pleasing sound which resonated from the exhaust pipes  I have always thought that Mustang s have great sounding engines  but all I can say about the Cobra R exhaust tone is  quot Wow quot  Although we only were in the car for a minute or two  it was amazing  When he hit the gas  I was awestruck with the power of the engine  I literally was pinned to my seat  The ride was slightly rough  but I could care less  The Cobra R is truly an All American sports car b Other notes about the Cobra R  Most people who know some information on this vehicle know that this car comes without an air conditioner and a radio  The car is strictly a racing vehicle  not for every day driving  Because of the rarity of this car  prices have gone over  70 000  the Cobra R I rode in went for  74 000  SVT Ford has created a legendary special edition of a classic car  The Cobra R is truly an amazing vehicle that I would love to even be able to see another one in person again  The Cobra R is a pure muscle car which is probably owned by people who have money to burn  One thing is for certain  if I had the money  I would definitely do what I could to get my hands on the 2000 SVT Cobra R br br  
Pos, We bought our first Explorer in 1996  I have to admit I was reluctant about driving a  quot truck quot  but was soon won over  It was almost as luxurious as any car I d owned and  boy  could I see better on the road  I really enjoyed it and it was very reliable After a couple of years we traded it for a 1998 Eddie Bauer version  Even more bells and whistles and again very reliable  At this point I knew I would never go back to a  quot car quot  again Recently  we bought the 2000 Limited edition  I absolutely love it  It has power everything  Probably more buttons than I ll ever be able to figure out  but I will have fun trying My favorite new feature are the memory seats  My husband is tall and I was constantly having to re adjust the seat when he would drive my previous Explorers  Now  we with just a click of the remote opener the seat is perfectly adjusted for me when I get in It has a very smooth ride and handles well  It also has beautiful  very comfortable leather seats  The sound system is great and has the optional 6 CD player  That is perfect for long trips The Explorer is just the right size for me and my husband and is comfortable for our occasional back seat passengers  It also holds lots of suitcases  golf clubs and or dive gear  when needed  It really is the best of both worlds   the comfort of a luxury car  the cargo capabilities of a truck  There s plenty of room in the back to haul groceries or even sustain a massive shopping spree   Trust me b Update added January 7 2001 b Having driven this Explorer for almost 8 000 miles and several months I am happy to report  knock on wood  that I have had absolutely no problems with it  I very much love this vehicle   My husband won t let me call it a car  I refuse to call it a truck  and SUV is so   well  you know This Limited Explorer rides very comfortably on the road and it is great for driving around town  It is averaging about 19 miles to a gallon of gas  I get rave reviews whenever anyone rides with me to lunch  as well  That s always a nice plus We ve hauled a lot of stuff in it  especially right before Christmas   We have grandkids  The rear seats fold down for carrying larger items such playhouses  and bicycles in the box I can also tell you we have hauled a new computer with 19 quot  monitor  big boxes and 8 foot step ladder at the same time  It was a bit interesting on the drive home  but we got it all in there  One friend laughs that my husband and I have single handedly kept the economy going by our weekend shopping sprees b Bonus  Bun Warmers b I ve also discovered during the unusually cold weather we ve had in Memphis  that the seat warmer is an absolutely wonderful option  Both the driver and passenger seat comes equipped with this option  It s easy to use  just depress the button on the side of the seat and in a few minutes the leather seats are comfortably warm  We ve had snow and ice a couple of times recently  very unusual for Memphis  and these seats have kept me toasty warm b Convenient Rear Controls  The rear heat and air controls have been very convenient for transporting passengers  It allows them to control the blower and keeps them comfortable  You can even let them hookup headphones in the rear  This would be great if I was hauling older kids in the back b Some of my favorite options b  Memory seats  only available on the Limited  This has been such a convenience  No more arguments with my husband  you moved my seat  Power seats  driver and passenger  You can move seats forward  backward  up  down  there s also the ability to tilt slightly forward or backward   The memory feature remembers how you like all these options  Power windows  standard on Limited and Eddie Bauer versions  Windows can be locked and unlocked by the driver  Dual controls on steering wheels   it s really nice to be able to adjust the temperature and fan  as well as control the volume of the radio or cd without moving your hands from the steering wheel  Power moon roof is nice on warm  sunny days  The console display gives me several options to view my gas consumption  gallons used  miles per gallon  and gas remaining  It also performs various system checks at my request  The CD player has great sound  There is a 5 disc changer in the console  as well as the ability to play a single disc in the slot in the dashboard  The speakers seem to be everywhere and you can easily adjust their performance to your taste  Remote Lock Security alarm  Two clicks on the remote lock assures me that all doors are shut and locked and the alarm is activated  There have been a couple of times a door didn t shut well and I was alerted to by using this feature I love this car and think it would probably be a great buy when it starts showing up in the used car market   if you ever find one  The owners may just hold onto this baby for a while  It s the perfect luxury car that just thinks it s a truck As a happy  3 time Explorer owner I highly the Explorer Limited 2000 br br  
Pos, I bought this 2000 Explorer XLT as a replacement for my 1997 GMC Jimmy  I wanted a new Explorer but my Jimmy was a piece of junk  see review on it  and I spent a lot of money and I had to buy what I could afford I purchased this Explorer at the local GMC dealership with 34 600 miles on it  I have put about 1 000 miles on it so far and I have had nothing but good service  When I purchased my Explorer  it had new General tires on it  I like the feature content such as rear air and radio  compass  CD player  and power equipment  I also like the rear wiper washer  the running boards  and the fog lights  The engine and the transmission are powerful and perform smoothly The gas mileage isn t great but it s an SUV and the mileage is just as good as that of my Jimmy was  I know some people say Explorers aren t stable even with tires other than Firestones but my Explorer seems very stable  
Pos, The E150 is a nice family van to go on long trips  It is also nice to drive around except for the fact that it is about the size of a semi  It gets bad gas mileage because our has a 5 8 liter engine but it has very good power for being as big as it is  It is also very comfortable in the front and back and for kids can be very enjoyable since their is tv and vcr plus any game consoles they want  The only thing I had a problem with was when I was getting off the freeway and I took the turn at 45 mph and the tire ripped off the axle causing it to break the running boards and me to do a 360 degree turn  If you live somewhere where it snows a lot this is not very good in the snow and I added a lot of weight in the back and it still wasn t  
Pos, I purchased my Probe SE  5 speed  used  in 1998 with 53 000 miles  Up until a few weeks ago  she was going strong at 198 790 miles  I drove her hard  fast  and rough  Only had to replace the O2 sensors  Airflow sensor  and tires Great ride  fun road tripping car  and handled very well in all kinds of weather Only drawback was the price on replacement parts  To replace an O2 sensor  retail price from the dealership was  300 each  and both need to be replaced when one goes out   pricy  600 for a set of sensors  Airflow sensor was  300 retail price from dealership as well  This did not include labor  so unless you want to put them in yourself  these are costly The design lacked in handling tire blowout  I had to retire my baby after she was totaled beginning of this month  I had Cooper Cobra tires on the car  when the front driver s side tire split  causing the entire front fender  front quarter panel  side panel  undercarriage panel  and door panel to become squashed as if I d run into a pole  requiring complete replacement if I d decided to pursue restoration  Also the electric wiring shaft was severed  causing the car to lose power while driving 70 mph on a curvy interstate  The entire car would ve had to be re wired  The cost for the panels start at  2000 a piece to replace with upper cost of the door panel to  2700   these are after market value prices  The damage was caused due to a poor design in handling tire split  Granted  sports cars are not meant to handle these situations beautifully  but having made minor design changes could ve prevented some of these damages Overall  I ve never had such a great car run so well with so many miles  I m sure she would ve kept going for another good 40 000 miles easy  All parts  excepting for the sensors mentioned above and the tires  were stock and still going strong I d recommend this vehicle for someone who performs regular maintenance on the Probe and loves to drive long distances  
Pos, Purchased from City of Seattle in an auction for  2000  I ve been the owner of my 1991 periwinkle blue Ford Escort LX for a little over a year now  Receiving this car when I had first received my drivers license  this car and I have been together through a lot Mainly driving the car to school and work  the interior is quite nice and comfortable for myself  although I wish the seats had more adjustment options because they can get to be quite stiff at times and aren t very back friendly for anything more than a daytrip  There isn t a lot of room in this car either  so I wouldn t reccomend it to a family of four or more  however  it s just fine for a short ride Driving this car has always been enjoyed  especially on day trips up to the ski resort  In the city this is the perfect car becuase it runs smooth and is easy to drive  Freeway driving on this car  however  isn t very fun  The car starts to get a little shaky anywhere after 60mph  although 60 is where the car is happiest to sit  and is  very  slow to accelerate  I must give it credit though for maintaining speed smoothly  The only problem I ve ever had with this car is the alternator  and don t go to a ford dealer to have this one fixed  and the pesky little  check coolant  light that mysteriously flashes on for a while randomly  and randomly shuts off  when the coolant is just fine  Gotta love Ford If the car does break down  however  be glad it s light  Because this car is really easy to push out of intersections  and very easy to tow with a tractor if need be  I know this from personal experience  and I was pretty glad  My favorite thing about this car is the spacious interior  not for hauling people  but things  The hatchback with the removable cover  and easy fold down backseat make it very easy to stick a lot in there  The feature of being able to fold down one seat alone or the entire back bench has been very nice in many situations as well  I drive up to Mt  Baker  Washington  quite often to snowboard  this car is  perfect  for an intensive hour long drive around fast corners  with three friends for passengers  and one seat folded down for the snowboards  The only shame is sometimes going around the corners you slide a bit when it s not expected  the car s ride can trick you sometimes into thinking the car can do things it really can t Cheap cars when it comes to purchasing  parts  and gas  They ride really well and are fun little cars to have  My car may be no Audi  but it s mine and I love it  The only thing I ve done to my car was buy it a new stereo  because ford factory radios aren t worth a thing  So if you would like a cheap car that will last you forever  is pretty dependable  and nice for commuting  this is a decent car for you  
Pos, This was my very first car   ever  And my husband could not have chosen a better car  We originally chose it because of the price  It was economical and good on gas and we were hoping to have a family at some time during the cars life  so we chose the wagon  Nine years  four kids and 125 000 miles later  the car is still taking care of us There have been very little problems with this car  The only recurring trouble that we have had to fix year after year is the air conditioning  They told us a few years ago that it was a broken O ring  they tried to give it a recharge of freon  but it still never worked properly  Other than the air conditioning  we never had any problems with the car  So considering the price and the mileage we have gotten out of it  I think that the Ford Escort Wagon was a fantastic deal br br  
Pos, I have a 1991 Ford Escort LX  I m 16 years old and this is my first car  I totally recommend this vehicle  Throughout the time I have had it  I haven t had any major problems  which is suprising considering the age of this car  It s reliable and gets good gas mileage  This is the perfect car for a teenager  For parents  it is a relief to know your child is protected and won t be broken down on the side of the road every other week  It s an automatic and easy to drive and handle  The only problem I have noticed is when the car reaches 65 miles per hour on the interstate  It becomes a little jumpy and the steering loosens slightly  But  my dad is basically a car expert and he believes this is nothing to worry about Buy this car   you will be happy you did br br  
Pos, I love Escorts  I think they re great I owned this European 1 6 S model for about 6 months and had a few problems The main problem in mine was the fuse box  Its a really common problem and was why the escort was considered unreliable I know enough about cars to change it myself  but it took a long time and a scrap box cost me  30  45  This may not be too much but if you got the Ford dealer to do it for you  it would cost  200   labour  You would be looking at over  400  600 Each escort model has a different fuse box  so finding the correct scrap one was hard The other problem with Escorts is the locks and alarm system  The barrels wear out very easily although if you know how to dismantle a door panel and remove the lock  the dealer only charges a small amount to change the barrels for you  The alarm is another problem  on other European Fords as well  If you lock the door from the passenger side and then unlock the door from the driver side  the alarm will go off  It is caused by a faulty electrical part on either the drivers or passenger side door locks  or both  It can be fixed but the parts will probably break again  Check this if you are buying one and use it to knock the price down Also check ALL electrics  Check the heater  inside fan  engine fan  and electric windows and anything else you can think of  I would not recommend buying a GHIA model or high spec model with a lot of electric parts  as there is to much room for error The main fuse blew on several occasions Other than this  i found the car nice to look at  nice do drive  and the handling was good as well  Seats were a little uncomfortable on long journeys though  Mechanically they are actually very good and the engine problems that occured were purely electricaly related Check the exhaust for rust on the back box though as they do not last very long The engine was the same model as the ones used previously in the 1984 91 model and so are not advanced and can be very noisy if worn  Listen to the tappets  If they are very noisy and the car claims to have done 30 000 miles  then it is more likely to be 130 000 The noises can start from 60 000 miles onwards depending on use  People try crafty methods such as using thick oil  or if the oil is not clean  then this will also dampen the noise  find out what oil was used Don t be put off by this  If the car is clean with a full history  and is quiet ish  then if the price is right  buy it  All electrical problems can be fixed very cheaply if you do it by yourself  You may never even experience any problems  but be aware of them and carry spare main and regular fuses at all time Conclusion Popular car and good value for money  Cheap spares availiable  never go to the dealers br br  
Pos, I owned a 91 Escort LX Wagon  passed down from parent  while first having gotten my license  This car had a 136 000 miles on it when i received it  and sold it to a friend with 139 000 miles  It keeps on asking for more punishment  because we were both teenage first time drivers  While I will admit that the interior materials are cheap  the stereo sucks  and there were no power windows or locks  I think that it was bought new for about 11 000 dollars  so what s to be expected  The engine was fairly punchy for being only 88hp  The car is light enough for it  The steering is a little sloppy  but not bad  I felt very secure in this car  and always trusted the reliability  It had rust under the back wheel wells  but I fixed it myself  The paint had begun to faid as well  it hadn t really been cared for before I got it  Either way I think that it is a safe bet  and a good  easy car for first time drivers to learn on  I drive a 95 Dodge Avenger now  and probably would hate to go back to the less refined Escort    read my gushing review of my Avenger  love that car   but I probably would get one real cheap if the Avenger was in an accident  But that Escort is an amazing car br br  
Pos, The Ford Excursion Limited 2002 An Oversize Status Statement  Looking at the Ford Excursion 2002 there is no doubt that it is a formidable machine  This oversize SUV is really beautiful whether you look at its exterior or its interior  Two words can describe the interior of the Ford Excursion Limited  ROOMY and LUXURY  Sitting behind the steering wheel of the Excursion you have the impression that you could park a second car inside  The Limited Edition comes equipped with leather seats  a 6 way captain style seat for the driver  and rich looking wood grain trims on the interior door panels and also on the front console  These features really give the Excursion s interior a fantastic appearance  As for the front cabin the rear of the excursion will again offers lots of room  The second row of seats can either be completely folded or folded in a 60 40 manner  The third row seats can also be folded and you will also have the option to remove it from the truck if you need to transport cargo  For the driver with the exception of the glove compartment  which is to far on the passenger  side  all other gauges and controls are easy to see and reach  The sound system  an AM FM  cassette  single CD stereo is superb and it is only surpassed by the quality of the sound it emits  The exterior body of the Excursion Limited is as attractive as the interior  The color of the Excursion I test drove was Deep Blue with beige body side moldings and this made for a super color combination with the tan leather interior  I really liked the tri panel rear door  it sure makes it easy to load cargo and equipment in the Excursion  The top part will open upward as for most other SUV but the lower portion of the rear will split open in the middle  The Excursion also comes equipped with a class IV load equalizing trailer hitch that will allow to safely pull a load of up to 11 000 pounds  Driving the Excursion on the highway is a great experience  but aside from driving it on the open road I do not believe it makes for great driving within city limit and for off roading  It is a very comfortable truck to drive and it is dead quiet  to me it is like a Lincoln on a truck frame  A friend of mine who owns a marina uses his Excursion to pull boats around  he told me that his old Suburban would do a much better job at pulling a loaded trailer than his new Excursion  The 2002 Excursion Limited I drove was equipped with a V 10 powerful engine  The transmission is a 4 speed automatic transmission  with a shift on the fly 4X4 system  The towing capacity is 11 000 pounds and the cargo space  with all seats folded and third row removed is 146 cubic feet  As you probably noticed after reading this review is that I really do have mixed feeling about the 2002 Ford Excursion Limited  It is a very beautiful truck  actually I think that it is too nice to be used as a working vehicle  But then it is also much too big to be used for city commuting  I guess this leave that it is an expensive SUV  TOY  for those who have it all  
Pos,  Purely Physical  Originally I fell in love with the looks of the truck  The side steps  the sliding rear window  the emerald green paint job  the plush front seats  the little cupholders  and of course the awesome stereo system  The Ranger has been a decent vehicle mechanically until this last year but I will get into that later  Besides the physical appeal  the truck is incredibly  economical  to drive  That is important especially with these gas prices  The only car that gave me better fuel economy was an old VW Bug  The bed of the truck is capable of hauling small lightweight loads  I like it because not that many people ask me to help them move since the capacity of the bed is limited If you are looking for a truck with a lot of power this is not the one  The 4 cylinder engine would not be my choice next time around  I hate when those big trucks pass me by on the onramps The Ranger provides a smooth comfortable ride under normal weather conditions  However  I have had several problems with slipping in the rain and snow even on the lightest of days  I weighted the truck down last winter with 25 lbs  of sand and still had trouble on snowy days   Bad News  In the last year I have had to have the switches in both doors replaced that control the overhead lighting system  It really is annoying to be driving down the highway with inside lights that won t go off  This was a freebie because the dealership said there was a recall I also had to have the accuator switch on the ignition replaced just recently  One day I just hopped in the truck and all my panel lights were on as well as the radio but there was no key in the ignition  When I went to turn the key  nothing  That little trip to the dealership was  267 00  Of course my warranty ran out about 3 months ago  Now the check engine light has decided to come on and continues to shine brightly even though I have had everything checked out  Who knows why b Overall Rating  Overall I would say that this really has been a good truck but I do plan on going with a larger version next time with more power  The Ranger is priced right with a lot of features for the buck but whether you like the truck or not is going to depend on your ability to deal with the downfalls  
Pos, I m 6 4 quot  and own a  97 Ranger XL Regular cab pickup  I give the truck a rating of 5 stars because it is perfect for someone who wants what my particular truck has to offer  That being said I would buy a truck with different options features and configuration if I had it to do over again  Keep the following things in mind when you go to buy a Ford Ranger  or any other small pick up b Color  My truck is gorgeous black with metallic gray trim and a gray interior  I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER BLACK TRUCK AGAIN  Ok I say that now  and when I see another black beauty in the showroom I ll probably buy one again  The problem is that there isn t a hotter looking color for a truck than black  It looks tough  it looks sophisticated  it looks like Marty McFly s 1986 Toyota pickup that he dreams will be in his garage when he comes Back to the Future  Heaven forbid that you use your truck like a truck though  Any little scratch shows  I had a heart attack the first day I took my truck to the car wash only to see it come out with swirls where the dryer s terry cloth towel had been  You can imagine my dismay every time I haul mulch around  or put bags of cement in the bed  When clear coat gets scratched on a black paint job it shows up white  Black also looks terrible when it gets salt on it from a the Northeastern roads  I would say your best bet for truck colors is 1  silver  2  tan  3  white  4  red b Cab Size  Regular cab trucks have no benefit in riding convenience over a Mazda Miata  As a matter of fact  you might be able to get more stuff out of the weather in a Miata  than in my regular cab Ranger  I bought a truck box just to solve the problem of no interior space  At least the box gives me a place to put 1 or 2 bags of groceries  Really though  if you plan on hauling kids  or even going on long trips  either buy an extended cab  or buy another vehicle  A regular cab Ranger is only useful for around the town hauling  and possibly longer trips with only 2 people  Don t even think that you can fit a 3rd person in the middle seat especially with a stick shift b Bed style  I ve got a fleet side  long bed  and I love it  Fleet side trucks are the only ones that will fit 4x8 sheets of anything  The only advantage I can see to a step side is that it may have more stylish lines  Even that is debatable  Oh yeah  and it might be easier to climb up into the bed  if you tend to need to get in there often b 4x4 or 4x2  If you live in any location that has snow please do not buy a 4x2 pickup truck  I can t tell you how many people in the Northeast I see with their 4x2 s loaded to the hilt with sandbags only to still have no traction  I load up my 4x4 with sandbags just so that I don t have to have the 4 wheel on as much  The extra ground clearance of a 4x4  while making the truck a little top heavy  is a great when you want to clear the 3 foot snowdrift that the plow left for you at the end of your driveway  My truck has locking hubs and a shifter on the floor to engage the four wheel drive  This is a really nice system as I only lock the hubs between November and April  snow season  The truck gets better gas mileage when the hubs are unlocked  When I need the four wheel I just shift the extra shifter  and it s on   even at full highway speed  Now the alternative is the push button four wheel drive which is the equivalent of having the hubs locked at all times  This means a little worse gas mileage  but a little easier operation  only having to push a single button whenever you want 4 wheel b So  what s so great about your Ranger b Well  the stick shift V6 is smooth as silk  There s plenty of power there for all road conditions  I can t vouch for the towing power until I get a nice toy to test it with  I have a rubberized floor which means a whisk broom and a hose cleans out the interior quickly  The seats are the most comfortable of any of the trucks I tested  Dodge  Chevy  Toyota  While the regular cab is small  I have no problem taking the truck on long trips  The aluminum alloy wheel are stylin  and non corrosive so they should stay shiny forever  The price was right   with new college grad discounts and rebate I only paid  15 000 for a brand new 4x4 set of wheels b What sucks about your Ranger b The thing didn t come with a cup holder  Now  this is not indicative of all Rangers because I ve seen other Rangers with cup holders  I guess it was just my combination of stick shift with 4 wheel drive shifter on the floor that made the designers think that they couldn t fit a cup holder  I managed to install one of my own no problem  The Regular cab   my next truck will have an extended cab  or be one of those SUP s  Sport Utility merged with a pickup  so that I ve got ample interior space  and still have a bed for hauling dirty stuff  The Black paint   for the reasons mentioned above All I can say is know what you re getting into before buying a small truck  They re not for everybody  If they re for you  I would definitely recommend buying a truck in the Ford Ranger series     
Pos, I recently purchased a 1997 Ford Ranger XLT  It is the 2 3 4 Cylinder engine with a 4 Speed Automatic  It is the single cab shortbed version  It s Caymen Green with a prarie tan cloth interior  First off  this truck was a screaming deal  it was very low mileage and the price was very nice and the dealership  Hemborg Ford of Norco  Ca  is a very reputible and good dealership  This truck feels solidly built  the ergonomics are some of the best for a compact  The standard engine is peppy enough to not aggravate you and the interior feels very nice  The stereo is the AM FM Cassette player and it sounds great for being stock  the A C will either freeze you or toast you if you overdo it  so needless to say  it works good  The ride is bouncy  but it s a truck so that s normal  but it does handle good  though  This is the beginning of a beautiful relationship  As of Mar  15  2002  my truck is still running strong  no squeeks or rattles of any kind  No mechanical problems  save for a burnt out lightbulb that was easily replaced and a flat tire due to broken glass  The Twin I Beam suspension is very competent off road as I found out in the Cajon Pass is So Cal  for a 4 banger with an auto tran  it hauls off road with only a touch of oversteer that is easily controled  I was expecting poor braking performance due to the rear drums  but I was pleasantly suprised about how good it stops  The only things that I don t like about it is that it has no tachometer and the speedlimit governer stops the party at 96 MPH when a lesser Toyota Tacoma tops at 105 MPH  Otherwise I m quite happy with it and when I get out of college and get a better paying job  I ll get a brand new Ranger   XLT or Edge   with the 4 0 Liter V6  5 Speed Automatic Transmission  4 Wheel Drive  CD Player  Power Equipment Group  Off Road Alloy Wheels and the 4 Door Supercab  
Pos, I bought My 1997 ranger not knowing a whole lot about trucks in general  and was pleasantly surprised with the test drive  It handles and accelerates fine  and is very handy when moving furniture and crates from place to place though I m guilty of not getting regular oil changes  I haven t had any mechanical problems  all of the instruments are easy to reach and operate  and the air conditioner will freeze most anyone  The cold missouri winters aren t a problem either  the cab is usually too hot over a long period of time  Be forewarned  please purchase the 4 wheel drive option  If you live ANYWHERE where the roads tend to ice up  kansas city  YOU WILL need it  I have to pile a minimum of five 35 lbs sandbags in the bed to have any traction at all  this is my only regret  and will buy another Ranger with that option when this one is paid for  Another problem is portions of Missouri roads are horrific  and I have potholes memorized for my route to from work  due to the fact that I have nearly lost control after hitting uneven patches of highway in my ranger  If the patches are unavoidable  the only option is to get off of the gas pedal  and ride out the turbulence  this is a small problem  at least for me  because the bad roads are only in particular areas  I can t fault Ford for Missouri s bad highway maintenance  so all in all  I m quite pleased with the Ranger 
Pos, We now own our third Ford Festiva  Well actually the first one was a Fiesta  the forerunner of the Festiva  it still has the same features actually  I am a happy camper here The durability is tops  The gas mileage is tops  We have traveled numerous miles in this auto spending very little in fuel or maintenance  It s economy features is astonishing  It s rugged and durable  Also  cheapest tires on the market If you are looking for economy this is it  If you are looking for luxury forget it  This auto was popular for it s economy  not quality of ride  I do not have a problem with it s ride  etc  I have thoroughly enjoyed each one we have owned   Bought all of them used It s sporty look and  cuteness  appeals to the young and old alike  I realize some are eye soars as with any automobile  and it s  savings  appeals to all  It s ease of parking is wonderful  squeeze into those tight spots that others have to drive away from  It has great pick up and go power  I prefer the automatic over the standard any day  however  the standard shift has more go power as with any standard really br br  
Pos, Okay I have to admit this is my first Ford  Up until 1997 when I bought my Ford Explorer Sport new  I had always been a Volkswagen girl  I LOVE the way Volkswagens handle and look but I spent more time gettin  them repaired then driving  em So in 1997  I decided to shop around for an SUV and fell in love with the Explorer Sport THe Explorer is the most reliable car I have owned  I never worry about getting stuck somewhere because the engine won t start or having it  die  on the freeway  NOT fun in L A  I have 70 000 miles on it and have only needed routine maintenance on it oil changes  filters  brakes  Oh and then there was that minor recall on the tires  Of course I m grateful that nobody was ever injured because of my Firestone tires  I have to admit though  that in my situation  the recall worked in my favor I had 60 000 miles on my car when the recall began and needed new tires I got 5 brand new tires for free  I should comment that since trading in my Firestones for better quality Michelins  the ride in much smoother  If you re worried about a  bumpy  Explorer  or any other SUV  the tires will make all the difference in the world Since I don t have children  the 2 door Sport works for me  If you have children or frequent rear seat passengers  you may want to consider the 4 door  In the Sport  the rear seat is not the easiest to get into and getting car seats in and out is time consuming The standard stereo with CD player sounds great speakers are high quality  I cannot drive without tunes in my car so this was important to me  The interior is attractive richer looking than other SUVs  in my humble opinion and the body style still looks current  despite Ford s yearly body style updates on Explorers The mileage is not that great I would say I get on average 15 16 MPG and I drive a 5 speed  still got the original clutch  When I lived 30 miles from work  60 miles roundtrip  this was a problem  Too much time and money at the gas station  But now that I am 4 miles from work  I only fill up once a week and am much happier  Poor gas mileage comes with owning a big car Ford Explorer or other I highly recommend the Ford Explorer  People tend to either love or hate Fords  I ve heard it all Ford stands for  Found On Road Dead  blah blah blah  but I can t say enough good things about my Ford  It is the best car I have owned  When I first purchased it  I thought I would keep it for 2  3 years tops  But why give up a good thing  
Pos, My husband and I like trucks for the fact that it does anything and everything you want  From moving yourself to transporting our dogs and anything else you need to going over terrain that most cars and some trucks can t even begin to handle  We have the extended cab version and it has six seats total  The only down fall is that the gas mileage is not that great  We average about 17 miles to the gallon  But there is two tanks that hold 32 gallons total so it is nice not having to hit the gas station so often  I also like the size you don t feel so small on the road parking is not that great but it is worth it for saftey reasons  I would recommend having a large vehicle for any family  I was in a wreck a drunk driver hit me from behind at about 50mph while we were sitting at a red light and We felt nothing it took out my bumper but that was all we were fine an the other van was very badly damaged  It pays to have a ford br br  
Pos, Working for the rescue squad in my city  I occasionally get the chance to drive a Ford Crown Victoria  We use them as chase cars  basically  but we call them zone cars  When an ambulance responds to a scene  a paramedic can chase the ambulance or beat the ambulance to the scene using one of these cars  Response time for paramedics is much more efficient this way  It keeps us extremely mobile  First I need to comment on the handling of these cars  There are plenty of other vehicles out there which would have worked just fine for the job we use the vehicles for  but I can see why the city chose to use these above all others  They handle like a dream  They have a very tight grip on the road  and the steering is not lose at all and has little to no play in it  unlike the majority of Ford built vehicles  The seats  in addition to this  are designed deep in an effort to keep you in place while going around curves  All of these factors take a big role when you are traveling at 90mph through rush hour traffic with lights and sirens at full blast  With that said  we are glad they have airbags as well  Next on the list  the power  I m not sure what size engines these cars are normally sold with  it could be the same size we have  or it might not  The ones we use sport a 4 6L V8  I could be wrong though  because they may just very well be sold to the general public the same way they are to us  minus the white paint  reflective stripe down the sides that say rescue  and the red and white strobe light bar on top  Considering the size engine they have in them  I have noticed that they still have excellent gas mileage  It usually ranges from 20 to 21 miles per gallon  This may not seem like much  but just think of how many times we gun the engine with these cars everyday  Also keep in mind that they are usually left running all the time at scenes  For an added bonus  in case most people don t know  strobe lights  sirens  a computer  and several radios draw a lot of power from that hard working alternator  and to make up for it the city sets the engines to run at a high idle  Even after all this abuse they can still conserve a considerable amount of gas  Now for the room in the vehicle  They have a very large amount of space  We can carry everything an ambulance has on board  with the exception of the stretcher  and still have plenty of room for a couple of passengers  Most of the equipment will fit in the trunk  if not all of it if you position it right  Along with tools  a jack  and the spare tire  The space in the front is very good as well  Located up there is a clipboard  many map books  a mounted computer  several radios  the control panel for the lights and sirens  and yes  still room for passengers  I think these cars are very comfortable   I have to drive them constantly around the city for 12 hours at a time  and by the end of the day  other than being tired of working  I still feel just as comfortable as I did when I first got into the car  A direct quote given to me from one of the people that spends much of their duty time in a zone car  The city garage maintains the cars  however we still get the chance to see what repairs have been made  if any  They go into the city garage once a month for preventative maintenance  and for the most part  all we have seen done on these cars is fluid changes  engine cleaning  and adjusting the alignment  balance  rotation  and changing tires  I can say that the tires seem to get worn more often than a lot of other cars  but once again  look how we drive these cars  and besides  a different tire brand could help that  but our city is pretty stubborn  Once in a great while something other than that will have to be repaired  but what car does that not happen on  If you can find one  let me know because I am going to own one soon  Generally speaking  as much as these cars get beat up every day  I am amazed at their ability to stay in great working condition  One owned as a private vehicle would work positive wonders on your maintenance bill  These cars are built very solid  They can absorb much force in a collision  They are designed to do just that  absorb most of the impact and protect the driver  Loaded down with brake and sudden motion activated seat belts  dual airbags  shatterless windows  and a crumbling body  they can be trusted to get you to where you need to be safely  They even have a very sturdy roof  If you re wondering where I became familiar of how well the car protects the driver  they have been rolled  wrapped around poles  had head on collisions  been T boned  rear ended  etc  etc  and drivers walked away from all of it with nothing more than seatbelt sores  airbag abrasions  and a bruised ego  statement based on info gathered from sources in this rescue squad  as well as the local police departments  I have yet to wreck one  and I hope I don t  
Pos, I bought this car as a repairable for  3k and I am glad I did  In the condition I have it in now  it is valued at  6 000  Anyway  it is a great first car for a student and is very safe with dual front Air Bags  The seating is comfortable for about a few hours  then may get a little tiring  No long road trips  I was a little hesitant to get on the freeway  the car being so small in all  for the first time but a few times after  It was all right  I strongly recommend this car  I have had a great time driving this around town  Seeing it is so small  it can go anywhere   Not that far in deep snow  trust me on that one  I put a new Sony sound system  Yes  all Sony in a car  It sounds good  in it a few months after I bought it  the previous owner did not take care of the old one  I would recommend the four door model over the two door because it has Power Steering and it is easier for the rear seat passengers to get in  I would also recommend  for those in the North like me  to get one with a Rear defroster or have an after market one installed  I also recommend getting A C  Little cars with big windows get pretty warm in the summer  When looking for an Aspire  look for one with under 60 000 miles I bought mine with 43 000 on it and it has run fine  A friend of mine bought one with 96 000 and has had to have the transmission and various other things replaced  If Ford was still making the Aspire  I would send the  11 000 base price and buy another  
Pos, The Ford Contour is a nice  roomy  little sports car that won t sack you in the wallet  It s got the option of a sporty engine  still small liters for good gas mileage  a 2 5 liter V 6 under the hood that packs a little kick behind the pedal  It has a lot of room in the back for all of the passengers or any other cargo that you had to carry  The trunk is really big so you can fit whatever you need it to  The steering is tight and responsive  and the car is solid  I drive cars hard and have yet to have a problem with this one  The stereo is what really shocked me though  For a Ford stock radio and speakers  it really sounds nice  I have the stock tape deck  I don t think that they offer any other options for the radio  but I could be wrong  All in all  the contour is a nice car for a little money if you re in the market for a small compact car  It has good gas mileage  which is necessary for these recent gas price increases and it handles beautifully  The suspension and other parts of the car should last you for a long time  It is a good buy if you want a small car br br  
Pos, Sporty  sturdy  cute   that s what I thought when I first saw the Contour on the lot of my local  and thankfully  reputable  used car dealer  Overall  I have been very pleased with the gas mileage  drive ability and passenger room  Also  the car looks great and  feels  great  All of the buttons are reachable and the cup holders are a great feature Here are the issues 1  The trunk  It leaks  Granted  this may have been the result of an unreported collision by the car s first owner  However  it took me three trips to my local Ford dealer  the car was still under warranty  to fix the problem 2  The recalls  They re copious  Every other day I seem to get a friendly  but pointed letter asking me to bring the car back to a licensed Ford dealer for yet another tune up  While I genuinely appreciate Ford s commitment to their drivers  safety  I wish they would iron out these issues before the cars come to market  My mechanic and I are becoming best friends br br  
Pos, When we purchased our 1991 Ford Thunderbird Sport with a V8 and automatic almost 5 years ago I really had to do some convincing to get my husband to buy a Ford  He has always been a Chevy man  I must say  it has turned out to be a really good decision on our part  We wanted something big enough to accommodate 3 children in the back seat because we weren t ready for becoming a minivan family  and this car is perfect to seat 2 car seats and another child comfortably in the back My Thunderbird has 106 000 miles on it and we have only experienced two minor problems  One is the transmission gave out a few years ago and my husband contacted a transmission guy he knows who told him how to fix it with practically a twist of a wrench  Of course my husband is a mechanic  so maybe he just made it look easy  It still slips on really cold mornings but it s something I have learned to live with and expect  As soon as the car warms up  the transmission stops slipping The second thing that we have experienced is a headlight problem  We will be driving down the road at night and suddenly the headlights will go out  My husband has replaced the headlight switch and it didn t remedy the problem  A friend of his who owns a Ford says that he also has this problem with his headlights so maybe it is a known problem that can be easily fixed  I don t drive a whole lot after dark so this isn t a real major problem for me but it is quite bothersome when I do have to drive at night Those are the only two problems we have ever had out of our Thunderbird and it is 9 years old at this point so I am very impressed with it  And we aren t easy on the old gal either  It has primer on the door panel where I had a slight mishap  and she gets way over due on her oil changes but she just keeps on trucking along for us  I have been really happy with the ride  comfort  and the reliability and I would recommend the 1991 Thunderbird to any of my friends br br  
Pos,  Cruising In My Big T b  I have had my  91 Thunderbird for 4 years now  bought it way back in my freshman year and it has served me well throughout college  I am a horrible Northern driver and brutal on my vehicles  but this piece of Ford craftsmanship refuses to bail out on me  It s a rough and tumble vehicle that remains an incredible deal for the price  especially when bought used from a reputable dealer b The Advantages  1 Seat Space These are big seats people  with the kind of legroom that only those pretentious you know whats in first class usually get their hands on  And that spaciousness isn t just about spoiling the people up front either  it extends to the back seat as well  which means that everyone feels just a little bit more comfortable and relaxed when you get to wherever you re going And not only are the seats big  but the generous amount of padding in each makes for an especially comfortable ride 2 Appearance I ve gt to admit it to you  I just love the look of the Thunderbird  though it is an acquired taste to be sure  I can best describe the style as  quot Italian quot  sleek in a chunky way and available in colors  like burgundy  that make it look like a cross between a hit mobile and a hearse 3 Smooth Ride Riding in my Thunderbird has always seemed quite smooth to me  especially when you consider how low to the ground it is  Why so low  That kind of positioning allows the Thunderbird to provide the rider with great control  as your  quot feel quot  for the road is significantly enhanced In the same arena as the ride is the ease of use of the console  which for me equals smoothness and ease  The Thunderbird s radio and air console is incredibly well designed with everything within reach and intuitively organized  Seem trivial to you  Try changing the station at 75 miles an hour and see how important knob placement is 4 Trunk This is a important feature for me  as I seem to move every 3 6 months  The trunk on the Thunderbird is big enough for all of your luggage  not to mention the corpse of Vinnie The Chin from a rival family b My Defense  I have read another review of this vehicle that criticizes the brake quality  and I have to vehemently disagree with it  I ride my brakes hard  and I have never had a lockup or other incident  The brakes do tend to squeek a bit  but the noise is no indication of a performance issue b The Final Verdict  The bottom line is that the Thunderbird is a comfortable and well designed car at a reasonable price  As long as you like burgundy vehicles and live in an area that s at least 30  Italian  the Thunderbird is a great option br br  
Pos, I arrived in the states from Australia at the end of March 1999 to stay there for a year and come home at the end of March 2000  I stayed with friends in South Carolina who is a Ford man as I have always owned GM or Chevs  they lent me a 1979 red corvette until I bought myself a car so after 3 months I did buy a 1985 Z28 Camaro  350  to fix up and use for the 9 months after looking at it I thought this was a bad idea so looked in the local paper and found a red 1991 V8 Thunderbird with 114 000 miles on it for  3000 After taking it for a test drive offered the lady  2800 and drove it home  it had a slight water leak from the water pump  so while replacing it I installed a set of under drive pulleys  which I could notice the power increase the first time I drove it  put a K amp N air cleaner in as well I had a friend come over from Australia so we drove from Greenville SC across to Sequin TX  did about 3000 miles in that trip  we took the long way  and had no trouble at all and got 27 MPG sitting on 80  MPH had a radar detector  it has a highway ratio in it 2 75 My brother came over from Australia so we went from Greenville SC down to Daytona Beach and back  then drove across America to California  which we did about 4600 miles trouble free  When we left Williams AZ the car was buried under snow as we had a cold snap and snow dig the snow away and turn the key starting the engine at once and never missing a beat The car came with the premium sound system  but the radio cassette was playing up so replaced it with a Pioneer radio CD I went to the wreckers and bought an electric motor seat assembly for the right hand side so when converting to RHD will have an electric adjustment  Also bought a sports instrument cluster and centre handbrake assy out of a super coupe These cars were never made for export or for Right Hand Drive  so have to get all the parts needed now for conversion I did 18 000 miles in 9 months without the car stopping or letting me down I gave the car 4 oil changes  added fuel octane booster with every tank of gas  it has the factory 15 quot  alloy wheels with Michelin tyres  I found the car very easy to drive and steer  but did experience brake shudder  which appears to be a common problem due to thin brake rotors I added a rear spoiler and had the windows tinted  which makes the car look sporty  as in Australia the only 2 door cars are mainly Jap imports  so in the end I shipped the car back to Australia where I have to convert it over to Right Hand Drive for our road rules  this cars owes me  10 000 Australia  5200 US  landed back at my house in Australia  which when converted to RHD they sell from  35 000 to  40 000  18 000 to  21 000 US BEST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED br br  
Pos, This review is about  Ford Mustang 3 8L Coupe  with stick shift I test drove when I considered buying it  I say  considered  because I did not buy it and here is why b Test Drive  The dealer talked too much during the test drive  They always try to do that to distract you  but I noticed the following things b Styling  You can argue  but I think it could be better  The car looks bulky  the C pillars are thick  which increases  blind spots    I was afraid to run over somebody while backing up  the standard wheels look crude  The previous Mustang looked more balanced b Engine  The 3 8L 193 hp engine does not seem all that powerful  even with stick  We went on the freeway onramp and I was disappointed  Strange  considering the 220  lb ft of torque rating at as low as 2800 rpm  European and Japanese manufacturers manage to extract more than 200 hp out of 3 0 liter engines Note  the A C was on during the test drive and was very efficient  It might eat some power  but not that much b Transmission  The shifter has quite short travel  which is good  but the clutch does not provide any feedback   you cannot feel it engage by the pedal pressure  or the dealer talked too much  The clutch also engaged very high in the pedal travel  I drove some Eastern European cars for several years and never had complaints like this one  Or maybe I m getting old and grumpy b Suspension  The suspension is not only stiff  but creates a lot of unnecessary up and down motions  The car uses live axle in the rear  so I didn t expect much anyway b Standard Equipment  The list of standard equipment looks good  It includes power windows  mirrors  locks and remote keyless entry  alloy  ugly  wheels  AM FM CD cassette player  A C  dual vanity mirrors  etc b Interior  Interior  materials  fit and finish  looks cheap  I did not expect walnut for  16K  but Ford could have done better  As I said  the C pillars are wide  in coupe  and the interior room is smaller than I d like  The steering wheel tilts but does not telescope  which might be a problem for the tall people b Insurance and Safety  Insurance rates are high  especially if you are a male younger than 25  The crash test results are not encouraging either   the overall rating is  Acceptable  with  Poor  death rate and  Marginal  injury rate b Fuel Economy  I didn t get a chance to see the actual fuel consumption myself  but on paper it s 19 MPG city   29 MPG highway  Not impressive for the car of this size with manual transmission b Warranty and Reliability  b Consumer Reports b  magazine says that Mustang has poor reliability  Ford provides 36 000 mile   3 year warranty and 5 year corrosion warranty  Majority of other manufacturers offers 60 000 mile   5 year powertrain warranty  100 000 mile   10 year warranty for Hyundai Kia The last three  safety  fuel economy and reliability  also depend on the way you drive b Pricing  The price was good  in theory  I know that you can get the car for less than  16K  at CarsDirect com  for example  but the particular dealership I went to wanted more than  17K and did not want to negotiate the price at all  Besides they were very pushy and rude  Needles to say  they did not earn my business  they didn t even try The dealer was constantly asking what monthly payment I can afford  Well  I can afford the payment I need to get better car  I walked  after which they called me several times asking how they can make me buy the car  today  I was unable to produce any kind of positive reply on this one I In car buying a lot depends on personal taste  If you like Mustang s styling and features and decide to buy it  it is a good deal  providing you with electric everything  remote keyless entry  radio CD cassette  V6 engine and alloy wheels for less than  16  If you want refinement  fit and finish  safety and reliability  get ready to pay more for something else I  
Pos, Ford has made little or no buzz about the fact that the current Ford Mustang is based on the current longest living platform in the American auto industry and probably of the American market as well  the current Mustang is based in the Fox platform first used in the 1978 Ford Fairmont   Mercury Zephyr  Maybe they are not sure whether this is a good or a bad thing to let people know  If you ask me I think is a great thing  Why  Lets see First  Mustang was able to retain the rear wheel drive configuration that is the way a pony car is meant to be  In the late 80 s Ford tried to make a front wheel driver out of the Mustang but at the very last minute they backed up  The result was the Ford Probe  not a bad car in any respect  but definitely not a Mustang  Maybe a Celica or a Prelude but not a Mustang Second  Is really cheap to buy  own  maintain and repair Third  Ford has had over 24 years to improve this platform and it shows Mustang 3 8 V 6 Convertible Ride  The Ford Mustang 3 8 V 6 convertible with a stick shift is a really fun car to drive  In a very different and less relaxed way however  than more sophisticated entries in the market  Mustang is all about rough power and it shows all the time  Is a throw back to the days of the original pony cars but with a very contemporary feel  provided by a extremely well behave steering  quick to respond and very linear  The ride is the best you can expect from a rear wheel driver with a solid axle rear suspension and that does not mean is bad at all  It actually is a very enjoyable ride with a very distinctive American flavor  Cowl shake is not nearly as bad as you would expect from a convertible in this price field  but there is some  which I guess is the price you have to pay in exchange for the pleasures of open air motoring  Interior  Seats are supportive enough if you are not an NBA player and there is plenty of space in the front cabin  and nearly none in the back  which anyway is a given in the pony car segment  Interior materials are far from being the best and I would advice to take a good look at Ford s accessories catalog to personalize an  although well designed  monochromatic and cheap looking interior  None of the above means that the instrumentation is not well laid out and that controls are not at the reach of your hand when needed Power  Power is more than adequate  190 hp inV 6 form moves the Mustang convertible from 0 to 60 mph in 7 7 seconds  this is former GT territory Top  Convertible top is simple  fast and powered  Two latches  one switch and no roof Many may not agree  but to me Mustang looks super sexy especially in convertible form The current Mustang is the best value you can find if what you are looking for is power  No other car offers you such bang for your buck  now that the Camaro   Firebird twins were killed by corporate father GM  and those two were super uncomfortable cars anyway The all new 2004 Ford Mustang will be based in the DEW98 platform  the state of the art base for the Ford Thunderbird  Lincoln LS and Jaguar S Type  That will be a whole different proposition and will see about it then Surprisingly good quality 
Pos, The 2001 Mustang is a fun car to drive and look at  With its rear wheel drive it handles the corners quite nicely  Be careful on wet pavement though  as the tires fight to get traction  The v 6 engine has some pep in it  This car really takes off from a stand still  Passing cars on the highway is not a problem as the engine has a lot in reserve  Two small problems with the engine  First  between 35 50 mph  the engine seems to lose power and gets sluggish  Secondly  when you accelerate it takes a few seconds for the engine to respond  When it does respond  though  you do have some decent power  If you are looking for performance  I would recommend getting the GT  v 8  When you get to the interior of the car  you start to see where Ford cut costs  The light knobs  a c controls are very cheap looking  If you want rear floor mats for this car  you have to purchase them seperately  The glove compartment is too small  and in a very inconvenient location  I do like the OPTIONAL mach 4 audio system  It is well worth the extra money IF you want a decent stereo system  The body styling of the Mustang is beautiful  Many people tend to stare at the Mustang longer than most cars One complaint  the front end Where the optional flood lights would go  the Mustang has some plastic air vents These break EASILY and it somewhat ruins the look of the car  The antenna is in an awkward place and it also detracts from the look of the Mustang  Overall  the Mustang delivers a decent sports car for the price  
Pos, With the upcoming demise of the GM F body cars  the Mustang remains the first and last of a long breed of American muscle  The 2001 Mustang GT certainly holds itself to some pretty steep standards  and it does just fine in meeting them too First off  let s talk power  The thing is rated at 260hp and 300  lb feet of torque  For those of you who don t know what those numbers mean  it s fast  At 260hp it s easily out muscled by Camaros and Trans Ams  but not much  if anything  else in the general price range provides the tire shredding power that a properly driven GT can produce  and the F Bodies generally cost a little more anyway  Mine is  temporarily  and automatic  so I lose a little in the 0 60 and 1 4 mile numbers  but it s still no slouch  Onramps have never been this much fun and passing is a breeze  The motor responds well to pressure on the pedal but isn t as harsh as many of the other big V 8s  With the traction control  it even survives hard mashing on the accelerator so you get some extra traction that s somewhat atypical of RWD muscle  The exhaust looks and sounds good  but I would have preferred a slightly throatier note from it Next up is the handling  This thing hugs curves like a car half its weight  You have to be careful because the short  light backend is highly prone to scampering out from under you  but on dry  clean pavement this thing holds the road tight and doesn t let go  Just watch it in the rain though  and snow is out of the question On to more practical items  the car is fairly comfortable considering its lineage  I have charcoal gray leather and they look good and feel very supportive  but not hard  The ride is  however  jarring because the suspension is fairly stiff to accomodate it s excellent handling  It can grow tiresome very quickly on constantly rough pavement  Also  don t try to shove anyone except the smallest children in the back  Anyone over about 10 years of age is not going to be please with you otherwise Gas mileage is acceptable  but this is a moderate size V8  so don t expect miracles  I get about 19 26 with my driving habits The car  overall  looks good  The interior overcomes the annoying Ford  plastic dollhouse  look and  unlike say the Probe  doesn t look cheap and flimsy at all  In fact  what clinched the Mustang for me over a brand new Tiburon GT  besides the extra power  was the less cheesy looking insides of the Mustang  The paint is also very nicely done  The only issue I have with the looks is the plastic inserts in the fake hood scoop and side  vents  From a distance they look fine  but up close they re not very attractive  I might go so far as to recommend actually removing them from the side  vents The only complaints I have otherwise are that the transmission in the automatic is somewhat sloppy for a purported Muscle Sports car  It doesn t like to shift too hard which hurt performance  However  the stick has issues of it s own  so I would recommend following my lead and just get a good aftermarket system if you don t want to live with the annoyances of the stock 5 speed and the power loss of the automatic  
Pos, When picking out my first car  I had a lot of factors I considered  First  I wanted a car that was fun to drive and attractive  I also needed a reliable that was under  15 000  At first  I didn t realize that I could afford a 2001 Mustang  I found a great deal  and purchased my red Mustang  It was once a rental car  and it has 15 800 miles  There are three types of Mustangs  The 194 horsepower V6  the GT V8  and the high performance Cobra  I purchased the V6 with the Deluxe package   ABS  traction control  power seat  spoiler  CD I ve owned the car for about 7 months  and I haven t encountered a problem yet  The car is very fun to drive  When driving around town  the car quickly accelerates and passing is very easy  However  all this power means below average fuel economy  I ve been averaging 18 miles per gallon  The steering communicates lots of road feel  and the car handles well  The car has the firm ride of a sports car  and is relatively quiet  The brakes are exceptional Inside  the Mustang is well finished  The cabin has a high quality feel for the price  All the controls are within reach and very well designed  and the cup holders are of the best in any car I ve seen  The sound system provides great quality  even with the base system  One weakness with the car is the lack of rear seat room  and the small trunk  However  most people in the sports car market don t have a spacious rear seat on the top of their priority list Overall  the Mustang is an excellent car  A sports car should be fast  attractive  and fun  The Mustang has all these qualities and then some  which is why it has been one of America s most popular sports cars for almost 40 years  
Pos,  Captured by the styling b  I have to admit  we were captured by the appearance of the 2001 GT Convertible  As teenagers in the early 70 s  the stying is obviously a through back to that era  We love looks b Strong V8 b  Although I wouldn t want to race a 325 h p  Camero SS  the 260 h p  V 8 has an amazing amount of power  Ford must have also done their homework in producing the exhaust note of this engine  It has a beautiful  beefy sound under acceleration  but is quiet at steady speeds   Small but comfortable on the inside b  I am 6 1  and 230 lbs  but feel very much at home in the cockpit of the Mustang  One caveat though  if you opt for standard interior instead of the premium  the seats are much less comfortable  a least for a guy my size  Make sure to test both before deciding b Good fit and finish b  I have read less then favorable remarks about the fit and finish on the Mustang  However  I am very pleased  We own both a new style Camero and the Mustang  The Mustang seems to have more durable components in the cab then our Camero  Time will tell as we have only had the Mustang since June of 2001   Relatively poor gas mileage b  To date  I have only one minor complaint about the car it is thirsty  We average 16 miles to gallon in town  I guess we should have expected this  but I actually thought it might be closer to 20  
Pos, I ve been driving a 2000   6 cylinder  4 door  4wd Explorer for six months now  So far it has its ups and downs  The ups  you sit higher and get a better feel for the road  it reacts quicker than most vehicles because of its short wheel base  plenty of room to stretch my big feet  The downs  although better than some SUVs it drinks gas like a dog on a hot day  the interior is fairly noisy  it is not the ideal choice for towing large loads The instrument panel is put together very well  It is easy to read and everything important is exactly where you want it to be  The back seats fold down easily to make an eight foot bed  Plenty of room for spreading out a sleeping bag I wish it had a cable release for the back window  The back door  which lifts up  has a glass that can also be opened up  Ideal for putting small items in the back without having to put all you weight into shutting the big door  This window lacks a release from the inside  You have to open it from the back door I titled this review  quot Explod er quot  because of the tire incident this past summer  I believe you should really look hard at this vehicle before buying it  The Explorer certainly fits some lifestyles  but for others there are better vehicles br br  
Pos, I have purchased an 1989 SHO sedan with 97k miles  2 900 in 3 2000 vs   4800 book  and a 1990 LX sedan with 85k miles  3 000 in 8 1998 vs   4500 book  Both were mint condition  no damage and like new inside and nearly new outside  Both have proven to be solid cars  reliable  and safe  However  if you are considering these vehicles  you must get them at a price that allows you to address the maintenance and repairs that are common to this vehicle  The repairs that will typically cause the owners to sell are front axle boots drive joints  engine rear seal  oil leak  and cooling system leaks  particularly the heater block which is inside the fire wall and very difficult to replace  At times there can be engine block problems  particularly with the 3 8 engine  usually caused by people driving away without allowing some warm up time I didn t have the vehicles checked by a mechanic  I used my relatively good judgment on condition  After investing  1 000 in the 1990 and  1600 in the 89 SHO  I have two vehicles that are in my opinion as good as new  certainly good for 75 000 to 100 000 more   I care for my vehicles  currently with a Corsica 1990 at 193 000 and still going strong Since I was buying very well cared for cars and still had to pay for major repairs  I urge you to only purchase one of these vehicles at below book  even below average wholesale  For example  my SHO carried an average wholesale over  3000 and retail  4800  but I bought for  2900  You must anticipate these repairs  If the seller does not believe you  go to the NTSB web page and printout the repair and recall lists for the Taurus in those years and show them what to expect  I do not wish to scare you away with these stories  these are very good  solid cars if you find well cared for ones  However  the design has flaws which once fixed   and usually with upgraded Ford redesigned parts that replaced the original design  you end up with a super  very reliable car  Just anticiate the extra investment These are solid  heavy cars that even with no airbag or one airbag will often in an accident hammer the other vehicle as hard as a SUV  Remember  bulk and weight are very important when in an accident  the heavy guy usually wins  The SHO has a 5 speed  the LX an automatic  The LX is loaded with everything like climate control  electric seats  etc  all continue to work well  The SHO has many sport car luxuries  such as sun roof  fog lamps  powerful engine  etc  The automatic has had no problems  but the clutch plate for the SHO must be upgraded because the original is too weak  and will fail  If this was not done by the original owner  anticipate a  700 repair  by an honest good reasonable shop  twice that by a dishonest shop br br  
Pos, the 1990 year ford taurus is a excellent family car there is ample room for cross town trip or cross country trips  the ford taurus gives you a very reliable means of transportation and you get very good gas mileage on average i get 27 mpg in town and 36 mpg highway  this car is a good car for some one with a family but i would not recommend that you get a taurus for a young adult if they a sports car kind of driver it is not made to be driven like that  the ford taurus does have very well take off and is a very reliable car and very comfortable car to drive or ride in br br  
Pos, I bought this Taurus used in 1996 for   5 800 00 with 63 000 miles on it and have had it ever since  I have kept up with the maintenance  and the car has served me well  It only left me stranded once during all these years  and even then the mechanics could not figure out what had happened  It would not do that ever again The car rides comfortably and the radio works well  I am still on the original 1990 factory radio  The display has long burned out  but i have memorized all my presets Repairs have included  replaced alternator and battery in the fall of 1999  replaced front shocks in spring of 1999  replaced water pump in the fall of 2000  replaced a c system in June 2001 Considering the age of the car  it is not too bad  I have 135 000 miles on it and will drive it till it disintegrates into small particles  
Pos, The ubiquitous minivan is frequently sold on consumer feel good items such as the placement and size of cup holders  the presence of map pockets or the number of zones in which the climate control can be split   Ford s 2000 Windstar  does well on these creature comfort areas  but excels in safety and reliability   critical areas for the family oriented minivan market segment  I just spent a week driving the Windstar through a variety of street and weather conditions  This is the third minivan I ve test driven in the last five months  and so far  is my favorite  I still haven t driven the  Honda Odyssey  which has better all around numbers  but the  Windstar performs better than the Plymouth Grand Voyager and its Dodge Caravan twin   Since this was Dodge s baby to begin with  that s a hard statement to write  but Ford has done a terrific job with this van b THE RIDE  Feel the acceleration  The Windstar has plenty of get up and go  There s a 3 8 liter V6 with 200 hp  more of both than the Odyssey or the Grand Caravan  This van has torque to spare with 240 foot pounds at 3600 rpm  again better than both vehicles  I found myself passing slower moving vehicles with just a tap on the responsive accelerator  There was always plenty of power left over to respond to changing road conditions I also found the ride itself to be smooth  The Windstar weighs a good 100 pounds more than the Grand Voyager  and although neither are in serious big SUV territory at just under 4000 pounds  they are solid  The Windstar s wheelbase is bigger than I would have liked  at over 120 inches  contributing to a bigger than expected turning radius  Several times I found myself faced with the choice of making a three point turn or doing some curb cutting  I knew that acceleration was there for some reason The Windstar s critics have complained of the same top heavy  swaying feeling I found in the Grand Voyager   I didn t find much swaying at all  even when accelerating in curves   In fact  the biggest criticism I could find on the ride was that there is a small but significant blind spot just off the right rear bumper  Some jiggling with mirrors restricted from field of vision to other sides  but stopped me from driving several smaller cars off the road b SAFETY  Let s face it  Families buy minivans  And along with reliability  family buyers treasure safety above every other attribute  Airbags  including side airbags  are standard on this vehicle  but that only comprises a small portion of safety  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA or http www nhtsa gov  is the agency responsible for crash testing vehicles for the federal government  They gave the Windstar 5 stars out of a possible 5 for crash worthiness  A safety group run for the insurance industry  the Highway Loss Data Institute  found that the addition of the side air bags made the Windstar one of the safest passenger van in its 40 mph crash tests  The van finished third behind the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey in their tests  This was actually a step down for the Windstar  which used to be rated as best in its class  but the Odyssey s redesign catapulted the 2000 model over the Windstar  Still  these three vehicles were the only ones to receive HLDI s overall  good  rating in their class Self sealing tires and a reverse sensor system that alerts the driver when the rear bumper is within five feet of something are safety options that are well worth considering  Ford has packaged multiple options into several safety packages  so depending on what you want to put on your van  you might find it cheaper to buy a package than to add single options b CREATURE COMFORTS  The very first thing I noticed when I settled into the driver s seat was the ledge over the window well  It s a perfect height for resting a driver s arm  yes  I know you should drive with two hands on the wheel  These little things  like the aforementioned cup holders and map pockets  make a surprising amount of difference in overall consumer protection  And speaking of the cup holders  the two recessed under the ashtray in the front were adjustable and fit different sized cups with a simple squeeze of the ratcheted plastic ring  I was very impressed with the interior lighting  which gave plenty of directed illumination at night without making it difficult to continue driving  Even the climate controls for the passengers in the rear two rows are illuminated at night   a nice feature that not every minivan shares The stereo was big and bold sounding with the requisite tuning and pseudo equalizer buttons  I particularly liked the oversized radio station buttons The stems off the steering wheel were the only item that caused me concern  On the right side stem  the driver finds the gear shift lever with the overdrive button recessed into the tip  That s simply annoying design  but the dangerous design is on the left side stem which controls turn signals and dual interval wiper systems  On more than one occasion  I signaled for a left turn only to unexpectedly spray the windshield with fluid and start the wipers  The turn signal control is a silly place to put a wiper button anyway  That said  the dual interval wipers are neat and do a tremendously good job in maintaining visibility through even heavy rain Interior visibility is terrific  however  thanks to a mini mirror that swings down between the driver and passenger seats in front  This is not intended as a rear view mirror  but as a way to watch folks even in the back row  Parents with kids are going to love this feature because it doesn t detract at all from the rear view mirror and is easily seen from either driver or passenger seat Finally  the killer comfort issue was found on the fourth door  Yes  the Windstar is available as a four door unit too  perfect for families who can enter on driver or passenger side  I also found that the bucket seats in the second row were nice and roomy while the third row bench seat easily folded down or was removed   THE BOTTOM LINE  Auto dealers are still getting near sticker price for the Honda Odyssey  last year s minivan darling  If price is a factor at all  I find that the Windstar stacks up very favorably against the Odyssey and now is the time to buy 2000 models since the 2001s are now in stock  Ford is also trying to move

Pos, This is my first vehicle that is not a car  I have never owned a motorcycle  motorhome  pickup truck or anything else other than mostly big roomy sedans  I like my creature comforts when tooling down the highway enroute to one golf resort or another  With about a year left to go on the Oldsmobile I got to thinking about minivans  and decided to do some research  I relied  too  on a friend who is now in his third straight minivan  no Fords for advice on what  besides the cupholders  are the advantages of minivan ownership  I used the Internet to do the research  relying heavily on Kelly Blue Book  www kbb com   and www edmunds com  Both are really good sites whether you are buying or leasing  and whether it s a car or a truck  Bottom line is that between them and my buddy  although he is absolutely not a Windstar guy  I decided that if I was getting a minivan it was going to be Ford s  It was a close call over the Honda Odyssey  Truth is there are a lot of great vehicles out there nowadays  Maybe you won t go wrong with any of them  but I am thinking that for the money you can t get much safer or more comfortable  I ve been driving mine now for about four months  and I believe that I am ready to evaluate it  I don t know much at all about the technical stuff  but I do know that I am satisfied with the gas mileage  The ride is nice  of course  when your vehicle is new you are careful to miss most bumps larger than a bottlecap  but nevertheless I did not miss a few and I can tell you from experience  It s a nice ride  I got the SE model with the  quot radar quot  in the back  That s the rear sensing system that saved me from an accident in a supermarket parking lot this past week  I never saw the guy  and I never would have had a chance if it wasn t for that alarm going off just in the nick of time  It s been the better part of 30 thirty years since I hit something I wasn t aiming at  and I can tell you I am real grateful for this alarm system  It would have been a minor ding I am sure  but it would have ruined a great driving record  Thanks again Ford  If this model doesn t have enough bells and whistles for you  well I gotta tell you that you are pretty spoiled  No matter though  they have two others  I think  loaded with even more stuff if you have to have it  The right side back door opens and closes at the push of a button  That s pretty neat  makes me wish I had gotten the left door that way too  You know what else is pretty neat  the outside mirrors   not only are they  quot powered mirrors quot  they are heated  To melt the ice which we will be getting our fair share of starting any day now  No more scraping mirrors  Works for me  I could go on with what I like about it  but if you re looking to buy one of these or one of the competition s versions  then I better tell you what I don t like about it as well  Gotta be fair  The right front door cannot be opened with a key   there is NO keyhole  My vehicle has  quot keyless entry quot  so I shouldn t complain  but I don t keep that little  quot doo jigger quot  on my keyring  It s my emergency backup in case I stupidly leave my keys in the car  again  and sometimes it would be handy to access that door with a key  For someone else or for packages  for example  I am not crazy about my cupholders  The ones in the front section of the car just under the radio that you have to pull out like a drawer  Well  they re a little chintzy if you ask me  I don t trust them to hold my medium diet pepsi  and they don t hold my coffee mug  So  what are they good for  Like the song says  quot Absolutely Nothin quot  The only other thing that really bugs me is the back door lift gate or whatever they call it  If anything ought to be  quot powered quot  this is it  I m guessing that if there is one feature that costs Ford the most customers this would have to be it  I believe that the Ford people would do well to hire themselves a woman engineer to check this door out from the point of view of people who are less than 6 1  220  and make it so it s a wee bit more user friendly  Dumbest door I ve ever seen  If you are thinking minivan for your next purchase  You might want to just take my word for it  I did the research  Windstar is a good deal br br  
Pos, I ve recently purchased a 2000 Ford Windstar LX  We traded in our 1996 Windstar and are very pleased with the refinements that Ford has continued to make to the Windstar with each successive model year Ford was a little late in adding the  fourth sliding door  option and quite frankly they were probably caught a little bit by surprise when Chrysler introduced this innovation to the minivan market a couple of years ago  But while Chrysler and GM were adding the additional door Ford was continuing to place an emphasis on Safety and Ride Quality  The Windstar is the only Domestic Mini Van with a 5 Star Collision rating and for the year 2000 side impact air bags are an option  The Windstar is adequately powered  however  you pay dearly for the additional boost in the anemic gas mileage you ll get  The Windstar has a decent road feel but steering can at times feel vague  But the Windstar is relatively easy to maneuver  is quiet and is quite pleasant to drive and ride in  The Captains seats are well padded and comfortable and are quite improved from earlier models  The 6 way power driver s seat option with lumbar support adjustment is highly recommended Also  optional is on the LX is remote controlled automatic passenger s side sliding door  This is a great convenience when toting small children  Ford also offers a premium sound package with a CD player as an upgrade for about  300  The sound is exceptional for a factory installed system  Also  recommended is the rear heat and air option  This allows all passengers to ride in comfort The styling on the 2000 model has also been refined  The front end is more rounded  imitating Chrysler s styling initiatives  But on the plus side this also seems to have improved visibility over the front nose of the van  Next time your in a parking lot look at all the bent front license plates on earlier Windstar models  Due to poor visibility over the nose  Windstar drivers were are constantly hitting parking rail guards  A minor irritation becomes evident in rainy conditions you ll notice that the rear window wiper only seems to clear about half  the driver s side  of the window  While I personally didn t have any problems with my 96 model  my sister had some of the renowned Windstar problems with her 95 model  head gasket  electrical  and has vowed never to purchase another Ford  However  from the group of people I know she is the only one to have serious problems with the Windstar  Chrysler and GM have had there own share of problems  mainly transmission related with their minivans  If you are in the market for a Minivan and Safety and Comfort are a priority I d highly recommend that you test drive the Windstar  I think you ll agree that it compares quite nicely to its competitors br br  
Pos, We bought our new 2000 Ford Windstar last October and have been extremely happy with our purchase so far  There have been no mechanical problems at all Here are some of the features that we like best about our Windstar It drives much more like a car than a van  It doesn t have that top heavy  awkward van feeling to it on corners  We were also impressed with the amount of pep the engine has  While it s not a Porsche  it does have very impressive acceleration for a van   much more similar to a car again than to other vans I have driven On the back of the back seat there are these great little hooks that you can use to hook grocery bags onto when you go shopping  This seems like a small feature  but we really love it  You no longer have to worry about the ice cream falling onto it s side and leaking  and you never have to repack your bags with all the items that spilled out during the drive home The idea of removable seats is great  We often take them out when we go camping and put a mattress in the back  It makes for an extremely comfortable sleep  The only thing that would be better would be if they could make the seats lighter  You need to be fairly muscular to take out the single seats  we took the four bucket seats in the first two rows and the bench at the back option  while the bench seat at the back is really a two person job to remove and reinstall Having the sliding doors on both sides is a very helpful feature that allows you to easily access just about anywhere in the vehicle  We used ours to move across the country  and found it very helpful in packing and accessing our belongings once they were packed in We were quite impressed with the stereo system  Before hearing it  we had discussed having a better system installed  but once we had our first listen  we decided we d keep the factory installed model The climate control system is quite good for the people in the front two seats  From a cold start it heats up or provides air conditioning very quickly  however there are no air vents to provide circulation to passengers in the back  A couple of times now when we ve had a full load of people  we have either had to bake or freeze in the front to keep our passengers in the back comfortable  I m not sure if there was an option to have rear climate controls  but if there is it will be something we will think about getting next time  We don t often have many passengers  so it hasn t been too big of a problem for us  but if you frequently carry a full load of passengers  it s something you might really want to think about  I should add that there are two windows at the back that open slightly to help with air circulation  which is great for your passengers when it s hot and you don t want to use air conditioning  The tinted windows that we opted for help with this too Finally  if you like to bring beverages in the car with you  there are more cupholders in the van than you would believe  
Pos, We recently traded in our 1996 Dodge Caravan for a 2000 Ford Windstar  We had had the Caravan for three years  and I was very happy with it  so when it came time to make the change  I was a little leary  However  I found that the Windstar had almost all the features that I had had in the Caravan  When I found out that the Windstar had a five star safety rating  I was convinced  The first time I drove our new Windstar  I was amazed at the amount of power it had  Our Caravan had always been rather sluggish when pulling out of our driveway and onto our uphill street  But the Windstar took right off  I ve been guilty of giving it too much gas many times  because I expect it to need the extra push  It doesn t  One of the most important features to me  especially with getting three kids in and out  is the sliding door on the driver side  I was so glad to hear that the new Windstars had this  It makes it so much easier getting small children and packages in and out  without having to climb all the way inside  Plus  I feel much safer  knowing that if we were in an accident  there would be better accessibility to my children  The Windstar is also a much heavier vehicle  It does not get swayed by the wind nearly as much as the Caravan  I feel that it would hold up in a collision much better than the Caravan  I feel much safer driving the Windstar  knowing that it has a good safety rating  I have three children of my own  and always have my friends  children in the car as well  so safety is extremely important to me  The only thing missing from our new Windstar is the built in child restraints in the middle seat  I don t use them for my own children  but it is handy to have when extra kids are in the car unexpectedly  These are available in the Windstar  but we did not want to add the cost of having them installed  Our new Windstar is a beautiful vehicle  It is practical and safe  I would recommend it to anyone br br  
Pos, Being a young  single person  such as myself  there is not much of a need for a minivan  but I checked it out nonetheless  Aesthetically  it has the same look and feel of other minivans  but with a significant advantage  Upon getting into the minvan  you first notice the room   no more cramped legs up front or in the rear  with plenty of room to add accessories  such as a console for beverages cd s tapes etc  Space aside  the seats also have a great deal of maneuvering power  so it is definitely possible to achieve that comfortable position you had in the last car  Another plus is the rear sliding door  as there is one on either side of the minivan  No more line ups to get inside the van Once the seat is adjusted and you turn the engine on  surprise  a nice  healthy engine with no obtrusive noises  After you hit the gas pedal and start driving  you notice the immense power this vehicle has   it is so smooth and able to achieve your desired speed rather quickly  It s almost like driving a car  When driving uphill  you never fell the need to  quot floor quot  it  just to be able to drive above 2 miles an hour When you see the light ahead about to turn red and get ready to hit the brakes  the Windstar brakes so effortlessly  coming to a complete stop exactly where you want to stop  Even for those sudden slam on the brakes moments  you will notice that this vehicle does not at all jerk you forward  It adjusts were well to abrupt and harsh driving conditions The only downside is inside the minivan  Parents may notice that the rear window latches are a little on the clumsy side  and have the potential to result in jammed little fingers While this isn t necessarily the most affordable minivan  it is a good complete package  boasting a modern appearance and a good ride  making this a very good choice for people who need the roominess of a minivan  but don t like traditional minivans br br  
Pos, We ve had our 2000 Windstar SEL since July 2000  It s a much nicer  more refined vehicle than our previous Chevrolet Astro and Plymouth Voyager  Here are the things we like best about our Windstar  The ride is very comfortable  The interior is very comfortable  The controls are laid out logically  the rear ventilation system works great  the seats are relatively comfortable  and the power side doors work perfectly  The styling is gorgeous  Even though the Windstar design is getting a little old  it s still the most distinctive  beautiful minivan on the road  Safety  Five stars  Front and side airbags  Reverse sensing system  Anti lock brakes  Traction control  Conveniences  like cup holders  rear passenger ventilation system controls  power side doors  and the entertainment system  They all work great Concerns  Long term reliability  So far  we ve had the van into the dealer for 3 minor recall issues  replacement of the intake manifold  replacement of the front disc brake rotors  and replacement of a front seat belt buckle to repair the malfunctioning seat belt warning system  These are relatively minor issues  but I am concerned about long term reliability because we plan on keeping this van for many years  Leg room for rear seat passengers is extremely limited  Our sons are 15 and 12 and sometimes groan when they re relegated to the back seat As I said  this is our third minivan  Our kids are 8  12  and 15 and we ve worn out a Chevy Astro and Plymouth Grand Voyager through the years  By far  the Windstar is the most comfortable  user friendly minivan we ve owned  It s holding up well to kid abuse and the normal wear and tear of daily life  The reliability issues concern us a little  but it looks like we have the bugs worked out now  We re looking forward to many years with our Windstar  It s too bad  however  that this will likely be our last minivan  By the time we wear this one out  our 2 older kids will be off to college and all we ll need is a car  That ll be a switch I d recommend the Windstar to anyone  It s relatively spacious  comfortable  safe  fun to drive  and a good value  
Pos, First I ll say this  The 1995  and  to some extent  the 96  Windstar SUCKED  reliability wise  The 95 model was the first model year  so it s sort of understandable  The 95 year had transmission problems and all sorts HOWEVER  The new vans are GREAT Several people I know have Windstars of various vintages  96  97  98  2000  Only the guy with the 96 has had problems My family has rented 3 Windstars  a 95  98  and 99  each for over a month  We used them for long drives  we went two days constantly on the highway and also around town  We ve been completely impressed with all of them  The interior is humungous  Every time we rented a Windstar  it was used to haul 6 people and luggage on long trips  No problem  Still comfy for everyone in the van  The only complaint was with the 1995 model   the air conditioning wasn t very good in the back bench  However  this was completely fixed in the 98 and 99 models we rented All the vans were very comfortable  and the sound systems were excellent  important if you are on long trips  They all had the 3 8L V6 and drove nicely  especially the 99  Absolutely nothing went wrong with any of them  including the 1995  and we were so impressed that we nearly bought one  we decided on a Focus  because we don t really  need  the extra space I highly reccommend the Ford Windstar  but only models from 1997 and on  This is the van for families Tips  Don t get a Windstar without the 3 8L V6 engine  The extra power is very nice  and the engine is smoother br br  
Pos, We have had 2 Ford Windstars in the past 4 years  But we didn t trade in because of any problems  We traded it in to get a newer model and we are not sorry  We love our Windstar  The ride is superb and quiet  It is so comfortable to travel in  We ve been to Niagara Falls  Canada  Toronto and Montreal also  And we ve also done closer trips to Vermont  New Hampshire  Rhode Island  We are from Massachusetts  I have never had any problems to speak of with these vans and love the dependability of them  There s plenty of room for a family and cargo too  The seats are very comfortable  I happen to like Fords anyway  Haven t had any complaints in the 29 years we ve had them in our family  So I have good reason to stay with them  Our van also has the automatic sliding door in the right rear  We especially love that convenience  When you re bogged down with tons of shopping bags from a shopping day at the mall you really appreciate this feature  
Pos, We did extensive research and drove every mini van in town  This is the fifth mini van that we have owned  but the first Ford  We love the car  The built in TV and VCR are wonderful for the kids  The car rides beautifully  has lots of room  nice features  and is generally a perfect car  So far   3 months  we haven t found anything about this car that we do not like  It even gets better mileage than was advertised  We recommend this car with no reservations  For the first time  we have chosen to lease  and this is also a good experience  We plan to get another Windstar in 2 years  and our lease payment is only  350 per month br br  
Pos, I bought my Bronco in 1999  It was an  89 XLT with only 84 000 miles on the clock  and it showed  The 89  is the same as the  90  which is why I posted it here  I bought this vehicle because I was moving to Northern Iowa and I had a 2WD 1986 GMC Sierra Classic with 160 000 on the clock  and needed something new for Iowa s winter weather  This Bronco was a one owner and I paid a fairly reasonable price for it  People who don t know much about truck models think it is new  There is plenty of interior space  and seats 5 very comfortably  No one has to ask me to move my seat up  It has a 302 V 8 which is plenty of power for this vehicle  The previous owner towed his RV with this rig  I have actually tried to get this tank stuck and had difficulty at doing so with the 33 quot  tires it is equipped with right now  As a previously stated  this Bronco is a tank  It is 11 years old and runs great  sounds great  and looks great  One thing Broncos tend to do is wander when traveling in a straight line  It is not recommended for people who will only drive it around town  Elderly people and or people wearing skirts  dresses  or high heels may have trouble climbing in this vehicle  You must also be prepared to get 13 18 MPG  and even lower in four wheel drive  The Bronco is great for someone who needs a dependable  powerful  and comfortable four wheel drive vehicle at a reasonable price     
Pos, I have already written an epinion about a 1992 Ford Ranger that I used to own  but last week I traded it in for a 1998 model  This time I decided to go with the off road package which gave me the 4 0 liter V6 I love the power  A few nice emenities are a center counsel  five speed tranny  larger wheels and tires  and a hard tonneau cover  As for how it rides  it s pretty smooth  much better than I had expected out of a truck with an off road package  I also like the fact I sit higher than most other traffic  that is except for the onslaught of Suburbans and Expeditions  I am pretty comfortable driving this truck  it s a little cramped but tolerable  I m about average height  6 feet  so my legs are bent a little bit but it s not like my knees are rubbing on the steering wheel or anything  I don t think I can say enough about the acceleration and towing power of this truck I love it  After driving the standard 2 3L Ranger for awhile it sure is nice to have a little something behind the gas pedal again  Just to test it I tried towing my dad s car trailer  with my mom s Bravada on it  to see how it did and it handled it with no problem  Now I can t wait for summer to take the boat or jet skis out  One draw back to the extra power is the extra cost of gas  I don t think this is all directly due to the larger displacement though  now that I have a little power I m putting my foot in it a lot more as well  but on the highway it s getting right around 20 22 mpg br br  
Pos, I give this truck a definite thumbs up  It is affordable and good looking  The Ford Rangers have come a long way since they first were introduced  This pickup truck has taken me where I wanted to go  and for a reasonable amount of money  There is nothing in this world that could compare to getting in my truck and taking it wherever I want to  It goes when you want it to  That s why I chose this truck  Although it is a challenge in the snow  I find that the good far more than outweighs the bad  It is comfortable  but could use a little extra leg room if you ask me  To drive this vehicle feels  secure  It s a safe vehicle  and knowing that makes it much easier  and more fun to drive  For someone who is looking for a powerful  safe  rugged midsize pickup  this is the truck I  personally  would suggest checking out br br  
Pos, When I set out to purchase a new auto  I did not really give the Explorer that much consideration  But  now  after owning it for just over a year  I can say that I am truly pleased with it  I was impressed with how much you can tow  the pulling power of the engine  and the stereo is not too shabby In my occupation I am sometimes required to bring a lot of gear with me and I kind of wish that the cargo area was bigger  but  the Explorer is still larger that Chevy  I think that while driving at a high rate of speed on the highway  the exterior sound is too great to enjoy the stereo  I wish Ford did a little bit more to make the auto more to insulate the exterior noise  In my occupation I am sometimes required to bring a lot of gear with me and I kind of wish that the cargo area was bigger  but  the Explorer is still larger that Chevy  I think that while driving at a high rate of speed on the highway  the exterior sound is too great to enjoy the stereo  I wish Ford did a little bit more to make the auto a little bit more to insulate the exterior noise  Oh ya  last night while driving to work  I got a flat  I think that engineer who designed the tire changing system  never had to USE this system  It was a real pain I think that I like SUV s more simply because sitting at a higher elevation  you get to see more of the road and it gives you time to mentally digest more information in a timely manner  When I was a truck driver  this is one thing that I found to be of particular value when driving long hauls  I like the seats  they have found to be comfortable on long or short drives  I think that the side step bars or great for my wife  who is a little vertically challenged  My kid uses them as well to climb up and out of the auto  Pleased I got it overall  
Pos, My wife and I bought a 2000 F250 crewcab a little over a week ago  Everything we wanted was not on the vehicle  but it was a good compromise  Our intended uses for this truck include hauling our cattle to market  farm chores  and occasionally hauling the family around two adults three teenagers and one younger  We sat the kids in an extended cab to check legroom and found that size coming up short  When I drive  I don t care for kids knees in my back  Once we had decided on the vehicle size that fit us  we realized only Ford made a well equipped truck that large  We looked at the Ford commercial pamphlet and decided for long life the 6 8 liter V10 and heavy duty automatic transmission would be able to perform the tasks we were buying the truck for  It is a stout engine  and has torque that becomes available at a lower r p m  than the Chevy 6000 V8  Driving home and subsequently  I have found the Ford to be quiet  with a high quality ride more at home on a car than a truck  We have driven bumpy roads to test the ride quality as well as the ability of the cd player to withstand bumps without skipping  and it passed  The power trailer mirrors are great and the amount of glass in the body lets you see forever almost  The gas mileage is about normal for a truck  perhaps slightly better than I had thought for a large engine I enjoy driving this truck  it is comfortable and not bouncy  I put a half ton of feed in the back and didn t notice any difference  I would have liked the captains chairs and a different color  but I am happy with the purchase and it looks like it will last for years   
Pos, we have now had our v10 F250 for 2 years we bought one of the first 2000 s back in October 1999  The truck has an automatic and the v10 engine having 310bhp and around 450ft lb torque  Its a pulling monster  We have the truck set up with 3 73 rear gears it is not a four wheel drive  We pull a 19 foot boat weighing in with trailer gas and all of us at about 4500 lbs  The truck still runs like there is no weight behind it  gas mileage drops from about 15 to 16 to around 12 to 14 depending on speed we have found that about 65 is the best speed to gas mileage ratio  The interior of the truck is wonderful it is a xlt with all options  It has a cd player which could be better  The air is ice cold and the heater blows out air hot enough to burn you  It relativley quiet inside the main thing you hear is the ten cylinders in front of you working  Room in the back is exceptional  Room in the front is more then anyone would ever need  We have taken the truck on many vacations and it has gotten about 17 miles to the gallon then not to bad for a 6 8L engine  With a roll top cover the bed is virtually waterproof and lockable  
Pos, Hot rod trucks are not a new form of radical transportation by any means  however Ford really is on the proverbial  ball  when it comes to this one  Add an intercooled supercharger to Ford s already potent Triton 5 4 liter overhead cam V8 engine  then drop it into a lowered F 150 with a dramatically stiffened suspension and huge disc brakes  and voila  you have the worlds coolest hot rod production truck  not to mention  at the time  the fastest i Driving Impressions i   A ny full sized pickup truck gives you that sense of power   most notably the 2002 Dodge Rams  towering over small passenger cars  In the case of the 1999 F 150 Lightning though  the feeling is enhanced  With 360 horsepower at your right foot coupled to a silky smooth 4 speed automatic transmission don t expect a boring ride  In terms of  acceleration   the 1999 Ford F 150 Lightning is astonishing  ripping 0 60 in under 6 seconds and to 100 mph in an estimated 15 2 seconds  according to many specs  Unlike most trucks where weight and poor aerodynamics come into play at around 80 or so MPH  the Lightning pulls far past that  Add flat  neutral cornering with excellent grip  responsive steering  and very supportive seats  and the mixture is just about perfect for a hot rod show truck   SVT    special vehicles team  selected the 5 4 liter Triton V8 offered in the F 150 and Expedition as the powerplant for the 1999 Lightning  Very good idea if you ask me  The 4 6 found in the Mustangs would have lacked Torque and power if they would have selected that particular engine  The Trition was conceived primarily to deliver a lot of low rev torque  440lb  ft  3 000 RPM  with a smaller bore than stroke of  3 60  x 4 22  Realizing that the Lightning buyers would want substantially more horsepower  some significant changes were made over its predecessor and its lesser models  The main power increase came by way of an intercooled Eaton Series II supercharger  also found the Jaguar XJR  The V8 got a special forged steel crankshaft  sinter forged alloy rods  and special dished alloy 8 4 1 compression pistons  A Larger 2 28  dual bore throttle body was also installed   Suspension b  The basic ladder type separate frame as used on all F 150s is retained for the Lightning  as is the basic suspension  short long arms up front and a leaf sprung live axle out back  Modifications include a lower height  recalibrated springs  modified shocks  thicker anti roll bars  and some massive  four wheel vented disc brakes i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  of the F 150 Lightning is very much like the regular F 150s  All Lightnings comes with split bench seats with center arm rests and storage bins  The steering wheel is thick and meaty  The stereo system in my test truck was not stock  it was a 6 speaker Alpine system  but from what I hear they came with  excellent sounding  stock sound systems  The gauge s are white  giving you that sporty feel while looking at your speedometer rise   same gauges that are in the SVT Mustang  These gauge s can be found in a number of Ford performance automobiles  There is plenty of room for 3 adults  and the seats are very supportive  and comfortable to boot  Like the regular F 150s for  99 model year  the Lightning is very  car like  in configuration  The drivers position is especially good allowing for easy access to the HVAC controls and all of the gadgetry in the cabin i Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior   while not as bold as the 2002 Dodge Ram or any current generation Dodge Ram  is much more bold than the regular F 150s  There is no confusing a F 150 Lightning with a regular F 150  or any truck on this planet for that matter  The F 150 Lightning comes with side exhaust  a very cool feature  would have been better if it had dual side exhaust  A SVT badge of honor in the rear  Huge 18  rims matched with high performance tires  and an aggressive nose lets other drivers know this is one serious truck  All Ford Lightnings get the practical and convenient opening rear window  Red  black  or white  in all three of the available colors  the F 150 lightning radiates real aggression and style with its lowered stance and sexy five spoke alloy rims  and body extensions  Because of how collectible these trucks are  the  price  is actually higher then what they were back in 1999  I have seen F 150 Lightnings go for around  40 000  New  these trucks had a MSRP of around  30 000 even i Conclusion i While most owners will not utilize the power provided in the Lightning  the Ford Lightning offers amazing performance attributes  This vehicle may not be the best for off road use  in fact off road use is best avoided  however this type of a truck is one that will turn heads and burn rubber  fair enough trade off  The Lightning is recommended 100  to anyone looking for an exclusive  non off road  hot rod production truck Looking to read about another truck  You may want to check out    a href

Pos, I utilize a F 150 XL Model through work  It s a base model featuring a 5 Speed  Titan V 8 and a tape deck  This truck is abused  Numerous people drive it for deliveries  getting supplies  and weekend use  There is no doubt in my mind it takes a beating  I have to say it s durability has impressed me  Our truck is approaching 40K in mileage and the only work required has been regular maintenance and self induced  The later primarily refers to several flat tires  a broken front grill  someone bumped on of our bigger trucks  and a sheared off Lug on the right rear wheel  You can see what I mean about abuse  However  the drive train remains quite solid  Considering the base model  and I drive it in workboots  the thing picks up quite good  and breaks loose quite easy  Rain is the biggest enemy  as with most trucks  That big V 8 will break the wheels loose quickly and efficiently  The ride is comfortable considering it s work status  It equipped with a basic cloth benchseat  I ve made several day long runs in it and it could be more comfortable  but it could be a lot worse  The lack of cruise control is a bigger factor to me than the seats  The bed is sized to hold most of what we need  The tailgate easily disconnects if necessary  nice feature  This truck has an excellent utility aspect  and I would recommend it to any fleet or local shop  However  if your shopping for a personal truck  I would recommend a better equipped model  The build quality is certain to be the same  but you don t want that bench seat br br  
Pos, Late in the summer of 1999  my husband and daughter were in an accident that left our 1993 Chevrolet Lumina minivan totaled  We spent the next month searching for a replacement  When buying a new vehicle  my husband and I have different priorities  My concern is generally limited to the passenger area and comfort  while he is concerned about what is under the hood  We both have been very pleased with the minivan we chose  a 1999 Ford Windstar  After test driving many new and used minivans  the first thing I noticed when I got into the Windstar was how well built and sturdy it felt  It handled well  and was very comfortable  I liked how the instrument panel was designed   everything was easy to find  and clearly labeled  I was also impressed with the amount of space there was  both leg room and hauling space  The rear bench seat can be moved to the center  allowing even more space in back  I also noticed the arm rest by the window  A person in the front seat doesn t need the window down to rest their arm as if it were  Every seating position was comfortable  and the upholstery and door design were very pleasing to the eye  Having the second sliding door is something we wanted  as was keyless entry  No more fumbling for keys in the rain  The Windstar had everything we wanted  and two hours later it was ours  I realize that engine power and size are important  and my husband is very pleased with that aspect of our new van  Of course  safety played an important part of our decision  and the Windstar consistently ranks among the safest  If you want comfort along with reliability in a minivan  I highly recommend the Ford Windstar     
Pos, Everyone who knows something about cars  and or anything about the Ford Windstar then they know it is a very praised van  5 star crash test rating  what could be more important  numerous awards  and more  This is arguably the most popular mini van on the market  for good reason I ve owned a Ford Winstar for about a year and a half now and have had no real problems to date  This is a very reliable car  not to mention its performance  This car still has that new car feel when you first test drive it  it is very smooth running  Another thing that is great about the Ford Windstar  is that IT IS A FORD  What car company has the experience that Ford does  With Ford you know that you are getting a good quality automobile that will last you for many years to come  For instance  my father just sold his 1988 Ford F 150  which was in perfect condition from the inside  the body was somewhat rusted  and it turned out to be a bargain from the price he paid for it to last him 12 years with very minimal visits to the shop Back to the Windstar itself  If you have a large family  or even a small one  you cannot go wrong with this car  Just by looking at you can tell it has  quot family car quot  written all over it  It s perfect to take the kids on long trips and the car is very versatile  All in all the Ford Windstar is a great car that you and your family will enjoy for a long while br br  
Pos, Ford is making it very easy to find a Windstar that fits you  First  its only real competition this model year is the new Honda Odyssey and good luck finding one of those  Second  Ford Credit is willing to throw free money at buyers who rate it  Third  the Windstar can be dressed up in about any configuration imaginable Unless you are buying for some institution you ll skip the base and deal with the LX  which comes with the second sliding door  Next  you ll scratch your head trying to figure out what the difference is between the LX and SE models  All the same equipment is available on each  so sooner or later your salesman will have to breakdown and confess the only difference is the chrome trim which mars  IMHO  the SE s grille and sides It looks like the chrome tape you can buy at Pep Boys  but evidently some segment of Ford s market research showed anything over 25Gs has to have chrome  Next you ll wonder why anybody in their right mind would pop for a top of the line SEL  with the garish two tone paint and three spoke wheels which actually look LESS luxurious than the down market Windstar alloys  The SEL also harbors Ford s hyped but likely high nuisance factor rear sensor array  which is supposed to tell you when you are about to back into something but I bet sounds every time a cat swooshes past If this sounds like a big gold star for the LX  you get a gold star  It can be loaded up with nearly every available option  including a rear passenger stereo set up which has to be the envy of Honda  traction control  quad seating  etc The drive train for all models is solid  if unspectacular  The 200hp V 6 moves the machine nicely at highway speeds  providing for effortless cruising and passing  But hey it is a mini van and not a dragster  even though the copious amounts of torque in the low end can come on quick  providing a less car like ride than the Odyssey or say  the Sienna  As dealers are getting rid of Windstars pretty fast  and pocketing the several hundred dollars in factory holdback in the process  it shouldn t be too hard to come in with a price at or slightly above invoice  Couple that with the aforementioned special financing and anyone in the market for a people mover needs to check it out br br  
Pos, I live in the Netherlands Europe and bought a new Ford Windstar SEL  which comes  unfortunately  with a 3 0 ltr engine in the Netherlands only  We  a family of 6  like to go on holidays on long trips like driving to Spain or Southern France  occasionally with a trailer caravan When I was in a hurry to get home I drove about 1000 miles from Spain to Netherlands in a consecutive night and day  with hardly a pause Under such circumstances you really value the Windstar as a family limo  5 people are just sleeping and I am driving  with comfortable seating  music on a headphone   fan to keep you awake  and the small inside rearview mirror to watch over your family  in the meantime dragging a fully loaded caravan mobilehome through the rolling hills I have driven Mercedes  Volvo  Audi  Buick and other good cars  but like this one most cause driving it doesn t tire you The only thing I don t like is that models exist with a bigger engine and I don t have it  even at a gasoline price of 5 dollar a gallon and that car probably costing as much as   50 000 over here If Ford starts to export 3 8 ltr models to Europe  that will probably be my next one  next year or so One other thing is the remote sensor  In European cities you don t have much parking space  but with this reverse sensor  you can park it anywhere with great pleasure and people watching and admiring you for your craftmanship Of course this car also had minor drawbacks sofar  like electric side doors not closing without some help every once in a year and plastic details just falling of but hey nothing is perfect and a Ford isn t a Ford with some less significant loose parts easy to be clicked back  Auto Detroit is French for selfdestruct Also the seat configuration is hard to change  with some European cars like Renault or Opel you need only to point to a seat to remove but in Windstar it is real work One more important positive part  my wife doesn t like to drive big cars in general  but really loves this one  
Pos, Wehn my parents were looking for a new car they were especially interested in a van  Only problem was that they didnt know which one  Whether it be a Quest  Sienna  Caravan  or Windstar  First  we were interested in the Sienna but they were very hard to find available and they are a heck of a lot of money  Then we came across the Windstar  What a van  it was very spacious and we got it at a great deal  In the front seat there is an unbelievable amount of leg room  And don t worry about the back seats plenty of room for any sized person  I recommened to get bucket seats in the middle seating area  Much more attractive and private like for the riders  The seating is very comfortable and the remote door feature is an ideal one for youngsters and elders  C mon think about it  you know how heavy a Van door is  Right  Well all you have to do is press onw button and it is opened for you  I also recommend that you select the option of no middle console because the van is much more spacious without  And you really dont need it because there is a big bucket type drawer on the fron console  The trunk of the van is also unbelievably huge  I couldn t believe it when i saw it  So take my advice and go look at a Ford Windstar br br  
Pos, My wife and I own a 99 WINDSTAR that we bought in Feb 99 and we have had no problems with it at all  WE HAD A 97 AND HAVE LEASED FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS FROM FOR WITH ONLY A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS OVER THE LAST 5 YEARS WITH 3 DIFFERENT VAN S  WHEN WE DID HAVE A PROBLEM FORD FIXED IT THE FIRST TIME IS WAS IN THE SHOP  WE WOULD BUY ANOTHER ONE WHEN THIS LEASE IS UP  THE RIDE IS GREAT AND IS VERY COMFORTABLE  SHE REALLY LIKES TWO SIDE DOORS AND WITH A SET OF TWINS AND TWO OLDER KIDS ITS EASY TO GET IN AND OUT  WE HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL TRIPS AND HAS A LOT OF ROOM br br  
Pos, I have a Ford Windstar LX 99  It is so comfortable  quiet and spacious  The redesign of this car was a complete success  it is larger with more available amenities and the option of a much more powerful engine 3 8L V6  The addition of a second sliding door makes the all new Ford Windstar a very good choice in your Minivan  In the van I felt very safe knowing that is got quadrouple five star safety ratings very high marks It is the most comfortable  quiet and spacious minivan I have ever been in  and I was only in the LX model  It is priced right at about  20 000 to start and boy  it is well worth it I had an early nineties sedan that was much less manuverable than this van and it is three times the size br br  
Pos, I purchased my new Windstar in August of 1999 from Bankston Ford in Frisco  Texas  I would recommend this vehicle to my best friend  Ford continues to put out the highest quality cars and trucks on the road  The Windstars safety record speaks for itself  My insurance went down  15 a month when I purchased it  trading in my 95 Dodge Van  My insurance agent was as happy as can be because the van comes factory equipped with a passive anti theft system  The ride is great  there is lots of room for my family and the gear that comes with two kids LOTS  If I had to do it all over again I would buy the exact same vehicle 10 times out of 10 If you are in the market for a van that the whole family will love  Ford has the van for you  I have the Windstar LX which is the middle of the line as far as accessories go and highly recommend it  The gas mileage is great for this big of a vehicle also  Go buy one and you will love it too br br  
Pos, When we bought this van we had an Aerostar for almost 5 years and loved it  It was very reliable and lots of fun to drive  It was also one of the safest vehicles on the road at the time Last year  99  we bought the new model Windstar  It was like a dream car  it is so pretty and rides really well  It sits all five of us comfortable and if there are a couple extra people with us they are fine also My father in law mentioned it rides like a caddy and it does  Handles well and everything The gas mileage is good and it has taken very little to maintain it It has the highest safety ratings of all cars and this was a huge selling point for us  comfortable and safe  Both my husband and I were in an awful accident in Italy and don t want to take any chances again  Well  now what I don t like is this  A  It has an engine knock that has been checked over and the dealer said that there isn t a knock  It must be the cheap gas  well we upgraded to a name brand and the knock is worse We also have been having problems with the transmission slipping  again we were told they couldn t duplicate the problem  This isn t as bad as it was but is still there  The engine knock is bad from time to time  was so bad the other day that it was hard to accelerate We are leasing and in 2 years our lease will be up and we will have to decide whether to buy this van or go on to another vehicle  If the problems are not fixed  you know where we are going  To another dealer br br  
Pos, If they did  they probably wouldn t be millionaires  No one in their right mind should have to pay  2000 to  3000 above MSRP  like some dealers are charging for the 2002 Odyssey  In fact I looked at a used 2000 Odyssey in my area with 40K that was  27 000 So I purchased a very clean used 99 Ford Windstar SE with 32K for  14000  My second child will be here in a couple of months so I reluctantly had to make the big break from a car to a minivan Would I have liked a Honda Odyssey or Mazda MPV  Yes Could I have afforded a Honda Odyssey or Mazda MPV  Yes Do I want to afford a Honda Odyssey or Mazda MPV  NO It was a simple question of value  Getting something that works for not much money  Let s face it  The majority of Post 1980 s vehicles are ALL much more reliable than they used to be  Ford  Chrysler  GM  etc  A hundred thousand miles is nothing these days  250K is a more realistic goal now  You don t need a Honda or Toyota to achieve that anymore Furthermore I ve owned three Hondas  Two Accords and one Civic  They are not without their  glitches  And regular maintenance costs  mufflers  brakes  any other parts you may need  are roughly twice the price of parts for domestic vehicles  The newer Hondas and Toyotas may be made in USA  but usually the parts are made overseas and are subject to import tariffs  Also a trademark of all my Hondas was a hard  uncomfortable seat  and a harsh ride  that would be  a good feel of the road  and  stiff handling  to the Honda fans  I drive 400  miles frequently with maybe one stop for gas  It became almost unbearable with a Honda seat  sometimes I would be saddle sore the next day  Seats may seem like small things to consider  but your hiney has a major interaction with your vehicle Most models of the Windstar have the features you most need  as do most of the minivans out there that aren t the absolute base model  It has comfortable seats  a comfortable  quiet ride  and most of all it is a good value  The thing is going to run for a long time  and I didn t have to break the bank to get one  Not only can I haul my kids with the Windstar  I have money left over to put a little away for their college fund If it needs a few repairs  so be it  The extra 13 Grand I would ve had to spend on a similarly used Honda will go a long way to any would be repairs  
Pos, As a former employee of Ford  I found the Aspire as a wonderfully refreshing replacement to the Festiva  My first Festiva went about 18 000 miles before the rings came unseated  and blew the oil out The Aspire engineers have cured this problem  and I have the only GT Aspire that I know of  I was with Ford for 22 years  and can do just about anything that can be done to a car  mechanically speaking The Aspire has the 59 HP Festiva engine  otherwise known as a Mazda 121 Cosmo engine  and is set up to run on fuel that is subgrade to US unleaded  I decided to try an old trick of boring out the throttle body to increase the airflow through the engine  and got a little more than I asked for  The dyno gives me 64 HP with a decent highway mileage figure of 38 MPG  Therefore I stuck some  quot GT quot  logos on the lower front fenders  and added the FACTORY spoiler on the top of the rear deck The take off from redlights is a little bit better  but if you were looking for tire burners  get a Mustang  The Aspire is a great little car  equivalent with the Bug of the 60 s and 70 s  but with real seatbelts and airbags to boot  I have the intent to drive this car for a least 200 000 miles on the first engine and will periodically report the performance and cost of maintenance to  quot Little Red quot If you have any quirks to comment on  I m open for discussion I will try to share what I have learned from the parts books and mechanics  I have picked up a lot of info this way br br  
Pos,  I bought another  used 1999  Crown Vic with the insurance settlement after my first  a used 1997  was totaled  The car was T boned at the front quarter panel by a driver on drugs  who plowed a  78 Trans Am at 50 mph through a stop sign  The air bags did deploy  See http www stormeyes org tornado nt000117 jpg for details p Though the car was knocked well off the roadway and totaled  my family and I escaped with only scrapes  scratches and a minor concussion  from the air bag impact  That was a high speed  side impact collision  folks  more than testament enough to the safety of this car  Its use in police and taxi fleets was convincing enough already regarding the Crown Vic s durability  but now  as long as Ford makes the Crown Vic with body on frame construction  I will not buy another make and model p The vehicle is a little over four years old as of this writing  and I have used it very heavily  101 000 miles of mainly highway driving in sometimes dreadful conditions  I am a storm chaser  and have equipped the car with a custom electronics rack that holds equipment very steady in such a stable  smooth riding vehicle   This car has been through severe wind  sand storms  large hail  day after day of 100 degree heat  subzero temperatures  deep mud  blizzards  and once  standing muddy water higher than the door bottoms  all with no mechanical breakdowns or major problems  It just passed its first tune up with flying colors   I cannot imagine a more comfortable car in which to travel hundreds upon hundreds of miles per day  Its top caliber suspension makes even notoriously rough Oklahoma and South Dakota back roads tolerable  and on a smooth interstate  it s hard to tell from feel alone that the car is moving at all  The Crown Vic has an SUV s weight  but with a far lower center of gravity   making it amazingly stable in intense crosswind  It also is 5 10 mpg more fuel efficient than most medium to large SUVs  Unless one  needs and frequently uses  4WD  who does  really  a used  late model Crown Vic should be given strong consideration as a primary family car p There is no more spacious trunk in the world of sedans  My friend  jokingly  suggested I could stuff six bodies in there with room to spare  Seriously  I have a Gall s police trunk organizer in the bottom  and there still is room for a long vacation s worth of luggage for a family of four plus groceries  Although towing  officially  is passe  I pull a 17 ft Bass Tracker with no problems   There are some minor problems which I can tolerate for the sake of room and safety  The LX models  which I have had  could use more power  My car just cannot accelerate up hills very well  Fortunately there is an option here that doesn t involve expensive retrofitting  Used car buyers should consider Crown Vic Interceptors equipped with the police package  dual exhaust  for best results  Also  my paint on the doors and front panels began to chip and peel in small spots at around 80 000 miles  revealing the white primer beneath  Maybe that is related to the extreme conditions I have driven it through  but a truly well done paint job should endure far worse for far longer  
Pos, For those of you who were born after the 70s  or were not old enough to drive then  you missed something special  That was the experience of owning and driving one of Detroit s huge old style luxury cars  Though each manufacturer had its own fleet of flagships  all of those cars had one thing in common  Luxury  And it was luxury that you just can t find today in any American car  because nothing else is like owning the sheer mass of a 70s American luxury car  The 1974 Ford LTD was a fine example of this departed breed  Mine was a two door coupe with a landau top  despite the car s huge dimensions  the styling gave it almost a rakish appearance  Being manufactured nearly 30 years ago  natural resources weren t in such scarce supply  either  thus the rich appearance of the chrome grill and bumpers  I find these vastly preferable to the plastic creations of today  Mass was another thing this car has in abundance  the two door model weighed over 5 000 pounds  Besides being almost completely invulnerable in a collision with another car  its huge cast iron V 8 made it nearly impervious to overheating in the summer  In fact  there were several times during my ownership that the radiator failed completely  yet I drove for miles without knowing the cooling system had broken down  simply because the car didn t overheat  Ride quality was fantastic  nothing upset this car s poise  not bumps  railroad tracks  potholes  or debris  Driving on the expressway at speed was like floating in complete isolation of the road  The interior was dead quiet  no wind or road noise  no rattles  squeaks  groans  or vibration  That only enhanced listening to the stereo  you didn t have to turn it up to overpower road noise to the point that the sound was distorted  Whatever your pleasure  be it hard rock or string symphony  you could relax and listen to it at a comfortable sound level  Interior room simply has no comparison in a modern American car  unless you go to the truck like Suburban or its kin  Vast  airy  and expansive  six adults sit with room to spare  The old style bench seats give you every possible square inch of seating area  Likewise  the trunk is huge  easily swallowing a dozen or more bags of groceries  plus two spare tires  or enough luggage for a whole family  Naturally  a car this old has its quirks  though they weren t seen that way when it was built  because it had the technology of its day  and not the 21st century  The engine was nothing sophisticated  cast iron block  no computer parts or modules  and pre electronic ignition  Tune ups  and engine maintenance in general  are much more frequent than on a modern car  Can you handle tune ups every 10 000 miles  and oil changes every 2 000  You ll also pay for replacement parts that no longer exist on modern cars  and for servicing they don t need  Are you old enough to remember points and condensors  Did you have to take your first car in to have its joints lubricated every 3 000 miles  If not  you re going to learn something  Other aspects of the 1974 LTD may also require some deep thought before you buy  The model I had boasted a 351 cubic inch V 8  It was a smooth running engine but only had moderate horsepower  about 170  Cars were like that then  not like cars now which can give you 200 horsepower in a 200 cubic inch engine  The point  The car s power will do for everyday driving  including  emergency  passing  but you ll never burn any rubber  Fuel costs to run this car may seem preposterous  but remember it was built when regular unleaded sold for 43 cents a gallon  Suffice it to say that even with the smallest V 8  the 351  which was advertised as an  economy  engine then  you ll get about 10 miles per gallon city  and about 14 miles per gallon highway  And by the way  there s no fuel injection in this car  it s got a carburetor  Still  there s nothing like driving a car like this  with a hood that s long enough to be the prow of a yacht  and a cabin that s big enough to be the command room of a battleship  Such cars may never again be built by American industry  but this essay is in remembrance to the times in which they were  
Pos, We need to start with the model I own  The XLT with Appearance Package  Several of my comments relate to features found in this model  The premium sound system  not the Mach system  lacks low end bass  I fixed that with an add on sub  The good point being that the receiver is capable  it s just the amp that is lacking  The cargo area needs a net and some hooks to keep things in place  My biggest gripe is that the cargo area does not come with a cover and there is no aftermarket ones available  I fault Ford for not adding two little pieces of plastic into the sides that would have allowed me to add one  This is coming from someone who has had their vehicle broken into because of what was visible in the cargo area  I got the 5 4 V8 and it gets about 12 MPG  My comment here is don t kid yourself  if you don t like paying for gas  then this is not the vehicle for you  My particular model has some unique 17  factory rims  Something is not right because my wheels require balancing every 5000 miles  My tire place tells me that the wheels are designed so that it is hard for balancing weights to stay on  This is not normal but I like the distinct look of the wheels  The AWD system is not the best in the world producing noticeable slippage in snow  However  Ford compensated for this by adding in the unusual option of allowing a 4WD mode  The 4WD mode is superb in the white stuff  This being my 6th AWD 4WD vehicle  I prefer 4WD in snow  I refer you to the motto  Transfers power from the wheels that slip to the wheels that grip  The key point is that some slipping must be going on  When this is done well  see my epinion on the Subaru Outback  then you don t notice  in the Expedition s case  it is not done well  but the 4wd mode compensates  The 3rd row seat  while improved over previous years  is still a pain in the butt to get in and out  It is heavy and bulky and I always strain my back dealing with it  Yes  the manual says use two people  but I don t happen to have an official seat moving helper on staff at the moment  No normal feature of a car should require two people to use it  They tried to compensate by allowing the seat to be folded into a shelf or tilted up  Both of these features are nothing more than marketing  The tilted up seat does not provide that much more room  The folded down shelf is useless because anything placed on the self slides right off  The new line of GM full size SUVS seems to have dealt properly with this feature by allowing two separate seats  I tend to keep my seat removed and only put it back in when I have a lot of people to move  The vehicle definitely looks cooler with it out  Now on to the many  many good points Design Room  Room  Room  I am 6 4  and no part of this vehicle comes even close to any part of me  shoulders  head  etc  Good use of room  In checking out the wildly popular line of Chrysler minivans  I found roomy vehicles  but a lot of wasted room  Not so with the Expedition  The console is fantastic  the cup holders LARGE  and enough little storage areas to please a pack rat  I would ask for more storage in the cargo area though  If you ve done your research  you know that there is 4 feet between the wheel wells allowing for sheets of building materials  Everything seems to be solid  no thin plastic parts  check out the console on a Blazer for an example of cheap plastic parts  The steering wheel is large and cushioned and feels good in your hands  I really like the CD changer being accessible in the center console yet still having plenty of room left for stuff  try that with a smaller car  The controls are standard Ford  3 rotary dials for climate  cruise control on the steering wheel  and minimal usage of steering wheel stalks  This being my third Ford  I like my controls predictable  so I am very happy with the interior ergonomics The rear cargo area is cavernous and the pull down handle on the rear door is nice  The step up bumper allows easy access should you need to actually get in the cargo area The Appearance Package provides step bars instead of running boards  Being tall  I don t like any step up features at all  considering them to be a wuss feature  however  the women in my life all consider this to the best feature of the truck  go figure  Personally  I have to be careful or they get my pant legs dirty  There are grab handles for all 4 outboard passengers  Mechanicals The ride and power is comparable to other SUVs  Remember I have the 5 4  In test drives I found the 4 6 to be underpowered  which is not true for the F150 Pickup  One interesting note is that there seems to be so much power and low end torque that extra weight in the car seems to have little effect  I have had 800 lbs of passengers and could not tell from the way the vehicle handled and accelerated  The handling is great for something so large and the ride is exceptionally smooth for what is essentially a dressed up pickup  The anti lock brakes are better than the average  It comes with massive 4 wheel disks and does a good job stopping quick   The electronic AWD 4WD works perfectly and is easy to use and understand although it is a little close to the ventilation knob  both in distance and shape  While I feel that this vehicle is tough enough to take off road  see my Subaru Outback epinion  I found the suspension to be a little spongy for off roading  When combined with the tremendous weight of this thing  I suggest keeping it on the pavement  In all fairness I have taken some roadway dips at higher speeds and never actually bottomed out  This might all be a perception thing on my part  Seating The front seats are comfortable for longer drives  The second row seat allow 3 adults to sit without touching one another or the seat backs in front of them  The 3rd row seat is good for smaller people  I have had kids back there and they actually enjoy it  kind of like riding in the back of the station wagon when you were a kid In 14 months of ownership I have not had a single problem  The quality of this vehicle is truly first rate All in all this is one fantastic vehicle and I will probably buy another one in a few years  
Pos, I personally never owned or liked Fords until my husband and I went shopping for vehicles  I was a GMC kind of gal and was really looking more at the GMC Suburbans  My husband is a Ford fanatic and has owned Fords all his life  I didn t like his F 150 because of the leather seats and even though it was a 3 door  it was too small for us and his 3 kids  On this trip we went into a dealership and I was looking around while he arranged some maintenance for his pick up  I actually liked the look of the Expedition  and was asked if I would like to test drive it  I said  quot sure quot  knowing my heart was set on a Suburban  I LOVE the way the Expedition handles and the comfort level while driving  It was perfect and it opened my eyes  It handles and rides like a car  The seating is more comfortable than any SUV we had previously driven and the adjustable pedals are a blessing  The back seats are even comfortable  The third row seats are fine as long as you don t try to put a 6  tall person back there  a teenager or two would fit back there comfortably  The only thing I don t like about this SUV is the small amount of space behind the 3rd row seats  I guess that is why there is a luggage rack on top  We opted for the 2 wheel drive model as we live in Arizona and don t venture much in snow  That is where the posi trac rear end comes in handy  It senses slipping and the posi trac kicks in  Hubby really liked that feature and was glad to have had it while going up through the Colorado mountains  I think this is the perfect car for families wanting to travel in comfort or for people wanting to start a family sometime soon  The automatic locking doors are perfect for keeping small children in tow while trying to remove groceries and such  This feature also keeps the curious kids from accidently opening the door while the vehicle is moving  An excellent choice in my book  Lots of other features and goodies are available but my advice would be to test drive one and fall in live with it on your own br br  
Pos, In November of 1999  my wife decided that she was interested in an SUV and wanted to trade in our 1997 Dodge Ram  I had bought a 1999 Jeep Wrangler for myself earlier in the year  so who was I to argue We went to all of the differant dealers in the area and checked out the Dodge Durango  the Jeep Grand Cherakee  Chevrolet Blazer  GMC Jimmy and Tahoe  We then went to the Ford Dealer to see an Explorer before we went back to make a deal on the Duango  While walking across the lot to the Explorers my wife spotted the Expeditions  She immediatly locked on to a gold XLT and the Durango was forgotten  A test drive cinched the deal Since then we have taken a 1200 and a 600 mile trip experiencing all types of weather each time  The Expedition is a dream to drive  handles well and the gas mileage is reasonable  We get about 15 mpg in the city and about 18 on the highway  I have owned a good many vehicles in my time including a new Cadillac Sedan Deville and this is my all time pick for comfort  Safety is another factor as you sit nice and high and the Expedition has a nice heavy secure feel  We have the small V8 and power is not lacking When we fold up the third seat we have all of the room we need and if we remove the third seat and fold the second seat the space approximates that of a pickup  Long objects like lumber fit on the roof rack We have added tinted window vents  about  40  tinted front windows  about  70  and a K amp N air filter  about  55  When backing the vehicle seems longer than it is and the rear window being up so high makes it appear that vehicles and objects behind you are closer than they are One special luxury that we enjoy is the power operated adjustable gas and brake pedal  My wife is 5 2 quot  and runs the pedals all the way up and I like to have the lowest pedal setting  A touch of a button is all it takes  The only item I wish that it had was the memory settings for the seat adjustments but we can live without them All in all Ford has a winner with the Expedition  the comfort of a luxury car while giving more room for passengers and cargo  I had doubts at first about getting rid of our pickup because it was so handy  but no more  I am sold on the Expedition  We looked at the Excursion while we were at the Ford dealer but it was just too big for us Try one on for size and I ll bet you will be the next buyer br br  
Pos, When I see a Ford Expedition on the street  I decide for buy it  Because it was excellent  It is better than Lincoln Navigator and Dodge Durango  Because It is more powerfull than Durango  cheap than Navigator and has same luxury whic I buy a Eddie Bauer 4x4 Fully Loaded  You can drive it ar snowy  rainy days without dangerous  It is an excellent car  More roomy than Durango and strong than Navigator ENGINE  V8 The current V8 gives out 260hp  I feel more  which are adequate numbers for adequate engine performance  We could feel the power draining a bit when we loaded the truck with people  however  Still  the shifts are smooth and the power curve is evenly proportioned throughout acceleration  My main gripe with the engine is the sub par fuel economy  Even for an SUV  the Expedition especially 4WD models  I hear  seemed excellent  The rather not small gasoline tank is not to blame for frequent fill ups  I would not recommend the 4 6 235 hp 8 cylinder that is also offered  Manual transmissions are not available for either engine selection  although automatics are far more popular The Expedition uses an on demand 4 wheel drive system and can be shifted from 2 wheel drive into 4 wheel drive while the vehicle is in motion  Maximum towing capacity is 8000 lbs br br  
Pos, We purchased the Expedition XLT Sport edition in Jan 2000 upgraded engine  cloth seats  upgraded running boards  6 disc CD player We have 4 kids  3 of which are still in some form of carseat booster seat  So  when we went shopping for a larger vehicle  one major requirement was being able to seat 3 carseats alongside one another  without any complications  In many cars  vans  and even some SUVs  it s almost impossible to do that without having one carseat pushed up against the other to the point where the seats don t sit evenly  Amazingly enough  we were able to put all 3 carseats in without any trouble at all The other problem we faced was my husband   his height  He s 6 6  That leaves a lot of cars out of the running because he s either scrunched up in the driver s seat  with his knees hitting the steering wheel  or his head is hitting the interior ceiling Personally  I favored the design of the Dodge Durango  but alas  my husband s head not only hit the ceiling  but if it had had a sunroof  his head would ve been out of the car After looking at the Fords  I really wanted the Excursion because of the extra storage space  but my husband was concerned about the gas mileage  Moot point in the end because he works from home  therefore  no commute  We only spend about  40 a month on gas  price being about  1 60 gal in N  Calif  because we only drive places a couple times a week as a family We solved the space issue in the Expedition by folding down the two middle row seats  leaving the 3rd seat behind the front passenger seat up  and being used  then placing the other 3 kids in the back row  This freed up a bit more usable area for groceries or the stroller Overall  I ve been happy with it I like the fact that the driver s seat is adjustable  as are the brakes  because I m only 5 5  It s been an easy vehicle to drive  unlike some of the minivans I ve owned before  ie  Dodge Grand Caravan   the Pontiac Transport  and it actually doesn t drive like a large vehicle My only real complaint is the lack of storage if you are putting more than 5 people into this car  I still think that once we re ready to trade this vehicle in  I m going to push for the Excursion or possibly a Suburban  
Pos, My family has been a Ford family for the past 40 years if not longer  My husband and I have just purchased a 2000 Ford expedition earlier this month  we are expanding our family and needed a bigger vehicle to fit our family and our belongings  The third seat in the back is a great idea it can be removed if we need the space or it can be used for extra passengers  It is so much more convenient then a compact car  We went from a dodge stratus to the expedition and in the car we could not have anyone ride with use so if we want to go some where with some one we would have to take at least two cars and that got pathetic  My mother has owned a expedition for 3 years now so we were not really getting into something new  She has had no problems with her expedition and we hope that we will have no problems either  This is a great car  truck  SUV  what ever you want to call it  it is comfortable to drive and easy to ride in so now I cant wait until our next long road trip br br  
Pos, This review comes about mostly as a rebuttal to my wife who insists on comparing her car  a 1995 Honda Civic DX  to mine  1993 Ford Escort GT Let us take a look at the individual parts and then the Gestalt whole  shall we ENGINE  9 Possibly the strongest reason for buying the car  Mazda s 1 8L DOHC pushes out 127 hp  and it does so pretty effortlessly  Willing to rev  the secret formula is that the engine feels so strong because the car is so darn light  When new  the published 0 60 times on this car were in the high 7s  low 8 second region  That was faster than many cars twice its size  mostly because they were twice its size  This allowed me to surprise many Taurus  Olds Cutlass and Chevy Lumina owners at stoplights  The only problem I have is that the car is geared relatively low for quick acceleration  and so cruising at 75mph it is turning between a fairly noisy 3500 4000 rpm  The upside to this is if you mash the pedal even at 80mph  the engine is right in the sweet spot of the torque curve and surges forward nicely HANDLING  8 Again  excellent in a car so priced  The car feels light and tossable in corners  yet tracks straight at speed  Stiff spring and shock rates coupled with wide tires make this thing hang on tenaciously in turns  There is one large BEWARE  however  Lift throttle induced oversteer can be extreme when cornering hard  I personally enjoy it because I can flick the tail out easily when I m in the mood  but to the novice or inattentive  watch out  My wife was driving with me in the rain about 8 weeks after I bought my baby  and she let off the gas mid turn on a wide sweeper and the tail came right around  sending us grinding across a low stone wall  taking out the entire undercarriage  almost  9K damage  The dealership did a bang up job of putting it back together and it has tracked straight as an arrow ever since RIDE  6 The stiffness that makes for such good handling translates into so so ride comfort  A little tire noise and bounciness over bumps is tolerable The lightness comes at the expense of not having much sound deadening insulation  I do have to say I have gone through 3 sets of brake pads  but I drive pretty hard  and this may be normal wear for 146K miles  I also seem to go through tires pretty fast  which may also have to do with my relatively aggressive style  sidenote  OEM tire size is 185 60R15  and the ONLY tire made in that size is the OEM Goodyear Eagle GT 4  which are expensive  99 apiece  My solution after 100K miles was to switch up safely to 195 60 s which are available in more and cheaper brands TRANSMISSION  8 Shifts just fine  not crisp but not sloppy  even after 146 000 miles  never been replaced  original clutch  effort is light  The only thing I wish I had was a quick little wrist shifting car like a Miata or Toyota MR2  The throw on the GT is not nearly as long as on my old 84 EXP  but it s not as short as I d like EXTERIOR  8 My wife will argue this to death with me  but I still think it looks sporty  I first fell for this car in it s 91 92 Iris package trim  with the alloy wheels that matched the car s paint color  I ended up with the silver alloy wheels  and I think they look even better  It s no  vette  but it still looks better than a Tercel or Corolla  or even my wife s Civic anyday INTERIOR  7 OK  this is not a luxury car by any stretch of the imagination  First of all  the GT comes with virtually nothing power  no power windows  locks  seats  airbags  etc  The logic behind this is that all of those things add weight  which would slow the car down  The interior is sparse  the cupholders good  dash has usable space  plastic is hard  not great but not tacky either  The controls are intuitive and well placed  none have ever broken on me  The stereo is good  though again its speakers are odd sizes that are only slightly more difficult to replace with aftermarket than usual  The A C is ICE cold  still a good freon system  not the lukewarm R134a system my wife has in hers  The seats are comfortable for me  but in all honesty not the greatest for long hauls  but the side bolstering is good and adjustments are easy  with a lot of room if you re tall and up closeness if you re short  The one feature that I am continually AMAZED at is the amount of cargo space I have if I fold the rear seats and load from the hatchback  This car is cavernous  I haul to the dump  carry lumber  have moved twice with it  it just has a ton of room for such a small car RELIABILITY MAINTENANCE  10 So far  this is where my baby has shined  My wife talks on and on about her Civic s superior quality  but here is a stone cold fact  my car has virtually no repair history to speak of  No kidding  And this car has 146 000 miles on it  Replaced the timing belt at 100K  the 90 degree elbow off the exhaust manifold finally rusted through 6 months ago  I replaced it  but the all stainless pipes from the flex pipe back is all original  I mentioned tires and brakes going quickly due to my driving habits  No tranny clutch problems  a LITTLE tiny bit of oil leakage finally the last few months  what do you expect after almost 150K   all original hoses  belts  brake lines  master cylinder  suspension  cables  etc  The A C compressor just went on me this week  July 2000  and will need replacing  I put new plug wires on it 5 yrs ago  and I think I had one small leak  quickly sealed  around the rear window when I first got it  One small niggling problem  I feel like I have replaced a lot of headlights and foglights  but what is that   10 or so for a bulb  All in all  for 150 000 miles I have had nothing but trouble free driving pleasure from this car  and isn t that what it s all about OVERALL  Well  tallying it up  it looks like the average score for my little pocket rocket is solid 8 0  even though she s a 10 in my heart  For the money  some of the cheapest fun you can have on the road  Good looks  great performance  solid reliability  tough to beat in its class  What a package br br  
Pos, This is a nice little car but when i say little i mean it  You could not fit four good sized guys in this cars it would come apart at the seems  The only other downfall is that is has aluminum heads on it and if you overheat the car once you will most likely crack the heads  But other then that it is not a bad little car if you are looking for a beater to get back and forth to work  And they get great gas mileage about 30 miles to the gallon  I would recommend this car to anyone that is looking of cheap transportation     
Pos, I discovered yesterday that it would be cheaper for me to rent a car than it would be to take a taxi or shuttle to get home So  I called Hertz and said  quot I want the cheapest car I can get quot They set me up in a Champagne colored Ford Escort  A rather nice looking vehicle  For day to day use  I like larger cars  like my Dodge Intrepid  But I simply needed to get from point A to point B  and then briefly to point C to drop the car off  so I wanted something with four wheels and an engine If Hertz s cheapest car is the Ford Escort  anyone who pays for an upgrade is just throwing away money In a hurry  we threw all the suitcases in the back seat of the car  It looked like it had decent legroom  I got into the car and immediately noticed how it different from other rentals I ve had  several  98 and  99 Chevrolet Cavaliers and a 1998 Ford Escort   Disclaimer  I ve also rented a 1999 Jeep Wrangler  but these are for two different types of uses The 2000 Ford Escort looks and feels nice inside  The steering wheel is pretty thick  My Dodge s is a little thicker  but it s still formidable  The window and lock controls are firm and sturdy  the gear shifter well made and sturdy in your hand   The other rentals felt plasticky with snap together pieces that didn t always fit well All of the climate and radio controls are easily reachable by both the driver and passenger  The radio sounds clear and the air conditioner blasts cold air pretty well  What s really cool is that the radio displays the time  and  the radio station at the same time  No having to push buttons back and forth  The seats are comfortable and you have a good view of the road  The rear columns are thin  meaning less blind spots  The windows go up and down quickly and quietly   But  you probably want to know  how does it drive b This is where the 2000 Ford Escort impressed me the most  The car handles very well  Its steering is crisp and its acceleration is amazing  I m used to a much heavier car and I was incredibly surprised at how quickly this car accelerated  It cruised well at 75 and is a very quiet car  inside  The engine noise is very muted  It also breaks quickly If I were still in college and had had a chance to drive this car  I would have wanted one br br  
Pos, My best friend had just recently purchased a Ford ZX2  When I found out that he had traded his Camaro for this small gas saver I was greatly disappointed in him  But my opinion changed when he was telling me about how little it cost him and how great it was on gas I was starting to get interested  He invited me for a ride in his new car and I accepted  As soon as I sat in the comfortable seat i fell in love  For a small car it rode like it was at least  20 000 with a 6 cylinder motor under the hood  But that was just the beginning  We drove for about a half an hour and i was surprised when he asked me if I wanted to drive it  I accepted in an instant  I got behind the wheel  and off we were  The ZX2 is such a blast to drive  and the handling is outstanding  Maneuvering through traffic is no problem with this peppy little four banger  What I like the most about this car is its ability to get up to speed quickly  its comfortable and sporty interior  and its dual airbags make this a safe  dependable  low maintenence car for anyone who wants to save money and have something sporty at the same time  I highly recommend going to the dealer and at least taking one of these for a test drive     
Pos, I feel that you can not go wrong buying a Ford Escort  whether your buying it brand new or used My husband and I bought an  85 wagon two years ago  It had 130 000 miles on it when we got it  and now has about 300 000 miles on it  We ve taken it on several road trips  stuffed several people in it  and loaded it down the groceries  We also had an awesome Pioneer system in it  that should have  in all reality should have shook the car apart  A couple of time we with a month or so over on oil changes  and never had a problem with it  Eight months ago we discovered that the head gasket was blown  We decided to drive it until it blew up  Well guess what  it is still running like a champ  We also purchased an  87 Escort about six months ago  To our surprise it had the original  factory oil filter  tran  filter  spark plugs  and wires  The same parts for twelve years  I have never heard of any other car running on the original parts  Ford has definitely won us over  We don t plan on purchasing another vehicle any time soon  but if we where to buy one  it most certainly will be a Ford Escort   
Pos, I bought my Ford Escort ZX2 in November  1999  It was the first new car that I ever bought  I d previously purchased used cars  I didn t do a good job comparison shopping  and ended up paying more for it than I should have p The car is great  I love the way it runs  the way it looks  and the way it sounds  I get about 28 miles per gallon  and that s so important with today s gas prices p The only drawback that I ve found with this car is the price of the tires  Ford Motor Company decided to use a certain size tire on these cars  and Goodyear is the ONLY manufacturer of this particular size  There is no other size that fits on the rims   I went to 4 different tire dealers looking for cheaper tires  The lowest I found was  79 00 per tire   plus installation p Since 2 of my tires were bad  and the other two had a lot of wear  I replaced all 4 tires  These  79 tires lasted only a few months   I went to another tire dealer who told me it may be possible to get different rims  He looked in a junkyard for me and found 4 rims for  60  yes  used  BUT I was able to then get  normal  sized tires at only  35 each   The big drawback of all this is now I have  ugly  rims  black with no chrome  on my car that I should now paint p All in all  I do love my car  
Pos, My wife and I are on our second Ford Ranger  We leased our first one two and a half years ago  We ve found that the Ranger is tough and reliable  Not a thing has gone wrong with either Ranger that we ve owned  The Ranger that we currently have is an extended cab model  which I highly recommend  The space that you get behind you seat is worth the expense  The jump seats come in handy when taking on unexpected riders  We also got the four door option  which is also very convenient  My only complaint with my 99 is that I wish I had gotten a bigger engine  as my new one is under powered  Leasing frightens a lot of consumers  we have found that there is nothing to be afraid about it  The first Ranger that we leased went over the given mileage by twenty thousand miles  But the Ford dealership that we went to forgave the mileage when we got our new one The Ford Ranger is a very good vehicle and I recommend it to anyone br br  
Pos, I had been driving an 1987 Ford Bronco selected by my husband who wanted a big vehicle  which was slowly rusting away over the last few years and beginning to have some mechanical woes  I started out shopping for a used small truck with automatic transmission  I didn t particularly want a 4x4  although had gotten out of some situations with the Bronco s 4 wheel capabilities  I looked on line  in classifieds and at local car dealers  It was very difficult to find anything to meet my needs  most trucks were standard transmission  and had high mileage Finally one of the dealers called  they had just gotten in a new 1999 Ranger XL which met my needs  It also had a 6 cylinder engine  which was strongly recommended over a 4 cylinder by my male relatives and trusted mechanic I m really glad I spent the extra money and brought this truck  It is easy to drive  and I feel secure in it  It s isn t as high off the road as the Bronco was  but enough height to feel I have adequate vision  The Ranger doesn t have too much room in the interior  My son  who is quite a bit taller  feels that his left arm is cramped against the door  I recently added a cap  and feel this makes the truck feel more solid now  For example  when I crossed train tracks the rear of truck would bounce  Now it holds the road better  I also added a floor mat and that seems to have made it a quieter ride  I think the a c and heater are really great and do their jobs well  the radio has good quality sound I have a cassette player which I like  as I often listen to speakers on tape I would recommend this truck to someone who wants a vehicle for every day use  I think it would be a uncomfortable for a large person  And a person who depended on a truck for business would probably want a long bed  But for my needs  it is super br br  
Pos, My husband has always wanted a new truck and last year we went searching for a new vehicle  We waited until the end of the year clearance time and we found it  We got in on a Ford red carpet lease at 3 4  interest  For real  This was a terrific deal and the saleswoman and entire staff were easy to deal with and it is very fast getting regular maintenance appointments with our local dealership We have the extended cab  flared sides 6cylinder and it gets excellent gas mileage  In fact  it does about the same as my little car and we can haul with this baby  We put a hitch on it and took it to the home improvement store with our trailer on the back and it rode so smoothly you would never know that you had a trailer in tow  We are used to towing behind a Suburban  so that is saying a lot  The only thing I would change is that I would have more room in the extended part for seating  but I know that is really not what the truck was designed for  Driving this vehicle is as smooth as driving a car  It handles terrific and the paint job just gleams in the sun after being actually almost two years old  We have had no problems with this truck and IF we don t buy it at the end of the lease we will jump into another one  No question in my mind about that This is not a large family vehicle for certain  You can easily allow two children to safely ride in the jump seats  but they would have to be small children and I would not suggest a long trip because they would not be comfortable  But anyone who wants a truck for the smaller hauling jobs  or trailer towing  this is perfect  This is also great to go shopping with  put your large purchases easily in the body of the truck and you still have plenty of room for your groceries behind the seat  I do it all the time br br  
Pos, I had a 89 Ranger up until 9 months ago  I finally decided to look for something newer  I also have a Bronco  so I was already set on a Ford product  After going from lot to lot  town to town  I finally found just what I was looking for The truck I bought is a 99 XLT Ranger 4X4 Supercab  quadcab  It has the 3 0 engine as I don t need the 4 0 which has a few more hp and less mpg I have no problem pulling a boat with this truck  I have the automatic  with overdrive transmission My hardest decision was whether to get the flarebed or straightbed  I went with the flarebed  It looks so much better This is a very sporty truck that lacks no power  It is a very comfortable ride with minimal windnoise I have had it in the mud and snow on several occasions  No problem  I have the  off road package  4wheel drive with the skid plates on the transmission  It came equipped with driver airbag and passenger airbag  The passenger airbag can be disengaged  Good feature  My truck is loaded with the exception of the power package  which consists of power doors locks and mirrors  I am very satisfied with this purchase  The sound system is awesome The Ranger was the best small truck I test drove  and had the best overall looks  I know  performance comes first  and it performs  trust me on this I love the way this truck handles  on and off road The ONLY setback is the bed  inside to inside  is not 48 quot  wide I understand that we are all different and have different needs  So  if you are looking for a truck  take a look at the Ranger  This is my first NEW auto purchase  as I have always preferred buying used br br  
Pos, We bought the 1999 Ford Ranger for our daughter  She was headed off to college and needed reliable  safe  and affordable transportation  We haven t had one misgiving since purchasing it over a year ago My husband liked the idea of a vehicle with a full body frame  I like the idea of the dual airbags  The 4 cylinder engine doesn t use up excessive amounts of gasoline  making it a vehicle she can afford to drive The cab is small  but that s okay with us  too  This ensures she won t have loads of passengers with her  We bought the basic model  which included only a cassette player  radio  but no air conditioning   Hey  we were buying her a vehicle  what more could she ask for My husband likes the idea that with a 4 cylinder  she doesn t get a great deal of pick up when accelerating  I just like the idea that it starts every time she turns the ignition  whether in the heat of summer or sub zero winter temperatures The truck bed has come in handy  especially when she moved all of her belongings away to go to college We purchased the Ranger with Ford s 0 9  financing  With a little homework we discovered that we actually saved money buying her a brand new Ranger  rather than the 1996 we had first considered  
Pos, When I first saw this bright red 1999 Ford Ranger XLT Sport with  quot aerodynamic quot  striping  I thought it would be the perfect vehicle for my teenage daughter  I d bought her a 1999 Mazda B3000 Cab Plus 4 pickup three months earlier  and assumed this adorable truck would steal her heart and give ME the stodgier four door Mazda truck  She refused to give up the Mazda and I realized this was the perfect truck for a 40 something Mom who never had anything so cute  What s more  the 4 0 L engine allowed it to pull a horse trailer  with horse  I bought the truck used with 100 miles on it from a man who had won it at the local Ford dealership  It had never been titled or registered and was covered with the stickers of the local radio station which had sponsored the contest   Luckily  they came off easily  I must admit that the powerful  roaring 4 0 L engine has brought out the teenager in me and I sometimes just can t help leaving everyone behind when the traffic light turns green  When I drive more responsibly  I can get 20 MPG out of the truck  although 18 19 MPG is the norm  It was 15 MPG in the very beginning  but increased as the truck broke in  Unfortunately  this truck has Firestone Wilderness HT tires and I ve already made Firestone replace one for free when it was almost bald at 12 000 miles despite recommended rotations and balancing  They gave me a big talk about different qualities of rubber  but I know I ll be replacing all four tires within the year  After one year I ve had no problems whatsoever and have not even visited the dealer  I ve changed the oil myself and had the rotations balancing done at the local Tire Kingdom  I have another 20 000 miles warranty but hope I never meet the service department of the local Ford dealership  The interior is comfortable but not plush  The seats are a mixture of a tweed like material with a little velour thrown in  Very adequate  I wish I had an extended cab but I ve learned to simply take all the junk I ve accumulated out of the truck each weekend  I knew I never needed to keep that gallon of windshield washer fluid with me all the time  but now I KNOW I can t  This is the first time I can honestly say I love my vehicle br br  
Pos, This past summer i bought my 1999 Ford Ranger extended cab off road truck  I am pleasantly surprized with it s options and handling ability  My truck is fully loaded with all the options and is manuel and i love it  It handles great on all the turns and since it is a V 6 i have plenty of power for all my needs  The 4x4 is great in the winter and whenever i am hauling or off roading  If you are looking for a truck that isn t huge but has all the power you would need  the Ranger is the way to go  The ride is quite smooth considering it is a pick up  The only downfall that i have found is that the seats in the extended cab area are tight  You surely would not want to make someone travel back there for long     
Pos, I have a 1999 Wedgewood Blue ext cab  4 door  automatic ranger  It has a v 6 engine and it s fully loaded  I love this truck  Not only is it the best looking truck i have seen in a long time  it is so nice  I would rather be in it than anywhere else  The gas mileage could be a little better  but if you want better mileage i would recommend a standard v 4  which is what i had before this truck  This truck has great features like a switch to turn passenger side air bags off and on  some extended cabs come with 4 doors  which makes getting in and out alot easier  mine can run on ethanol fuel and everything else that you can think of  This truck is also safe  I was recently in an accident  The other car hit me pretty hard and my damage was minimal  This truck is built  quot FORD TOUGH quot This truck is worth every cent that I paid for it  19 998  There is a ranger for every price range  And all of them are wonderful The only thing that I don t like about this truck is the color that I picked  It gets dusty where I live  and my truck is constantly dirty A ranger is a great vehicle for anyone  but since it is so easy to handle on the road  it s a wonderful first car This isn t really a family truck  but what truck is  If you have long legs or a large build  you will not be comfortable in the back seat     
Pos, My T bird has been a great car so far  Everyone who has driven it has commented on how smooth it drives and how well it handles the road  Rain and snow are not a problem  this car is built for all weather conditions  Not to mention  mine came with the climate control that allows you to control the temperature of the car  so it s REALLY a joy to drive  no matter what it s like outside  The only problems I ve had have been that the vacuum hose disconnected itself somehow  but that caused minimal problems   mainly  it just made an annoying sound  I need new engine mounts right now  but I attribute that to the roads in this area   my husband just had all 4 replaced on his car I love the options on my car  and it s good for getting the baby car seat in and out  It s great for local driving or roadtrips  My sister has had to replace the engine and transmission on hers  but it s been driven rough  Treat this car good  and it will be a joy  
Pos, I am a proud owner of a Ford Explorer  I received this car about 3 years ago  and would not trade it for the world  An Explorer can fit tons of stuff in it  trust me I fill it to the brim everytime I go back to college  Not just things  but you can fit several people in there and still have a comfy ride  In fact the Explorer is so comfy  I can drive 4 hours without having to stop and stretch  The Explorer has electric seats  which makes it perfect for any size person to drive  because it so easy to adjust Gas goes a long way as well  granted it is expensive to fill up  but once you do you won t have to for a while An Explorer is dependable and sturdy  Over Thanksgiving I was rear ended by a car that was rear ended by a mack truck and there was no damage done  Rarely do I need to take my car in for anything other than an oil change  I know when this Explorer dies  the next car I will get will be an Explorer br br  
Pos, I bought my Ford Explorer in 1993 when they weren t the  quot station wagon quot  of the 90 s  I have a dirt road 1 3 mile long with lots of ruts and bumps  I haul pot bellied pigs and my dog  straw  heavy food bags and drive on the lawn  My Explorer has lasted with general maintenance and new tires  This vehicle is great for riding tough  I change the oil regularly and the air filter maybe once a year  This vehicle is not made just for good looks  This vehicle is for someone who wants to run their car  haul  and off road br br  
Pos, I bought my 1993 Ford Explorer because I wanted a bigger vehicle to haul around all my and my brother s stuff  For hauling it s great  It even tows very well  I towed my brother s boat 400 miles with absolutely no problems  It handles great with no real problems  and putting it in 4 wheel drive is easy  just push a button  My biggest problem is that in the winter I m from Iowa  this vehicle does not stop very well on snow or ice  Unlike most vehicles that may slide slightly  my Explorer is all over the road  You have to start stopping over a block before the stop sign  Anyone is fair weather climate should have no problems with this vehicle  Its great for hauling all of your things and towing your boats  etc  and it gets around great br br  
Pos, A few years ago we bought a Ford Explorer used at the dealership where it had originally been purchased  Three years ago we traded it for a custom van  I miss my Ford Explorer so much The ride was comfortable  and the seats were so comfortable  Throughout the time we had it  there were the regular maintenance needed  It did get to the point of needing the transmission replaced  the repair shop never told us it needed to be serviced  So when we had the transmission replaced we decided to trade it before it started needed more work Even though we have a van now  it was easier to carry groceries or anything in the back of the Explorer  I hope to buy another Explorer or perhaps an Expedition after the van is paid off br br  
Pos, I am overall very pleased with my Taurus  I am a student and my budget was tight  Accords of similar vintage cost roughly double  and up  of what I paid for this Taurus  Car was purchased with just under 140 000 on the odometer  Car currently has just over 162 000 The price paid includes conditioning costs  New Brake Pads  New Tires  Good Year Regettas  New Oil Pan  New Fuel  Oil    Air Filters  Thorough vacuuming  shampooing  and vinyl conditioning Things done prior to purchase by previous owner  New Struts  7 months  New Exhaust  1 yr old  New Hose   Belts  All maintenance done  records included with car  All recalls taken care of  Air conditioning switched to R 134a and refilled  New battery Problems with car  Surface rust on drivers door  fixed with friend The Little Things I Like  Self supporting hood with light  Courtesy lights on front doors  Drivers side dual sunvisors  allows you to put one to side and one to front  Blue tinted  factory  reduced glare mirrors  Secondary controls for radio  Separate clock  Bi level dash  Vents include a positive off position  Roof racks  Console  Powerful Air Conditioning  More powerful then our Toyota  Powerful Heater  Interior gas and tailgate release  Hatch can be opened with just window or whole tailgate  Large controls for power windows and power door lock  Power window drivers lock out  Dual air bags  ABS Standard  The 3 8L moves the wagon better then our 3 0L Camry under a load  Starts in  25C and 40C weather  first try every try  Large alternator and battery  Ride soaks up bumps  barely feel speed bumps  Storage compartment in rear floor  Blue gauges The Things I Don t Like  Weak Speakers  AM FM Cass not CD  Foot actuated parking brake  Seats dirty  spills from previous owner  One cupholder  Small Steel 14  wheels  Headlights aren t as strong our Windstars  Rear turn signals are red  No fender mounted turn signals  Common in N A  Rear wiper doesn t have intermittent setting  Front passenger window lazy  Stories heard about the 3 8L engine  Space saver spare  No Tachometer The Ride Quality The Taurus is not as sporty as our Camry  The Taurus sounds busy when accelerating  However once up to speed the Taurus is fine  Dash shakes at about 180km h  The Taurus seems more stable in winter driving conditions then the Camry  Brakes take a bit long to stop on black ice  The Taurus has very light steering  Power steering assist is a bit extreme  Not much feedback through wheel  Going over speed bumps is no problem  The Taurus doesn t like taking corners at much above the posted speed limit  When taking corners in the wagon you have to be careful due to the long rear overhang  Traction in the winter is adequate  I just worry about people slamming into me who don t have ABS  has happened twice The exterior Front marker lights are large  The car has clean lines but lacks styling and personality  Rear taillamps are only adequate in size  Turn signals aren t as noticable as our Windstar   Camry since they are not amber  Lower body cladding  Car seems lighter then the new Taurus  Windows are large  The curved rear window seems like it would cost a lot to replace  My body handles are easy to operate but are black and ugly  When you lift any of the four handles the interior lights turn on The interior The low dash gives good visibility all around  reminiscent of a Honda  Interior has that  old version of modern feel  to it  The front seats seem to be the same shape as the old Camry  Interior of my wagon only holds 5 people  Not much lumbar support  Seats are covered in a soft material   The material in the Windstar is much plusher  Overall I like the seat comfort more then our 2000 Camry  The Taurus has more windnoise inside then the Camry   although part has to due with the age of the car  Cars have come a long way in comfort  Interior plastics seem a bit too shiny  The interior plastics in the 2002 Ford Windstar have a softer more luxurious feeling to them  There is a handy built in pen holder  All controls are easy to reach  Radio has many small buttons  but that can be said about any DIN sized radio  Handy storage compartment below radio  The ashtray  my coin holder  is illuminated  All switches on the door and dash are illuminated except for the controls on the steering wheel  Wheel mounted cruise control is easier to operate then the stick type found on the camry  Dashboard clock is a nice touch Overall I am satisfied with my Taurus  It has been no problems with only oil changes every 5000km  So far the car is holding up very well  
Pos, After wreaking the other car we decided on a mid sized car  Well we have had it for about 3 weeks and are really enjoying it  It seats 6 comfortably  3 in the front and 3 in the back  it has auto windows  with a window lock power door locks lots of foot space in the front and back and power steering  I am really enjoying the power steering  it turns corners so easy and smoothly The comfort level in the car is great And talk about trunk space  The trunk is huge You could probably fit a small calf in it I highly reccomend this car br br  
Pos, I bought my 1993 ford Taurus a few months ago and I m totally pleased  I purchased it mainly because for an older used car  it had very low mileage and was kept in great condition with 1 owner  I have to say the size of the car took a little while to get used to since I had only had compact size before  It drives smoothly and only had to make 1 repair since I purchased it  And that was something small  a hose  The mileage is fairly good for a bigger car  Any used car should be looked at as that a used car  Don t expect to have no problems  especially with a 7 year old car  However  in my case  I am extremely pleased with my purchase  I would suggest this car for people who have a medium sized family and don t want something too large     
Pos, I was looking for my first truck in 1997 and after looking at all the makes  I settled on the Ford Ranger  I chose the Ranger because of the Consumer Reports Rec and the price  Went to a dealer  in Feb 1997  that had leftover 1996 models  First I test drove the regular cab but I just didn t fit as I m 6 2  and my knees were jammed into the steering wheel  Then I tried the extended cab model and found it roomy  I bought the Ranger Extended Cab XLT 2WD  5 speed manual  with AC  cruise  power windows  remote entry  I have loved this truck since I m still driving this truck today with 105 000 miles on it  Last week I just got a tune up for the first time for  240  I only had this truck repaired twice  once for a noisy wheel bearing for  90 and another time to weld a loose tail pipe for  40  That s it I find this truck very comfortable with the 60 40 split bench seat and the spacious cab  Another feature I like is the 19 9 gallon fuel tank  I average 22mpg for mixed city highway driving so I can get at least 400 miles between fuelings  This is handy on long trips There is one minor problem that I m living with  The dome light stays on intermittently  When I park and lock the door  the light stays on so I pulled the bulbs out of the sockets so I don t drain my battery The ride is decent  but a little noisy  not too serious though  Handling is decent  The 4 cyl has enough power to do the job but sometimes I wish I had some extra power to pass slower cars and for steep hills  It has 105 000 miles on it but I m not finished with it yet  I plan to keep it for another year at least 130 000 mile update  This truck is still going strong  No problems and made it through the winter without a hitch  
Pos, I know my limitations  My knowledge about automobiles is practical and every day  rather than research and engineering  I hate popping up the hood looking at the engine and I can t tell a cam from a ham  However  I m sure I ll be just as happy with my 2000 Ford Taurus as I was with my first two  If you re looking for a mechanical  high tech  motor minded review of the Taurus  stop right here  However  if you re interested on why I love my Ford Taurus  please read on I have always been happy with my Taurus for three reasons  Service and reliability  safety  and My Wallet  I always have had a 60 000 mile lease on the Taurus  With my first two  my only  quot major quot  expense in over 120 000 combined miles was a small  engine part  less than  100  I do follow the service manual for maintenance  relying on my friendly Ford dealer in Franklin  Wisconsin  for repairs and support  with reasonable  competitive rates  The manual says take it in at 25 000 for this this and this  I take it in  This system works for me  I might save a dollar or two by going to a quick lube place for an oil change  but the peace of mind is worth going to the experts  Plus  they keep an on line historical record of what maintenance has been done  Ford has implemented a  quot Personal Safety Package quot  for the 2000 Taurus  This includes  quot smart quot  air bags and deployment  side crash bars  and especially important  child safety seat anchors  If you ever lost a wrestling match with the back seat seat belt  trying to connect your kiddie seat  this offers ease of installation and added safety against shifting  Front Wheel Drive is a must in the midwest  as even in May  a snow storm can hit and make driving dangerous  FWD  as technical as I can get  gives me the additional traction necessary for safer driving  The interior is very roomy for driving  plenty of head and leg room  The bucket seats are comfortable  and the console is easy to use  The trunk is more than adequate for your needs  All this allows you a pleasant driving experience relating to a safer drive As for the wallet factor  as I mentioned  little or no major repairs  just routine maintenance  My gas mileage has ranged from 31  mph to 25 mph  The power to reach top speed is there when necessary  freeway ramps  etc  The Taurus is not a gas guzzler by any means The lease cost has always been competitive  with prices compared to other similar competing models and dealers  But why mess with a good thing  I have a winner  so stay with it  There s a reason why the Taurus has been one of the top three selling models in America  All three of my Tauruses  Tauri  have been reliable  roomy  maintenance free  fairly stylish  and economical br br  
Pos, I bought a 1988 Ford Taurus in 1996  It was a one owner four door sedan  Now I got to tell you  I do some serious driving  I drive back and forth to work 50 miles one way  This is a Monday through Friday driving experience and sometimes in not so nice weather because I live in Minnesota  After racking up the miles on our Ford Taurus  my husband took it over because he only drives 1 mile to work each day  We love that Ford so much that we went out and bought another one in 1999  Not just any Ford Taurus my friends  but another 1988 Ford Taurus  It was also a one owner four door sedan with low miles  We have been very pleased with the Fords  They run and run and run and run  I can depend on my Ford  I know that when I get up in the morning it will start and when I drive home it will get me there  We make sure the cars get a regular 3000 mile oil change and a six month check up with the old Auto Doc  Maintenance costs have been low and repairs not much to speak of really  I figure that I will be looking for another car in about 2 years and I can tell you with confidence that it will be a Ford Taurus br br  
Pos, Well  I have had my 2000 Taurus for about 4 000 miles now and would recommend it to anyone  The new design is much more eye appealing and the 200 hp Duratec V6 adds plenty of punch for a mid sized sedan I looked at the Intrepid  Impala and the Taurus  The Intrepid was also great but I opted to steer clear of Chrysler after being poorly treated by several Chrysler dealers in my area   The product was very good though  The Impala was also good but very pricey in comparison and I was concerned with the new model design ot being proven Back to the Taurus  I purchased the SEL model which has almost everything except a moonroof  The engine is smooth and quiet  it shifts great and handles good for such a heavy car   I believe it s the heaviest car in it s class  The ride is smooth as silk  and shifts are hardly noticeable  It has great passing power in the 50 70 mph range ABS works great as I found out right after I purchased it  The traction control is also great on slick roads  no snow test yet  However  both of these features are pretty noisy when the kick in  which is not unusual  The steering is also very responsive and again  it handles well for a heavy car  The one thing I could not figure out is why it does not have 4 wheel disc brakes  The rears are drums  Come on Ford get with the program I have been averaging about 22 25 mpg on a 50 50 mix of highway city driving  Leather interior is nice  seats could use a little more side support  As for the interior  the design is very conservative compared to its competitors  Very basic but functional controls  It s not as fancy as the Intrepid or Camry or any other of its competitors I also have the Mach stereo system as the car on the lot I chose had it already installed  I would not recommend this system  I believe it was a  675 option  You could do much better at your local car stereo shop for the same price  It s not horrible but for the money there is better out there  The six disc changer is nice even though it s located in the trunk   Ford should take a lesson from Chrysler with the four disc in dash CD  much more convenient The Taurus has a lot of great saftey features to go with its 5 star crash test rating  a big factor as I begin to start a family  Front and side airbags  ABS  fuel pump shut off to prevent fire  glow in the dark drunk release in case a child gets locked in the trunk I also have the keypad entry which is a cool feature although I have yet to use it  The heated mirrors will also prove to be useful when old man winter comes a knockin  Automatic headlights are great although they do not go on automatically when you put on the windshield wipers  many states require you have your lights on when you use your wipers  The trunk is huge and the rear seats fold down The climate control is great and I have actually received several favorable comments on how fast the A C kicks in even on 90 degree days  Have not used the heater yet  Front and rear defoggers work very well If you can live with the plain interior this car should be at the top of your list  I believe the 2000 model is back as the number one seller in its category this year but I m not positive br br  
Pos, Well  not a whole lot  to be honest  I ve always driven trucks or SUV s  and I was very reluctant about buying a car  You see  I m very short  This may sound unrelated  but I m just over 5 feet tall  and I never really liked the idea of being so close to the ground while I drove  Whenever I was forced to drive a car when my car was in the shop or being used by someone else  I always felt like I was driving a go cart So  when I recently decided to trade in my Explorer for something more fuel efficient  I figured I d stay with Ford and go for a Taurus  I purchased the Taurus LES  the luxury model  complete with leather interior and climate control  And I have to tell you  it s been absolutely incredible  Apparently  Ford has been working on the new design for the Taurus for somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 years  Although I m still closer to the ground than I d like  this model is much better than my mother s 1996 Taurus  The car rides much smoother than my Explorer ever did  and it s much more fuel efficient  So  if there is anyone out there who s been hit as hard by the gas price hike and is nervous about buying a car  I d highly recommend this beautiful  economical car     
Pos, When we bought our 1995 Ford Taurus we were in the market for a four door car  We were looking to trade in our 2 door Chevy Cavalier  We had just had our first baby and the 2 doors weren t helping getting the baby in and out of the car along with the other baby items  When we saw the Taurus we loved it  It had leather seats  very roomy and power everything  But we have encountered problems with it  I don t know if it because the previous owner didn t take care of it or what  We have had to fix the transmission twice and replace the fuel pump once  Overall it s costs us over five thousand dollars  But I still love this car  It s not a gas guzzler and it s not a huge vehicle  I would recommend any person with kids to buy this car  It has lots of trunk space as well  great if you have lots of things to take with you anywhere  The seats have lumbar support for those long travels  Only thing I wish it had was heated leather seats  The cold seats in the morning aren t the best     
Pos, If you had told me when I was 21 that I would be driving a station wagon within 5 years I would probably have laughed myself into a stuper  Well I was 23 when I decided that my kids and I had outgrown my little Calais and we needed something with more room  so I started looking for the perfect vehicle and I found it very quickly  My sister and I had been out and about when we first saw the  89 FOrd Taurus Wagon sitting there on the lot saying  quot buy me  buy ME quot  but I passed it off as  quot probably too expensive quot  Well with out my knowing about it my sister went to the lot and asked about the car for me  It was a 1989 Ford Taurus Wagon with 100 some odd thousand miles on it  air conditioner  AM FM radio tape  electric seats  locks and windows  rear defrost  and a few more nice little odds and ends  and the price was ONLY  2500  Well I called my loan man and he said offer  2100  they took it and I was the proud owner of a very roomy  and trustworthy vehicle  I had that vehicle for over a year when I decided to buy a new  used  vehicle  but the only reason I decided to get a new one was because my family was growing  I now had myself  my 3 kids  my fiance  and his daughter    amp  now one on the way  so we talked it over and decided to get a Mini Van  I still miss my wagon but I realize that for a family of 5 it is perfect but when you have a family of 7 that you need a bigger vehicle  If you are a family of 5 or more and looking for a nice  roomy vehicle the Ford Taurus is the perfect family vehicle but if there are more than of you it starts getting crowded br br  
Pos, I have been driving my 2000 Taurus for four months and have yet to have a single problem with the vehicle  I must admit that I did not buy or lease the car  My employer supplies me with a vehicle due to my line of work  Our company has been leasing the Taurus since 1997 and this is the best model year yet In the past we have had numerous problems with the front brakes and rotors  This problem area was most noticeable on the  98 and  99 models  My 2000 Taurus has 6000 miles on it and has shown no signs of any brake deficiencies  In the past we have had repeated problems with warped rotors and premature brake pad wear  When the local Ford Dealer told me that the problem had been corrected for 2000  I was skeptical  Now  I am a believer Additional improvements abound  My vehicle is the 4 Dr SES model with the OHV Vulcan V6  For 2000  the Vulcan s horsepower has been increased slightly and its NVH reduced  I have found these improvements to be noticeable  if not significant  The freshly restyled exterior and interior are also  subjectively  improvements over the old model  The visibility through the rear window is much better due to Ford  quot deep sixing quot  the oval rear window  The reduced blind spots are welcomed when trying to merge onto the freeways in Southern California  The quality of the interior materials is substantially better than in the past  There is no longer an abundance of cheap plastic on the door panels  center console and other areas  The interior is now much more mainstream  The oval dashboard has given way to a more traditional one which is slightly more ergonomic in design  Radio controls are grouped more logically and the auxilliary 12v power receptacle is now more accessible  My car is equipped with the full floor console with a floor mounted gear shift  In this configuration  Ford has designed a unique and very versatile cup holder  It can be adjusted to handle a beverage container of almost any size  This is particularly nice for those of us who spend hours stuck in traffic My model came equipped with a standard power driver s side seat  This is a nice feature on a car in this price range as it offers me an infinite number of seating positions  The seat also has an adjustable lumbar support which is handy on longer trips  The only aspect of the old Taurus seats that I liked better were their side bolsters  For 2000  the seats do not have nearly the lateral support that they did in  99  This is a small quibble considering the other improvements Interior details have also been attended to in the 2000 redesign  Effective map lights are well placed and easy to use  Split sun visors allow the driver and passenger to simultaneously cover the front and side windows  This is especially nice on those days when the sun cannot decide which window it wants to  quot attack quot  The visors also have nicely illuminated mirrors which were lacking from my last car I have been particularly impressed with the lower level of noise inside this year s model  While still not up to the Accord or Camry standard  it is still much improved from  98 and  99  The Vulcan V6 still roars when under heavy acceleration  However  now the roar is more muted The overall ride for 2000 is also enhanced from past years  A switch to 16 quot  tires and rims has certainly helped  Also  I have been told that Ford made a number of small suspension improvements to improve ride quality and responsiveness  I certainly have noticed the difference  The ride is still far from that of a touring car  but not at all unpleasant  When compared to my  98 Mazda Millenia  the Taurus falls short  However  I feel it is not that far off from  99 Honda Accords and Mazda 626 s I ve driven  It is certainly better than anything Ford has produced in the past in this class of vehicle I like the fact that Ford includes alloy wheels as standard equipment on the SES model  They add an upscale look to a  quot fleet quot  vehicle  Access to the trunk is also significantly better  as is the usable trunk space  The squaring off of the rear deck provided these improvements  Forward visibility is much better thanks to the redesigned headlights All in all  this is a very nice vehicle at a really great price point  In fact  I like it so much that I may end up buying a Taurus or Sable Wagon next year when I retire my old Volvo 740 Wagon br br  
Pos, I just bought a new 2000 Ford Taurus 3 weeks ago  and I ve put on 2000 miles so far  Overall  I am very happy with it BODY DESIGN The 2000 Taurus has a much cooler design than the bug eyed ovals of the last few year  I ve had many comments on how cool it looks  which is unusual for a family car  I read that they changed every body panel except the doors  Unfortunately  the design of the doors should have been changed  too  It is very prone to door dings since the top half curves out past the rubber bumper on the door  INTERIOR The interior is great  Both the front and back seats have a lot of leg room and elbow room  The controls are all easy to reach and easy to understand  ENGINE I have a 24 valve engine  It has significant power  It accelerates well from a standstill and at high speeds  The engine is very quiet in the passenger compartment  I also test drove a Volvo S40  and the engine was very loud  SOUND SYSTEM I have the Mach audio system which is Ford s top of the line  It sounds like a great home stereo system  My last car had Ford s premium sound  and I was not impressed  The Mach system is much better  One nice feature that my car has is a 6 disc changer with the cartridge inside the passenger compartment  This is available on the SE Comfort model if you get the floor shifter and center console  I also like that I have both a CD player and tape player OTHER FEATURES Automatic Temperature Control The automatic temperature control is a very nice feature  I can set a temperature and the car stays there  It is designed so most of the air blows toward the floor for maximum comfort  I really enjoy just setting the temperature to 68 or 70 and not messing with the controls after that Adjustable Pedals This is not a feature that I particularly wanted since I m pretty tall  However  it came with the car I bought  It seems like it would be a neat feature for someone who was shorter but wanted to sit further away from the steering wheel  With the touch of a button  you can adjust the pedals as much as 3 inches Air Bags I have side air bags  which is a nice saftey feature  In addition  the front air bags have extra sensors  The air bags will deploy at 3 different speed depending on the speed of the crash  the position of the seats  and whether the passengers have their seat belts on The driving experience is wonderful in this car  It is quiet  roomy  comfortable  and had a great sound system  I actually look forward to my commute for the first time in my life  I also love the new design I have had 2 minor problems  My airbag light came on 2 times in the first week  The dealership is not able to tell what may be wrong unless the light is on when I bring it in The second problem is that one of the back windows makes a clunk sound when it closes  The dealer attempted once to fix it  but he was unsuccessful  I will take it in again later br br  
Pos, My 36 month lease is set to run out on my 2000 Ford Taurus wagon  I have really enjoyed the large cargo area provided with the rear seats folded down  My experience is that the drivers seat was very comfortable although the seat backs could use more side bolstering  This car was definitely not a sporty handler  but the ride was stable at speeds into the 90 s and was very comfortable under most conditions My car came equpped with leather seats  side airbags  and adjustable foot pedals which made it easy for the driver to find a comfortable position  The stopping distances recorded by independent testers were longer than average for this mid level bracket  Another complaint is that while this is not a noisy car  neither is it as quiet as others in its  class  Since I take some extremely long road trips  noise is something I really notice  If Ford could reduce the engine noise  road and tire noise  and wind noise each a little bit it would greatly improve the driving experience  I felt that Taurus wagon had good materials and features for the price  
Pos, I m a Toyota person  but I came very close to buying the 2000 Taurus  I know that some people who have posted here have talked about reliability problems with Ford  But I think that was with their older models This car has a very handsome outside styling to it and beautiful colors to choose from  Their power driver s seat was one of the most comfortable  especially with the adjustable pedals 2000  I have ever sat in  and I can t begin to tell you the discomfort of my Corolla driver s seat  Also  in my never ending new car search  the Taurus was the most quiet at freeway speeds  The big  full center armrest adds a touch of luxury that seems to be missing from other cars in this class  The inside just felt so solid  sturdy  plush  and of course saftey  saftety  saftey  which is Ford s whole selling premise with the 2000 Taurus  Smart So why didn t I buy it  The gas mileage was a little low  18 19 street And  in the end  I just became obsessed with saving money and getting an  quot economy quot  car  not realizing that there s no value in saving money if you are dissatisfied in the long run  And gas prices are not going to stay high for ever  Me and my  quot poverty thinking quot  I realize now that I should have just went with what I really wanted  There s more to buying a car than simply trying to save money on gas  My advice is to buy more car than you think you will need  You ll be happier in the long run  I ll have a difficult time deciding between a Camry and a Taurus the next time I go looking for a car  which could be sooner rather than later     
Pos, I do not actually own this 2001 Ford Taurus  My parents own it  I own a 1991 Camaro and am used to a pretty uncomfortable ride  I am also used to extreme acceleration  The Taurus has got the RIDE covered  It does not have the ENGINE covered Every time you start out riding in the Tuarus  weierd engine noises accur  A sort of rattling and clanking if you will  It is a brand new car  so I DO NOT expect anything like that to be happening  It also has a really hard time starting up and idiling at start up if it is cooled out The Main and worst problem about this car is the pick up speed  very very pooor  We took it to the shop and told them of the poor pick up and they said its running fine Throttle response is very poor  You can push the pedel up and down when travling above 50 or so and nothing will happen until you take it all the way to the floor  Keep in mind that it is only a LX and is not a sports car  but that is saaad  Also the radio is not very loud either But  it is very very roomy with plenty of head room and leg room  especially in the back seat  Very large trunk space to put my bodies  I mean  No noise from the outside when in the car with the windows up  
Pos, I purchased my 1988 Ford Taurus in 1989 and at this time I have 87 000 miles on it  It has a 3 0 liter engine and when taking it on vacation I got 34 miles to the gallon  I have replaced tire rods on it  but by keeping the oil changed and keeping good coats of wax on it I hope to get more time out of the vehicle  There was a couple of winters I stored it but the vehicle has been ran all year round for about the last 5 years I really like how solid the vehicle is  The reason I know is I was hit from behind with a lot of force and it put just a little scratch on the bumper  The car rides very nice and has a large trunk perfect for taking on vacation  This car may not be for the single person  but it surly makes a good family vehicle     
Pos, While definitely not the most glamorous car to drive  the Taurus wagon is an efficient  quot soccer mom quot  car  After owning the old Taurus wagon model for a few years and having some problems I decided to trade it in for the  99 model and I m very glad I did  Driving this car is a very pleasant experience  I have had no trouble with brakes  acceleration  or  unlike with the old model  the air conditioner heat  The driver s seat adjusts in many ways so that I can be comfortable when I drive and stay alert  Even though there have been minor incidents in which this car has gotten roughed up  the only injury was done to the exterior appearance of the car  Even though I ve only owned this car for about a year  I am still happy with the fact that I have not had reason to bring it in for any repairs  After owning the previous Taurus wagon model and a Volvo wagon  I m glad to say that this is the best station wagon that I ve come across br br  
Pos, I have owned my Ford Econoline full size van  with Regency custom conversion for just over a year now  I love the van  It is such a comfortable ride compared to the other large vehicles on the market  like an Expedition or Suburban  because it isn t built on a truck frame  However  I have to say that dealing with the conversion people is like pulling teeth  Because all of the interior parts are considered part of the conversion  I have to wait for EVERY part to be ordered   even the seatbelts  which had dried glue on them  And any electrical problem is automatically blamed on the conversion people  The ground wire to the drivers side lighted vanity mirror was loose  so the light only worked intermittently  and it took several tries for them to finally get it right because they just kept trying to replace the part  not find the root of the problem  I realize that parts of this problem lies with the dealership  but they are the only Regency approved dealer in my area  so I am forced to use them instead of an alternate Ford Dealer br br  
Pos, Wow  what a truck  Or should I say Car With the way the Expedition drives and handles  it does not feel like the 5 800 lbs truck it really is  I have the first model year  1997  with the 5 4L engine  and 4wd  It has the rear bench seat  towing package  dual zone climate control  and the premium sound system The steering is variable power assit  which makes driving a car of this size a lot easier  Also  the larger engine helps with accelerating from a stop  but because of the immense weight of the car  you can forget about those quick 60 80mph passing acceleration  and don t even try to pass anything going up a hill at a fast speed Don t get me wrong  this car doesn t lack any  quot oomph quot  especially when it comes to towing  You don t even feel the weight of a 3 000 lbs boat behind you  And with a 8 000 lbs towing limit  you can certainly tow large loads Of course  if you are towing anything  you want to make sure you can stop with all that extra weight  No problem  I think the Expedition probably has the best brakes in it s class  You can t stop instantaneously  but for a car of it s size  you will be very surprised at how tight and responsive the brakes are If you are going to use this car as a  quot people mover quot  also  I would very strongly recommend that you buy the dual zone climate control  The powerful fans in these systems are ideal for any climate  They can heat the car faster then an explorer can  partly because of a very strong and powerful floor blower in the back  Likewise  they can cool the car very quickly  and keep it cooled While the four wheel drive differential lacks a neutral setting  I highly doubt this will discourage most buyers from purchasing this car  The best  and most used setting by me  is the  quot Automatic Four Wheel Drive quot  In this setting  the car is supposed to enage the 4wd system when it feels tires spinning un evenly  It is a great added comfort for wet or icy roads  and can be used up to 60mph  the system will automatically detect if you are going over 60  and won t engage so as not to damage the transmission All in all  Ford really came through with an amazing successor to the Explorer br br  
Pos, My Expy came with a trailer towing package  full power inside and inclement weather package  The motor a 4 8 liter  is very weak on power when towing  If your thinking of buying an Expy and plan on towing anything  I strongly urge you to consider the bigger motor  You will find that while towing anything  slight upgrades in the road will cause your Expy with the little motor to kick out of overdrive and into high gear  If you live in a mountainous area  then be prepared NOT to use overdrive Overall  my Expy is a comfortable ride and we have had little problems with it  The longevity of all Ford motors is proven  but do consider an extended warranty as this vehicle has numerous sensors that can nickle and dime you  I did have a bad ride and alot of road noise with the Goodyear tires that came on the expy from the factory  I switched to Michelins and found the ride much better and the road noise gone  Consider the Michelin LTX M S series tire for your expy if you change tires I enjoy my Expy and found it to be a comfortable ride  easy to manuever  stable at high speeds and during changing lanes and a real joy to drive  Hope you have as good a luck with yours br br  
Pos, When I was first on the market for an SUV  I was really looking for the Ford Explorer  A friend of mine has one and I absolutely loved driving it  It was a great truck  however  I couldn t find any decent  inexpensive  Explorers and I settled for a Jeep Grand Cherokee  This was a huge mistake After having the Jeep for about three months  I was in an accident  I was coming home from work when someone slammed into my passenger side  the car buckled and was ripped apart  Not only was I extremely shaken up  but I was also on the prowl for a new car Thankfully my insurance company is very understanding  and was extremely quick with my claim  I again set out looking for an Explorer  however when I got to the dealership  I found that love at first sight does exist When I saw the Maroon Ford Expedition  I was in love  This car is amazing  I know many people who look at it see only a massive road hogging beast  however the Ford Expedition is one of the most stylish  sleek  sporty SUVs in my opinion  However  don t get me wrong  my Expedition definitely has that rugged edge Driving an Expedition is something that everyone has got to get used to  Even if you have driven an SUV before the Expedition is rather large  it takes some time to get used to  Judging the distance from cars on your side and front is the most frustrating at times  but after a few drives  everything falls nicely into place Once you ve mastered driving  you get the uneasy task of learning to park the beast  My first tip  Stay away from parking garages until you are confident in your parking techniques  Parking in a parking garage is generally awkward  however when you ad the size of the Expedition  it gets even harder  Not to mention the fact that  and it never fails  the first time you drive into the garage you will worry that your car won t fit If you live in a city  be forewarned parallel parking is rough  It is hard to find spaces to fit the car into  but don t stress it too much  because although rare they are there  With a mastery of driving and parking  the car is perfect  The seats are remarkably comfortable and the car is extremely roomy The only part of the car that there is little to no headroom is the third seat in the  way back  The third seat is slightly raised and because of that you lose a little bit of headroom  and if you are a taller person you lose all of your headroom  Also  because the seat is raised  you don t have a place to put you legs  For my unfortunate friends in the  way back  I apologize  next time you ll remember to call shotgun won t you A few of the features that make the car even more comfortable  are the heating and radio features  First  my radio is a grade  A  CD Tape player  with a six disc changer for the CD player  The speaker system is very good  and although many people will add a specialized stereo system to their cars  the factory works fine for me Not only is the radio a great quality  but it has two sets of controls  The main console is in the dash board  however in the back seat  there is a separate console with a head phone jack for the people in the back to set their own stations according to their musical tastes  This feature is also found in the heating system  Both the front and the backseat have climate controls  to set the temperature for both portions of the car If you are looking for a massive car that handles amazingly well  I d recommend that you at least test drive a Ford Expedition  The car is great  and it is one of the most comfortable rides I ve ever had  
Pos, Dear S U V  shoppers  Your reading my review on this vehicle in hopes I can tell you all about the Ford Expedition  Well  your in a lot of luck because I have recently purchased one  This vehicle is a big thing on comfort  It used to be that if you sat in the back seat you were very uncomfortable  but in this vehicle the back seats are just as comfortable as the front  Not only that  but as well as holding 8 passengers when the THIRD row is set up this vehicle can tow a trailer behind it  For all you who show horses  and have a big family  you no longer have to rely on a pick up to get the job done  This means no more taking two vehicles and wasting money on gas  As for you who can t seem to stay away from the lake you can pull that nice boat behind you oh yeah  and don t forget all of your fishing buddies  When we first got our shiny new Expedition everyone wanted to ride in it  One of the options we decided on was a six C D  changer  Now there was no more reloading discs every time you wanted some new tunes  This came in as a nice option for the people in the back  for they could listen to the radio on headphones in the back when grandma up front wanted to listen to Jazz  no offense to jazz  I love it  but some people don t  Another thumbs up for the rear seat passengers are the separate heating and air conditioning controls for them  If they got could there was no more yelling at the driver to  quot Turn the heat up quot   I think we all know how annoying that gets  That means comfort for the drivers ears  and no more headaches  either  Well  to sum it all up  which is pretty hard to do  With everything this special S U V  comes with there s too much to say  Now there s only one problem  who gets to drive br br  
Pos, As a busy mother with two children and always on the go  I live in my car  it is like my second home  I have to be able to keep things in my car  quot just in case quot  when I am away from the home  My Expedition is big enough for me to do that without being  quot TOO BULKY quot  and still look good We have been looking at the Expedition since it first came out  We finally purchased one this past month  We looked at all the comparable SUV s but we felt the Expedition always came out ahead  It was big but not too big  We had the features of the larger SUV  suburban  excursion  without the bulk and still the sporty look of the smaller SUV  Driving this vehicle makes me feel safe with the kids THAT S IMPORTANT It drives smooth  sturdy  and strong  I don t feel as if I am going to be blown over by the wind  If you are a busy mom that needs a reliable vehicle with lots of room yet doesn t look like a bus  this car is perfect for you unless of course you don t like driving big vehicles   br br  
Pos, I leased this vehicle for two years  It was the best vehicle I have ever owned leased  What I noticed the most was how well it handled  I was worried with such a large vehicle that it would be hard to control  It had a very smooth ride and the steering was so much better than the Explorer I had before  I loved the heating cooling contols in the back of the vehicle  The room was so nice for my family of 5 as no one had to be crowded while traveling  The four wheel drive switch on the dash was awesome  I loved not having a shifter on the floor  The vehicle I leased had running boards which made it nice to get in and out of in a dress  It had a console with the CD changer inside  I loved being able to have 6 CD s in at a time and the ability to change them easily  I am not much up on the details of the engine  all I know is that it ran great and never gave me any trouble in the two years I leased  I am seriously thinking of leasing another one when the lease on our truck expires br br  
Pos, I purchased an Expedition in April  97  quite by accident  The Explorer that I had ordered was destroyed in the St Louis floods  Anyway  about the vehicle  A 1  The Expedition was a joy to drive  luxurious and car like  wonderful on a long trip  Four wheel drive made towing a large boat out of the water a breeze  even tore some trees out of the ground for a neighbour  no problem  The only problem I encountered in two years was a faulty solenoid on the four wheel drive motor  Got it stuck in 4wd low  For anyone that this happens to  its an easy makeshift fix  The solenoid is readily accessible on the side of the drive motor  It is vacuum operated so if the solenoid goes  just disconnect the vacuum lines and switch them around  This will get you to a dealer without being restricted to 20mph Gas mileage is not for the faint of heart or those relying on economy  9 miles per gallon in the city  13 16 mpg on the highway Shear size alone guarantees when two cars are going for the same parking spot  you win everytime Braking was excellent for such a heavy vehicle  6200lbs I miss my Expedition br br  
Pos, We purchased our Expedition after test driving both the Expedition and the Explorer  We are young with a growing family  so cabin space was very important to us  The Expedition had much more cabin space  with the ability to put three car seats across in the middle seat  With the Explorer  only one car seat would fit comfortably in the middle of the seat  We are very pleased that we purchased the Expedition which gives us ample room for traveling to haul all the extras  It also has a third seat which is nice when there are more than 5 passenger  It has a very nice ride and is very comfortable to ride in  The only draw back is the high cost of fueling the gas tank  If you have 2 or more kids and are looking for a sports utility vehicle I definitely recommend the Ford Expedition br br  
Pos, All right  now that I m married and we have a great dane  I have grown out of my regular cab Chevy  It has served it s purpose well and done everything I ve asked of it  but there is just not enough room anymore Now being from Texas  I m sure I m living up to every stereotype when I say   quot I love the Ford F 350 Crew Cab quot This truck is a giant sure  but when it comes to comfort  power and styling you just can t beat this truck The one I drove had the Lariat package which included all the bells and whistles  If your familiar with Ford trucks  you know that this is the top of the line  and they like to charge you for it The leather seats do more than just hug you  they embrace you  After a hard day at work they just call out to you  And this is a truck that actually makes you look forward to the commute  It s that comfy This truck also makes you feel really safe  The one I drove was a 4X4 so I sat higher than just about everything else out there  I was almost eye to eye with the big trucks  That was kinda cool As for power  how does 235 HP   2 700 RPM and 500 lb ft of torque   1 600 RPM sound  Yes  I had the Powerstroke diesel  Although this is not a choice for many people  this truck will out pull just about anything  And it looks good doing it Another thing I like about the diesel is that it s like riding on a Harley  The sound of it demands attention  Of course this Harley has a cab for 5  I got the bucket seats  air conditioning  CD changer  trip computer  and reliability One thing I haven t mentioned yet was rear seat comfort  Well  you won t be disappointed here either  I believe it s rated at 41 quot  of head room and almost 43 quot  of leg room  This  shockingly  is more leg room than even the front passengers have  At 6 0 quot  I was more than pleased Things I don t like  ground clearance  The truck I drove had the Off Road package  This includes two skid plates  one for the transfer case and one for the fuel tank  and a decal  With the size of this truck you think it would be perfect for doing a little trail riding  However  the  quot pumpkin quot  has only 8 quot  of clearance  I know  I know  that s what lift kits and 35 quot  tires are for  Little news for you  even 35 quot  tires look a little small on this truck Only other thing I don t like   parallel parking  Never had to do it  just wouldn t happen So if you re in the market for a work truck  a crew cab  or even a half price Hummer  this truck is for you br br  
Pos, Don t laugh  but I love my Ford Escort  I am currently driving my second Escort  purchased in 1994  I call her Trixie and she has carried me to and from work daily  on vacation and around town for the past six years  The odometer reads 67 973 miles but you need to add a digit to realize that it now has a total of 167 973 miles on it  Yup  167 973 miles and still putt putt  putting up the road  I put well over 100 miles per day on the odometer  not counting side trips  My first Escort lasted for seven years  so this one has already outlasted that one  All jokes and smug looks aside  anyone who has owned an Escort will tell you that they are a good little automobile  Replacing worn out parts is a fact of life  so I have never worried when I needed new brakes  timing belts or unfortunately a new transmission  A NEW TRANSMISSION YOU SAY  Yes  but it was no fault of the Escort  it my own negligence that caused that problem  I remember well the day the mechanic asked me when I had last had the transmission fluid changed and I replied  quot Changed quot  I think you can almost imagine the look on his face  The new transmission cost  1200 00  parts and labor  but it was well worth the money  I preferred to invest that money in my little car rather than to put it toward the purchase of a new auto  I consider it the same theory as paying for a heart transplant for a loved one  The mechanic who put in the new transmission even admitted that he liked the little Ford Escorts and said he had purchased one for his son to drive  He explained that he called them  quot disposable cars quot  because typically  owners of Escorts purchase them and drive them until they die along the side of the road  tires pointing up like poor little dead insects  Most Escort owners drive them until they have 200 000  miles on them  How many other auto owners can make that claim I love the size of my Escort since it is easy to maneuver  Living in Ohio  where our winters can deliver deep snow and freezing rain  the front wheel drive is a life saver   literally So  all in all  I am terribly disappointed that Ford has decided to stop making the Escort  I have no idea what I will purchase next  but then I guess I still have over 40 000 miles left to make that decision br br  
Pos, After 9 years and 196 000 miles it s time to retire the Escort 3 door  I cant say enough about this little car  I bought the car back in  94 for 13 000  After 9 years of commuting logging over 196 000 miles it s time for a new car  Why you ask  The family does not fit in this little economy car anymore  It s still running great and ready to go  The only repairs to this car over the years have been 1 wheel bearing  1 timing belt  1 battery  and the head light bulbs  I cant believe it  All these years and so few repairs  The ride of the little Escort is on par with most cars in this class  Handling is good at speeds even up to 90mph  The fuel economy is amazing  This little car was outfitted with the 1 9L in line 4 mated to a 5 speed manual transmission  The best highway mileage I have recorded is 41mpg on a trip from Reno NV to Salt Lake City UT  The air conditioning works great  although there is a noticeable lack of power when the air conditioning is on  The seats are comfortable for the day to day driving  but for the long trips bring a pillow  The controls are all located in right places  no hunting for missing controls  The trunk and fold down seats are perhaps the best feature of all  I used this car for commuting around the San Jose area as a Computer Networking consultant  For one particular job I needed to haul some computers to Oakland  I was stunned when I fit 11 computers into the back of this little wonder  Over the years this little car served me well and I would not hesitate in getting another one The stereo is not great  The little speakers that come in the Escort are junk  If you like music  go out and get some good speakers installed  The Transmission is great with one exception REVERSE  Sometimes reverse can be a little tricky to engage  This problem was present from the first day I got the car  Every mechanic I spoke to said this is normal for these cars  No big deal though  just put the car in first gear before you try to put it in reverse  Doing this will get the gears to line up  and reverse is ready to use  
Pos, I bought my Escort in 1997 with 48K on it  Now it has 88K and it is 7 years old  Still  it hasn t had any serious problems  I only had to change worn out brake pads and tires  that s it  Engine and transmission work like Swiss watch  It handles road very good  I don t feel any inconveniences with steering  The only problem  as one reviewer had mentioned  was icy condition  You d need to learn pumping breaks with your foot  I did not have any crushes on icy road  but I was close once  Some people consider automatic belts a nuisance  I even like them  Never got caught by a trooper with belts unfastened  Mounting a Christmas tree on the roof  though  creates a problem  Front seats have enough space for legs  but it may be a little cramped in the rear  Trunk is surprisingly large for such a small car  I have a hatchback  but my friend owns a wagon  which I think is smarter  He cannot be more happy about how much stuff he can load in his car Insurance  I pay  280 per year for liability only living in Cleveland area  The size of the car makes it quite unsafe  You can feel being blown from the highway when a large truck passes you  Also  bumpers are plastic  Sometimes it s hard to see what s ahead when an SUV is ahead of you  The position of the rear view mirror is totally wrong  My wife is short   she can see from under it  but I have to bend my neck each time I need to look to the right I general  the car is very good  You won t have to worry about someone stealing it  It is great to commute  Insurance is reasonable  It makes it excellent for students What else  Reader s digest rated Ford Escort 94 as a recommended used car 2000  
Pos, I grew up worshiping the quality of Japanese  German and Swedish cars  but I have to admit  my last few years driving this very inexpensive Ford have convinced me to consider another one the next time I need a new car  While it isn t much to look at  it has been immensely practical and reliable  I inherited this vehicle from my parents  and as a poor college student at the time I couldn t say no  despite its  quot grocery getter quot  nature  Now that I own a house  commute 20 miles to work in heavy traffic  and park in cramped lots  I appreciate its sizable cargo space  good gas mileage  and nimble handling  I recently recommended it to a friend and I recommend it to anyone out there who is looking for this type of vehicle  it is small and agile  with an excellent turning radius  it gets about 35mpg on mixed driving  can haul a lot more than you would think  and it s very reliable  Mine has 119k miles with only minimal maintenance  new belts and an alternator at 100k  and oil every 3 5k  It is a small car with a small engine  1 9L  so don t expect to outrun anyone  but it does have enough pickup for a normal driving  even in the aggressive Washington  DC traffic  The biggest problem  it s a station wagon and it looks like it  If you can swallow your pride  you ll save a lot of money with car br br  
Pos, We bought our car brand new four years ago  It was everything I wanted in a car  even the perfect color of green  We have an automatic with power windows  cd player from the factory  and air conditioning This car has been great  No major problems  We have had to replace the power window switch once  but other than that nothing major The only thing I would change about the car is something very simple and that is I would have a middle arm rest for the driver  Like I said that is something that anyone can live without The car has great pickup pulling out on a major highway and also does great up mountains At first I worried about having a two door when taking others on trips with us  If I were to buy another car today I would probably buy a four door  because it is a little hard for adults to climb in the back seat of the car  As far as leg room it seems to have plenty for four adults We have taken two other adults on many trips with us and never hear any complaints on the leg room Our car came with the extra stereo package which is great  It has a great sound to it The car rides very smooth and handles well I would recommend this car to anyone  In fact I just went with my little brother to buy his first car  He also got an Escort a 92 model and he also loves his Hope this helps   
Pos, I just want to say that I ve had my 1992 4x4 XLT fullsize Bronco for 4 years now and I love it  I couldn t ask for anything more in a vehicle  The first thing that sold me on it was the intimidating appearance of the thing  It looks mean  The interior is very roomy and comfortable and gauges and switches are clear and easy to reach  Currently it has 135 000 miles on it with not a lick of trouble  Everything on the Bronco is stock besides the 33 quot  tires and a Dynomax turbo muffler  The ride is decent for a truck like SUV  but the stiff suspension can really help out when off roading  The 5 0L powerplant is surprisingly powerful  I can beat my friend s stock Chevy Z71 0 60 even with my 33 quot  tires  although he hates when I bring it up  I don t see why people gripe and complain about the reliability of this vehicle  Me and about 8 of my other friends have gone over 120 000 miles on our Broncos  135 000 for me  without incident  I just think that some people don t know what the term  quot routine maintenance quot  means     
Pos, I had the opportunity to rent a fully loaded 4wd  4 0L  Edge edition Ranger supercab for 10 days recently  I was traveling through Northern California and camping in Big Sur with stops in San Francisco and Lake Tahoe Initially  I was surprised that the Ranger I d reserved was such a highly optioned model  I d been expecting a 2wd  3 0L V 6  extended cab model  Apparently this is the only way Budget equips Rangers rented from SFO  This was a pleasant surprise  but a surprise nonetheless  especially considering I d been quoted a rate of  18 00 day  Truly a bargain The white Edge edition is a sharp looking vehicle  with the performance to back up it s aggressive looks  The first thing I noticed when getting in was how stiff the seats seemed compared to my S 10 pickup  I felt like I was sitting in a truck  The lateral support seemed pretty much nonexistent  The interior was handsomely trimmed in typical Ford style  Driving the vehicle out of the garage one of the first things I noticed was a lot of tire noise from the knobby Goodyear Wranger RT S tires   This may not be the best long haul driver  I thought to myself During the course of more than 1000 miles of driving in various conditions including some off road runs around Big Sur  I found the truck to be a trusty friend  It corners competently on the highway  with the power to pass and accelerate from a stop quickly  Driving the winding roads on PCH around Big Sur  the truck felt solid and well planted  Switching to 4wd was a seamless affair with a simple dash mounted dial  The 5 speed automatic transmission was also faultless and very smooth The driving impression is quite different from my 1998 S 10  which feels so carlike in most driving situations  The Edge never let you forget it was a tall truck  The trade off for all the power was woeful gas mileage  15 17 mpg range  in all driving conditions  With gas costing  2 00 and more per gallon for regular in many California cities  it made for some painful gas stops  The 2 forward opening doors on the extended cab were very welcome  The chassis also seemed very tight and squeak free despite the large openings the truck s doors could provide  Anyone who has these 4 doors will wonder how extended cabs ever did without them Overall  I would say this is a very versatile vehicle with good looks and strong performance  The unremarkable seats  tire noise and poor mileage might make it tiresome to live with for some people  The 6 disc CD player also decided it wanted to keep my cds just before I returned the vehicle  I had to fiddle with it for more than 10 minutes before it decided to eject my cds  For the type of people in the Wranger  Xterra demographic  however  this is a great vehicle  
Pos, What does my Ford F 150 4x4 Offroad Have in common with Submarines  Airplanes  and 18 wheelers I ve flown my f 150 airborne many times  I ve driven in water over the hood I have the pictures  I ve towed overloaded Trailers  I ve chased coyotes through rough terrain  I ve loaded the truck with over twice the weight rating I even put in a supercharger and pushed the 4 6 liter overhead valve Triton V8 engine s power way past its design limits  It s been to the shop for oil  tires  brakes  plugs  a rear end oil seal  and one O2 sensor in 90 000 miles  We consistently choose our F 150 for Long trips over our 2000 F 250 and our 94 300ZX  It has the most sophisticated suspension of any truck I know Don t let that scare you  its been VERY durable  It rides like a Cadillac on the road  but handles bumps  rocks  mud  gravel  like a racing 4x4  It holds onto turns in a gravel road very well  Doesn t slide sideways The interior is very comfortable  Fully adjustable seats and steering wheel  Although the gauges are out of view with the steering wheel lowered all the way  The three door system and small rear seats are great for kids  but I wouldn t subject an adult to a very long drive back there  Colder air  it was 110 this summer  than the 2000 F 250 My biggest complaint about the drive system is the lack of limited slip  If you get one wheel in a muddy ditch  it will spin in the mud and rob torque from the other three  You can get an accessory that will eliminate the problem over  500 00  It does not have as much power or gas mileage as the Chevy  but generally  Ford does seem to forego power for reliability  and frankly  I d like it to last longer even if it isn t as fast About the  quot 4X4 Offroad quot  option  You get  17 inch wheels with recalled lug nuts  your wheels can fall off with the old ones two  quot 4X4 OFFROAD quot  stickers  A guard plate under the engine   quot Offroad quot  does have a higher book value and does sit up higher  but ask yourself if its worth the price  And remember  17 quot  tires can be hard to get and pricey br br  
Pos, My former boss had one of these precious trucks and she let me drive it  Well  I am originally a Chevy only type but when i took off in this particular truck i feel in love with it The feature that i like the most are the third door and the bench seat in the front and back are so comfortable  Its like a couch We hauled around a dozen kids  a soccer team  all day from game to game and they said it a smooth ride  From the cab when we went over rail road tracks it was very smooth  I gotta have it br br  
Pos, Ok  right off I love this truck  We bought the  97 Ford F 150 XLT shortbed  standard cab truck  and it was definitly worth buying  The price was very reasonable for the great quality we received It was used but the milage on it was very low  and the warranty had been extended for us for the term of the financing    Big Plus   It came with A C  ABS  both driver and passenger airbags  and another plus is that the passenger side airbag can be turned off    great if you have to fasten a car seat in the truck    We have had the truck almost a year now and it has been outstanding  No major issues at all  Because it is a truck it would not be good for families because of the lack of room  but this is an excellent work truck  Even on long road trips the seats are very comfortable  Driving it is a real pleasure  very responsive and handles well You want a good truck  go with the Ford F 150 br br  
Pos, If you are a person who needs an all around versatile vehicle  then the Ford F 150 Extended Cab pick up is what you want I recently purchased one  and it is the first full sized pick up I have ever owned  I have 3 children  and did not think a pick up would be a practical choice for me  considering the fact that you need room in a family vehicle for the entire family I had always borrowed a pick up from my families shop when I needed to haul a load of wood  hay  etc Much to my surprise  this pick up had MUCH more room than the sport utility vehicle I had previously been driving  and it has a third door  which completely erases the problem of trying to load kids  groceries  saddles  or whatever you need to put in the back seat  Three seatbelts in the back ensured the safety of ALL my children  and in front are 2 air bags  with a shut off for the passenger side air bag in case you have a fourth child The rear seat is also split  and can be folded down entirely or independently  depending on how much room you need  and when folded  it is a solid metal bottomed cargo area It has a V 8 engine  with a convenient switch to take you easily from 2 wheel drive to 4 wheel drive  it is the most comfortable and easy to drive vehicle I have ever owned  and I can haul anything  I haul wood  hay  wood chips  gravel  rocks the pretty kind  I am an avid rock hound  lumber  you name it  you have the room and the power to haul just about anything So the next time someone says   quot Pick ups are a mans work vehicle quot  you can say   quot Pick ups are for women and families too quot br br  
Pos, We bought our  97 F 150  Extended cab  XLT  Flareside  4x4  in 1998  It has the 5 4L V 8  We ve now had it for just over 2 years  We don t put much mileage on her and she just turned 4000 miles Our biggest complaint  is low fuel mileage  She s only getting about 10 2 mpg  That s all city driving It s roomy  sharp looking  runs great  probably not even broke in yet  and has plenty of interior room  Back seat folds down  so can use that area for cargo  without getting the seat dirty  The seats are comfy  the sound system is awesome It s nice to hit a button on the dash  to go into 4x4  rather than having to step out  to lock in hubs  That 5 4L V 8 has plenty of power  for towing a horse trailer  boat or r v We do love the look of the interior  but feel that Ford could use a little less plastic  for that caliber of vehicle br br  
Pos, I bought this vehicle along with my husband  his dream truck  and fell in love with it to  I couldn t believe that I  as a woman  older one at that  could find this  97 Ford XLT pickup  so comfortable and so much fun to drive  I find the control and driving real pleasureable and exciting  The only disconcerting thing is that I have to step up into it  I m just glad that it has handles to assist  The driving is just as easy as driving my Sable which is a power steering  The XLT has 4 wheel drive when you need it and it s easy to shift it into 4 wheel drive  I would recommend this truck to anyone  It s comfortable  fun  and easy to drive  even for a 50 year old bat like myself  I wouldn t say that a young person would appreciate all of the qualities of the XLT but I guess that s why they built them  quot Ford tough quot  even for an adventerous young person     
Pos, I bought my 1996 Contour used last June  My overall impression of the car is good  I bought the 5 speed because I think it is more fun and easier to control  especially in the snow  Front wheel drive also makes it great for snow driving  There are so many things I like about it  cruise control and tilt steering wheel dual airbags  ABS brakes  A C and power door locks  windows and mirrors  I guess what I am saying is that it has all the bells and whistles I like  I bought it because I wanted a larger car  I had a 2 door Neon  that was more comfortable  The seats in the Contour are so comfy  I test drove a brand new Escort ZX2  or something like that  the newest one  and sighed a huge sigh of relief when I got back into my Contour  This car is not a sports car by any means  but it has get up and go as well as comfort  There are a few things I would change though  one is the cupholder  yes  only ONE  it is pathetic and broken already  Another thing I would change is the mechanism to recline the seat  I have to roll it backward over and over to recline  same to put it upright again  A major waste of time  I would love my car more if it got better gas mileage  I average 25MPG  There have been several Ford instigated recalls for warranty repairs  however in my case they were all preventative as I have not had a single problem in the past 8 months  I did buy the extended warranty though  those bells and whistles get pricey to fix  I would say test drive one  you might like it br br  
Pos, My previous car was in the shop for repairs and I had to rent a car  1997 Ford Contour was what I rented and I really enjoyed  The car has a personality that I love to drive  While the price for a new car was out of my reach  I found a great value in a barely used 96 model  While the car doesn t have a large engine  it has plenty of pickup and handled large inclines easily  The only problem I found is head space  I am over 6 foot tall and it can become a little uncomfortable in long drives  The front wheel drive and stable wheelbase  makes it a easy car to drive and get through town to get the daily errands accomplished Update  August 2002 The car is now 5 years old and has 75 000 miles plus  The motor continues to run smooth and very reliable  The interior has held up and is in very good condition  The exterior is very good for this amount of use  I drive is daily  thus there are many dings and scratches from rocks and other debris in the road  The car has had a couple of recalls and Ford has fixed them quickly  Both recalls were for things that I was not experiencing  brakes and exhaust  The only negative thing to mention is the ride  Our other car is a 2001 Dodge Caravan  The smoothness of the Caravan makes the Contour seem alot rougher  Over a week may go by and I won t drive the van and the Contour seems very smooth  But then I drive the van and the I become less pleased  I would definitely recommend this car to anyone who is wanting a good car to last a long time  
Pos, The car is one of the best I have driven but if you live on a gravel road you are in for some surprises  The gravel roads tend to put the car to the limit  I have occasionally had to do some adjustments to the cars suspension system and had to rewire some of the wiring in order to get the car to perform the way it was intended  A few of the places that need to be fixed were the dash lights i had to put in a wire protector in order to keep the wires from wearing from the bumps on the road  The other problem i have had is with the courtesy lamp after about 1 year of driving it i had to replace it because the switch fused together and kept blowing fuses  The car I really don t think was meant for driving on gravel roads  Another problem is you have to constantly have to lubricate ALL hinges and locks in order to keep them from locking up and causing damage  These things are minor but they provide numerous headaches if you are not expecting them to happen     
Pos, Our lives were in the early stages of a complete overhaul  Well  not entirely  We were driving an old Corolla with nearly 200 000 miles on it and were becoming cramped  My wife was in the end stages of her first pregnancy and we wanted a minivan Truthfully  I hadn t even considered a Ford  no pun intended  I was focusing primarily on the Mercury Villagers  We wanted something with power  reliability  comfort  and a good look  Quite frankly  the Aerostar was not my first choice Aerostar s have a tendency to rust  I certainly don t want to drive a rust bucket  They seemed a bit bulky and their style never really changed in all the years of their manufacturing  It just wasn t the van I was looking for However  some friends of my parents were selling their 1994 Ford Aerostar Extended van  I just happened to be visiting my parents in Detroit and thought it might be fun to check out an Aerostar  I have to say that I was impressed  The van was a two tone maroon and tan  It had fiberglass running boards giving it a sort of solid   quot cruising quot  appeal  This Aerostar was clean and elegant The interior was customized boasting of quad captains chairs  plush carpeting  color TV  and oak trim throughout  The extended rear left plenty of room for strollers  pack n  play s  and luggage  Passengers found themselves in a comfortable situation without feeling cramped or inhibited I fired up the 4 0 liter V6 engine only to find it quiet and smooth  The van rolled down the road with ease and the acceleration left nothing to be desired  Handling was impressively good considering its size and shape  The odometer read only 68 000 miles  Needless to say  I bought it I have been very pleased with this van  Not long after I purchased it we packed it with seven people  an over abundance of luggage  and drove to Pittsburgh  There was plenty of room and the engine bolted up and down those steep Pennsylvania hills like a champ  My only criticism is the cost of repair  Though it is not scheduled for a tune up until about 100 000 miles it will cost me approximately  400 because of the compact engine compartment  I did have the drive belt replaced recently and it only cost me  36  I suppose  like most cars  the various repairs will balance out  This is a good vehicle and one that deserves consideration  I would buy another br br  
Pos, The F 250 is a great work truck  its also a great family truck  It has many options which include  Power windows and door locks  Quad Cab  four doors  Bed cover  Cd Player  Four Wheel Drive It is easy to work everything in this truck  Its roomy in the front and the back  It has a very smooth ride  This truck can tow a good sized travel trailer or a good sized horse trailer  I love the Four wheel Drive I probably have over 1 000 miles of four wheeling in this truck and I have never gotten stuck  Its a good truck for people who want the towing ability and also the roomy cab  It is big so I wouldn t recommend it for people who feel insecure about big vehicles br br  
Pos, Ok  I have reviewed the 97GT and the 89GT mustangs  but currently I can t locate any better place to post this opinion that might save you 1000  The intake manifold on the 1996 Mustang GT was made of a composite material  Unfortunately  the material was not strong enough to handle the horsepower of the V8  so at around 40 000 to 50 000 miles it cracked Intake manifold acts as a cooler where water and antifreeze circulates  You can probably drive your car for a few miles after there is no water in it  but its damaging and dangerous  You can even burn your engine doing this  And believe me  SOHC V8 does get hot  Ford recalled 1996 GT s and replaced the intake manifolds with more durable ones  which were used on 97 and 98 GT s If you do a research for a recall on your 96GT  you will find that there is one  Unfortunately  some of the 97GT s also came out of the factory with the weak manifold  There is no recall on the 97GT  and quite a few people have spent 1000 bucks on a new intake because of this Here is what Ford won t tell you  The intake manifold is really their problem  and even if your car is out of warranty  its their responsibility to replace it  If you own a 97GT  and your intake cracks  do not pay for a new intake  Take it to Ford  and tell them what happened  They will say that there is no recall on your car  Act like you know what you are talking about  and tell them you spoke to Ford and they said there is a  program  on the manifold  They will change it within a day at no cost to you  given that the manifold is indeed cracked  Make sure that it is  otherwise they will charge you 100  just for looking at it  Also  you can get the SVO supercharger or the aliminum SVO intake with a 500  discount if you loose your manifold  The supercharger is 3k  and will be dropped down to 2 5k   its worth about 100HP  The aliminum intake is worth about 20HP  and is a good base power mod if you are planning to go real fast in the future   ex  get a Vortech S  Trim  etc br br  
Pos, I m not exactly an unbiased author  I ve owned a corral of late model performance Mustangs that include a 1991 LX 5 0L  1993 Mustang COBRA  and a 1998 GT 4 6L  for my wife  I recently purchased a 2000 Performance Red GT  is there really ANY other color  to replace the  91 upon its mechanical demise  I researched the 2000 thoroughly and quickly discovered that its entry level invoice price was below all the other American vehicles of comparable size that offer styling or performance to match  such as the Camaro Z28  Pontiac Firebird  Pontiac Grand Am  Pontiac Gran Prix GTP   amp  Chevy Monte Carlo  Even factoring in a fully optioned GT  the price remained about  1500 below comparable models  When you see the  25k price on my Epinion  keep in mind that it is  25k out the door with every option available  My 2000 is a GT coupe with leather  auto  17 quot  wheels  and the Mach 460 sound system  Those are option packages provide all the extra stuff included with the option package price  the GT package gives you all the mechanical  amp  performance stuff to go along with the 4 6L  the leather group provides all the electrically adjustable seat controls  just for the driver  though  the 17 quot  wheel option gives you the bigger tires  amp  wheel locks  and the 460 package gives you all the extra speakers and cool stereo with CD  Virtually all Mustangs come with the  quot Power Equipment Group quot  which gives you the power locks  windows  steering  brakes   amp  mirrors  There s another  quot Convenience Group quot  which comes on virtually every Mustang which provides front mats  air conditioning  and rear defroster  The GT option also provides 2 new  since the 1999 2000 models  features for the Mustang  ABS  amp  Electronic Traction Control  The ABS is what you d expect  The ETC is a system that senses rear wheel spin on acceleration  now how would THAT happen  and uses the ABS system to apply the brakes to the spinning wheel and uses the Electronic Engine Control system to temporarily  quot de tune quot  the engine to stop it from revving up until the wheel stops spinning  It s definitely weird to experience the ETC system at work  but I guess it s a good thing  thank goodness it has an  quot off quot  switch  though  So   25k is about all you can spend on a well equipped coupe  the convertibles  amp  Cobras would require more money  I may have forgotten to purchase the lighted vanity mirrors  but if my wife can live without  em  so can I   that s got a genderist tone  doesn t it How s the performance  I was skeptical about the 4 6L s ability to carry on the Mustang s mystique and performance image  but I am consistently impressed  I am certainly no stranger to the push rod performance of the 5 0L  and though the 4 6L is considerably different in its personality  smoother  amp  silkier  its performance is every bit as respectable as its predecessor  Some people may dislike the 4 6 s decided lack of harshness typically associated with old school pushrod engines  but time marches on and the 4 6L will definitely win you over  As far as the modification potential of the 4 6L goes  I can t say as I am a bit of a lightweight there and usually stick to stock  Styling  In Performance Red  the heads turn  The 1999 2000 is a bit bulkier  amp  angular and more likely to appeal to the men  sorry if that s genderist  I didn t mean to be  but it definitely looks great from any angle  Exterior styling is always a matter of personal taste  so glance at a picture and see what you think  the car does seems to look better with more time spent looking at it The interior is a carry over with subtle refinements from the 1994 re style  It is modern without being quirky and very functional  Comfort abounds  and I really don t have any criticisms  You can visit one of those online car buying services  like carOrder com  and take their  quot 360  interior view quot  virtual tour for the Mustang  and what you see there is pretty much what you get  no surprises  From my vantage point  it is unchanged from my wife s  98  Interesting side note  Ford may be saving money by making leather available on only the front seating surfaces now  my  91 had 4 seat leather  And no option package has rear floor mats  so be prepared to shell out an additional  19 00 for them  Not a deal killer  but irritating  Other irritants  mild  for the interior include the lack of glove box light  I m nitpicking here  and the seat belt loops attached to the seat backs must go  I removed mine and I hope I can do that without compromising the safety or operation of the belts  Well  maybe now my forehead bruises from reaching into the back seats and banging into those stupid loops will heal  The rear seat back fold down trunk entry feature is a real plus  I guess I m getting older because I care about the stereo in a sports car  the Mustang s Mach 460 system is heaven  no complaints here  All in all  the interior is a comfortable  thoughtful  and handsome package irritants aside  Another interesting side note  for the money  the late model Mustang has always provided FULL analog instrumentation included in the base cost  That instrumentation includes a speedo  duh  a tachometer  temperature gauge  oil pressure gauge  fuel level gauge  duh again  and ammeter  All of this is presented in an attractive and properly placed cluster that avoids all of that stupid gimmickery that plagues less thoughtful vehicles  No digital stuff  excluding the odometer  that will burn out  blink  and stop working  No overly large speedo  temp  and fuel level gauges that are large in order to hide the fact that all 673 000 engine sensors are wired into a single  quot service engine soon quot   ok  I m GM bashing sorry  light  With the Mustang s gauge cluster  you can monitor the  quot traditional quot  engine conditions without worrying about a catastrophe coming without any warning  Hey  FINALLY the Mustang has a  quot low fuel quot  light Side view visibility is awesome now thanks to the revised roof line shape and the quarter window placement  That was a real hazard in the 1979 93 hatchback models  Speaking of hatchback models  I remain curious if I will eventually miss the convenience of the hatchback configuration  I think I will  The trunk access of the post 1993 models is not very good when put to the  quot luggage test quot  Perpetual  quot jockeying quot  of luggage items while half in and half out of the trunk is always necessary to get them in all the way  There s a low ceiling to the rear trunk area due to what I think is the rear speaker assembly  So  when you imagine you can shove tall items to the rear  you usually have to break out  quot Plan B quot  I would ve considered a hatchback model again if offered in a structurally rigid platform  The structural integrity of the post 1993 models is excellent and maybe maintaining that integrity was at least a partial concern in not making a hatchback  My  91 was a hatchback and never quite had that  quot new car quiet quot  feeling due to very small rattles that became not so small as time wore on  Speaking of rattles  there seemed to be numerous  amp  negative comments on the fit and finish of late model Mustangs  and I was curious as to whether I would be impressed or not with the assembly quality of my 2000  Well  suffice it to say that the comments seem to be warranted as far as my wife s  98 goes  Body seams are visually off  some of that may be due to what is ridiculously complicated styling in some areas  like the rear face  Her outer side support cushion on the driver s seat is breaking down  and there are some interior finishing strips that aren t adhered well  The car has 50k miles and is exactly 2 years old now  so maybe some of that is to be expected  I maybe thought Ford would ve come further since my  91  which shared some of that charming shoddiness  But the  91 was a  16 000 car  not a  23 000 one  Oh no  now I ll get all those economist emails reminding me to adjust for inflation or the GNP  You get the picture  though  My 2000 seems much tighter and quieter  and the body seams are excellent  So  maybe improvement has been achieved in that department Let s go driving  The 5 0L has a 4800 RPM  approximately  redline and the 4 6L has a 6000 RPM redline  That fact alone illustrates the difference in their personalities  The 5 0L launches off the line brutishly and pulls like a freight train while revving below 4500 RPM  The 4 6L has a constant pull that isn t quite as strong  but goes on and on  steady and strong  until 6000 RPM  So  the new ones take a little getting used to in the way of letting them rev up  Besides  there s nothing like hearing a V 8  even a small displacement one  smoothly rev up that high  The 2000 s exhaust note is awesome and a little lower than the  98 s  It has that great  quot throaty quot  quality and sounds very much like the 5 0L at idle  My muffler technician described the 5 0 Mustang exhaust as   quot one of the best looking  best sounding stock exhaust systems out there quot  The 4 6 s is just as satisfying  It combines the great throaty quality of V 8s with the loud growl of small displacement engines into a purely intimidating  and obnoxious  note  Great looking pipes  too  That s important  I m not GM bashing here  but is anyone at the company LOOKING at the exhaust pipes when they re designing the cars Handling is excellent as expected  The structural rigidity does wonders for enhancing the ride and the control  The 1979 93 models required you to do all the rigidity work yourself in order to get that kind of integrity  After doing all that reinforcement type of work  your car  well  mine at least  finally had that flat cornering   quot ride on rails quot  feeling  The new ones inspire that kind of confidence without the harshness  Hey  I m 36  and the harshness issue suddenly seems important  The 16 quot  wheels look a little lost in the large fender wells  the 17s look just right  I am a little dismayed at Ford s putting H rated tires on a GT  if you get the 16 quot  wheels  and making you shell out extra for a set of real tires  I think anything calling itself a performance coupe should have V or Z rated tires  at least  Keep in mind that in pure stock configuration  the GT can exceed the speed rating of H rated tires hmmmmm I m thinkin   quot Firestone 2   The Sequel quot  happenin  here For the mechanically curious  1  My GT has 5 000 miles on it now  and I ve been to the dealer once for warranty work on the rear axle carrier bearings  I don t know what I think of that yet  I had just been on a twisty N Calif coastal road where I thought I d see how spirited the car could get no abuse here  just alot of fun  The carrier bearings started making noise the very next day  defective set  did I break  em on my abuse session  are they of a weak design  I dunno 2  Gas mileage is at 22 1 with a 50 50 mix of town driving  amp  freeway raging  All town miles will yield just under 20  and all freeway  excluding stop and go commutes  will get you around 24  Not bad at all 3  The 4 6L is all aluminum  so beware of engine heat conditions  The warranty expressly excludes any damage due to overheat conditions  If you see the radiator warning light come on  stop immediately and get out the tow truck  The warranty also excludes damage due to lack of cooling system service  go every year to the dealer and get documented servicing of your cooling system Yea  there s faster  for a bunch more money  yea  there s better looking  a matter of taste  but no car crosses the performance styling curve with the dollar curve quite like the Mustang  It all comes down to value br br  
Pos, OK  folks  here we go  for any of you that have been around long enough to see the introduction of the Ford Mustang in 1964  officially released as a 1964 1 2 model  I feel sorry for you  Not because you re old  bad joke  please take no offense  but because you had to see the Mustang go through a radical transformation from a true muscle car to nothing more than an expensive Pinto in the late 70 s  to an underpowered GT car in the late 80 s  to an even heavier  quot sports car quot  in the mid 90 s  But with the introduction of the newest Mustang comes many improvements over the previous generations  beyond your wildest imagination  First off  I should say that this is finally a sports car again  It s got a revised 3 8 liter V6  and although still a pushrod engine  makes a respectable 190 hp that hurdles the 5 spd coupe 0 60 in 7 2 seconds  This torquey V6 makes lots of its power down low and has over 220 ft lbs of torque that makes driving a whole lot of fun  coupled with a new rear axle ratio  and rear wheel drive  But the real fun is in the Mustang GT  with the V8  Having the same displacement and sharing many of the parts with the former 4 6 L V8  it produces 260hp  up from the old 215 hp V8 in 1998  Coupled with the 3 27 performance axle  it flies to 60 mph in 5 5 seconds  and gets to the quarter mile in 14 seconds flat at 100 mph  To put that into perspective  the much revered 1986 Lamborghini Countach took a full half second longer in the 1 4 mile  Kudos to Ford for finally making a Mustang that for once looks good  Not since 1969 has a Mustang turned so many heads  They new edgy styling will last longer than the sedan like styling of the last generation  and finally makes it look like a sports car  Although the scoops on the hood and behind the doors aren t functional  they do give it a sharp appearance  The all new 5 spoke wheels on the GT model are classy and sporty  and coupled with the 245 45 ZR 17 s help the Mustang to achieve skidpad grips of  86 G s  which haven t been equaled by Mustangs before with the exception of the Cobra s  The Mustang rides surprisingly well for a sports car  The ride is supple  and firm enough to have appropriate and confident handling on smooth surfaces  However  because it still has a solid axle and hasn t updated its rear suspension to IRS  independent rear suspension  since its introduction  it can get a bit spooky on uneven  bumpy surfaces  Aside from that  handling characteristics are favorable  with mild understeer  The BFG Comp TA tires are sticky enough to handle most situations  while maintaining a smooth ride  Although there are so many things to praise about this car  it s far from perfect  In a world where Japanese standards of fit  finish and ergonomics have heightened the level of excellence  the Mustang falls short of impressing me  The dash is attractive  but the instrument cluster can look a bit dated at times  The fit and finish of the car have much to be desired  as well  By far the worst thing in the new Mustang are its seats  both front and rear  The front seats are  in a word  unsupportive  I d rather drive cross country in a VW Jetta than this Mustang  For short rides the front seats are fine  but long trips find your back and behind sore and aching  The rear seats  if you can call them seats that is  give you enough legroom if you re about 7 or 8  For real sized people  you might want to hitchhike  I would advise all sports car enthusiasts who love the feeling of RWD and gobs of torque to buy this car  especially the GT V8 Mustang  In case you re wondering  it can be fairly convenient  because the trunk has more than adequate space for storage  On that note  it can be attractive to more than just speed freaks due to its large storage space and ease of use  By the way  like I said before it s a real head turned  Guys and girls both like the styling  especially of the convertible  So if the old adage is true about dating someone for their car  you might want to consider this one br br

Pos, I love my 2000 Mustang  The car that I traded in was a 1992 Ford Mustang convertible  That car gave me a few problems  but I went ahead on and tried another Ford  I was looking for a new car because I was ready to get married  My husband went with me  We both fell in love with this car  I have a Bright Atlantic Blue Mustang  It is a pretty color  I don t see very many of the same color as mine  The interior is light gray and dark gray  The seats are light gray My car has only given me one problem  The air conditioner vents did not turn from side to side  I took the car to the local Ford dealership and told them  They looked at the car and ordered the parts  I took the car back in and they put in new air conditioner vents  This is the only problem I have had  The car is great  The interior of the car is a light gray  The car is an automatic  It has power windows  power door locks  cd player  tape player  cruise control  automatic driver seat  automatic mirrors  overdrive and It has an anti theft device built into the car  If someone doesn t have the right key  the car will not start  I had a key made at Wal Mart and it will unlock the doors  but you can t use it to drive the car with  It also has a remote control for the car  It has lock and unlock for the doors  trunk and panic button The driver panels are the speed  oil gage  temperature gage  gas gage and the battery  It also has lights that light up for different reasons  like the seatbelt  overdrive off  or low fuel  The seatbelt warning goes off every now and then  if you don t buckle your seatbelt up The gear shift is located in between the seats  It has park  reverse  neutral  drive  2  and 1  The overdrive button is located on the gear shift  There is a console in between the front seats  It has slots inside if for cd s  There is also a change tray located between the gear shift and the console  The doors also have  pockets  to place objects in  When I am out on the highway and I want to  get up and go  it goes  Some cars that I have had before if you push the gas it is still going the same speed  Not this one  You want to go  it goes  The car s body style has not changed much over the last few years  I has just been the head lights and tail lights that change  The body is just about the same as it was when they changed to this body style in 1994  The inside of the car is great  I love having the tape deck and the cd player  I have lots of cds but I also have quite a few tapes so that gives me more of an option of what I can listen to  The control panel for the cd player  the tape deck and the air conditioner are all in the middle  That makes it easy to get to for the driver The cruise control is located on the steering wheel  The buttons are cruise  coast  and resume  Cruise is to set it  Coast to slow down  Resume to go back to the speed that you were at before  The windshield wipers are on the side of the steering column  This is also the same as the blinkers and the headlight brightner dimmer  The emergency blinkers are on the top of the steering column  The headlights are on the left side of the steering wheel  There is an interior light for when the doors are open  When you get into the car and close the door  the light stays on until you start the car  This is very helpful at night time to see the ignition  When you get out the light also stays lit until you lock the doors  It also goes off automatically This car has an automatic window defroster for the back window  This helps in the winter time to defrost ice and snow  The heater has defrost  floor and mix  Mix is the floor and defroster  The heater air conditioner is a round circle that goes from cold to hot  blue to red  The air conditioner has max a c  normal a c  and vent  The max blows a little harder than the normal  Vent is just for outside air  The only thing that I don t like is that the seats could be a little softer than what they are  I love the automatic seat for the drivers side  There is not one on the passenger side  But they are ok  The front seats are bucket seats  The back seat is two different seats  They lay down to the inside  In case you have something in the trunk  There is not much leg room in the back seat  It is comfortable enough for my son  He is only five  so he is comfortable in the back seat  Most adults would not be comfortable in the back seat  unless they are short  I have ridden in the back seat  I am 5 5  and there is enough leg room for me  But it is not for very tall people The trunk has an automatic opener on the key chain and also inside the glove box  There is also a safety feature on the inside of the car s trunk  There is a cord to pull in case you get locked in the trunk  to pop the trunk from the inside  The trunk is carpeted and has the donut tire underneath the carpet  It is a pretty roomy trunk for a sports car  My car has a spoiler on the trunk  There is a third brake light in the spoiler This car drives great  The car accelerates when you want it to  It is a fun little car to drive  The brakes also work well  When you need to stop and stop fast  it does  The cars performance driving is great  It takes off and slows down when you want to  It handles the road good  It is easy to drive  I love everything else about my car  My next car after this one will more than likely be another Mustang  They have me sold on this  little pony  If you have not ever had a Mustang you need to drive one  You might really want one after you do  Thank you for reading  Have a good night Kimberly 
Pos, Let me start with one comment  I have always wanted another Mustang  owned a  69 10 years ago  It came time for the family to purchase a second car  Since we were already in possesion of what I believe to be the best sedan in the world  a  94 Honda Accord EX  I decided that rather than go with the SUV  living in the Midwest  this makes more sense  I would get ME a car I ordered a 2001 GT Convertible 5 Speed manual  After an incredibly long delay waiting for Ford to build my car  it finally arrived early summer  This car is the ultimate summertime vehicle  Drop the top and go  With the optional Mach460 sound system you will have no problem hearing your favorite tunes as the wind whistles by I am by no means any kind of motorhead  so don t look for performance figures or anything else like that in this opinion  But I do enjoy being behind the wheel and after 16 years of driving I am still trying to figure out how I never truly experienced driving until getting behind the wheel of this car  There is tons of power in the V8 engine  the seating is comfortable  even for a tall man and there is surprising room in the back for 2 young children  I realize that I will have to give up the car by the time the kids hit 10 or so  but until then  the whole family enjoys it You re not going to be taking this car to the grocery store  or anywhere else that requires putting anything in the trunk  There s room for a set of golf clubs  barely  and that s about it  so forget hauling groceries For all of the power  the car handles remarkably well too  as long as you are on dry pavement  Any little bit of moisture on the ground and look for the rear tires to slip  even with traction control on  I fear that this car will spend a lot of time in the garage during the winter months as I imagine the snow traction to be non existent I could give you about 100 reasons to NOT buy this car  but instead I will give you the 1 reason to buy it  It is FUN br br  
Pos, Ford did a brilliant job when it created the mustang  It is sleek and powerful  Just driving the car can make anybody feel young again Mustangs come in three varieties  standard V6  GT version  and SVT  Generally it correspods to what type of engine you get  the latter being the more powerful  The best part about owning a mustang is that the interior of the mustang Base V6 is the same as the GT or the SVT save the emblems  You don t feel like you are getting the base model  it feels like your getting the best model I own a 97 v6 mustang and my roomate has a 99 SVT  We both love our mustangs  We know that not many other cars can keep up with us  Say a mustang vs a civic  or a mustang vs a prelude  I think for the price the mustang is the best car out there  Just knowing there is something powerful under the hood and the car is not just looks is one of the things that make a mustang great When driving a mustang  the whole sports car feel is there  A stiff suspension  a nice sounding engine  and a instument panel that has gauges for everything  One thing though  It would have been better if the mustang had four wheel independent suspension  but it still handles very well The mustang is not as quiet as say a lexus  but it isn t supposed to be  You are supposed to hear the roar of the engine when driving a sports car  The sound only adds to the effect Only people who can picture themselves in a sports car should buy a mustang  One thing though  you must be sure of your driving skills because one your behind the wheel you will really want to drive it br br  
Pos, The new generation ford contiues in the greatness of the ford line  The new styling is both aggresive yet civilized  The standard engine the V6  is still very powerfull but to opt for the 260 horse power V8 in the GT is a worthwhile purchass  The convertable has no problems  No leaks or tough situations for up or down movement  The mustang has incredible road manners  With plenty of power and tourque it has passing power on the highway  And a great drive through country winding roads  The car handles quite well for seating 4 adults  The two in the back are a little uncomfterble The trunk space is quite large because of the hatchback design of the car  Holding about  8 on the skidpad is a very good score  The mustang is a car that can be owned by anyone  For the exectutive or the person just looking for some style  The only down side to the mustang is its rear wheel drive  In the winter snow can cause a small problem  but wiht the available traction control deep snow is the only problem  The mustang is a great car for anyone  And with a low sticker price and high performance rating it is a great deal     
Pos, If your in the market for a great ford car  and you want a convertible  get this car  The 1999 model edition is the best one yet  The top folds down quicker than ever  and the car has been made ven more powerful  The hp is about 250  The car also sounds great  with the classic mustang sound  This car also excelerates extremly well  and can beat out 17 year old s anyday  The car is very appealing in yellow  and where ever you go people will tur their heads and look at this amazing car  When people see this car  they wish to themselve s I wish I had that car  Over all this is a great car  and everyone should get it br br  
Pos, I drive a 2000 Mustang V6  This car gives you a lot of bang for the buck  The hood  bumpers and trunk are of a composite material which means they will not rust  It also makes the car lighter  The good part is the winter won t rust the car out  but the car is lighter   for winter driving  with this car being a rear wheel drive  put some weights and get good winter tires  if you are to drive it in the snow  Of course rear wheel drive is fun though  for going around corners The car handles well and is a dream to drive  The seats are comfy  and adjust well  The gages and interior is basic  but doesn t give you that  cheap  feel  like a typical GM car  Sometimes the dash squeaks  but only rarely  The sound system is good  even with the basic system The air conditioning is VERY good  and so is the heating  The back seat is short and not comfy for people taller than 5  4 The V6 will not win you an Indy 500  but the gas mileage is very good  and another thing   this car is sexy  You can also spend more money like any other car  but the aftermarket for the Mustang is awesome there are a lot of toys you can buy to make your Stallion fly Don t let anyone tell you Ford is junk  Ford has their problems  but so does GM  Toyota  Honda and whoever else  The difference with this car is that it is easy to get parts for  and cheap to repair  Nobody should laugh at you for owning a Mustang  Not everyone wants a rear wheel drive sports car  but if you re looking for something fun take a look  
Pos, Why did I buy a 2000 GT Mustang well first I owned a 1969 Mach1 Mustang for the last 6 years and I can not tell you how much fun I had driving it This car made me a  quot king of the road quot People would stop traffic to let me out of parking lots parking spaces and even to exit driveways I think they just wanted to get a glimpse of American automotive history The Mustang is more than just a vehicle It is a symbol of who you are I love the way people would give me the thumbs up when they pulled up next to me or the stories they would share with me at car shows about their Mustangs that they owned or own They spoke about them as if they were a part of the family and that s how I felt about my old Mustang The most common phrase I hear is  quot I should never have gotten rid of my old Mustang quot  Well when it came time to purchase a new car I had plenty of choices but I knew I wouldn t be truly happy unless I was behind the wheel of my true love the Ford Mustang  As for driving one my test drive of the standard shift 2000 GT at the dealership was very pleasing The sound of the engine as I let the clutch out and drove out of first gear was so smooth and pleasing The power was on tap at all times Braking was excellent The all four disc brakes were a first time experience for me and I loved it The handling was quite nice Sharp turns were point and execute no questions asked I felt like the car was built around me in the drivers seat Everything was within reach Excellent view of the road front and rear  I can t wait for my new Mustang to arrive from the Dearborn Assembly plant I think I made the right choice Heck I know I made the right choice Mustangs are for anyone who wants fun performance and a little bit of American automotive history of their own As I tell all the Cheverolet lovers The STAMPEDE is louder than the HEARTBEAT br br  
Pos, I have owned my 2000 V6 Stang for 6 months now and am loving it more every day  What an awesome car  There really is just something about a Mustang  Especially one that is powerful  beautiful and sounds like thunder  I added about  600 in add ons to my stang   GT dual exhaust and a cold air intake   MAC Products   It was awesome before but now it s even better  It sounds and feels like a hot V8 and is quite a bit faster that stock V8 s of only a couple of years ago  I have owned 30 cars 2 of them were imports and I have had 2 transmissions go out out on those 30 cars  the 2 imports  American cars are just as if not more reliable than most imports plus you get style and great driving experience  Plus it would survive a wreck better most My 2000 Stang is the most awesome car to drive that I have ever owned and it only cost me  17 000  with leather plus  600 in add ons  About half the price of most comparably powered imports  I am not blind to the negatives though  Engine a bit noisey at higher rpm s but when blended with the rumble from 3 quot  dual exhaust it s just fine  Probably should get upgrade to 16 quot  or 17 quot  wheels from the V6 stock 15 quot  but not really necessary  I love the 5 speed and with it it weighs 270 lbs less than a GT with automatic and 240 lbs lighter than a V6 Camaro with nearly the same HP  GT s feel heavier and I know they would be awesome to own   and to upgrade   but for  3500 less money I ll stick with my nimble V6 and have fun upgrading it here and there  Supercharger  Who knows  maybe someday br br  
Pos, In March of 2003 I drove from Ontario Canada down the I 75 to Fort Lauderdale Florida to purchase my 2000 V 6 laser red Mustang Convertible  I am in no way a Mustang fanatic  in fact I know very little about Mustangs  I do know enough about mustangs that I love all of the retro touches on the new body style  When you put my 2000 beside an old 1965 you can easily see the inspiration for the design  I made the long drive to find a perfect and rust free used Mustang convertible and the car is worth every mile of my trip  My laser red Mustang is an auto with beige leather and power everything with a beige top  Every time I drive this car I find myself appreciating it a little more  The V 6 has plenty of power for any kind of legal driving and will still pull hard out of the corners  The 4 wheel disc brakes are smooth and powerful  The power top works great and is quick enough to put up at a red light  although it does leak a bit in a heavy rain  I guess that s just part of owning a convertible  I put this car away for the winter  so I can t comment on winter traction but in the summer the stock Goodyears do an excellent job The V 6 does lack the deep growl of the V 8 and the rear end looks much better with the dual exhaust  A new exhaust may be comming next season  The little 15  rims and tires bother me a bit on my V 6  There is too much room between the wheels and the fenders  it looks like a 4x4  Next up after the dual exhaust will be to find a good set of used 17  GT rims and have the suspension lowered  which is an inexpensive job  My wife and I have a 3 year old and the car seat fits nicely in the back  My daughter loves the convertible and begs to have the top down  I put her in after I put the top down  and I find it easier to lift her in than putting her into out 4 door truck  The back seat is really only suited for kids or a duffle bag Having said all that  there really is no other feeling like driving the classic American muscle car with the sun and the wind  I would never have considered this car as a hard top  If you re going to put up with all the inconveniences of a tiny sports car  it had better reward you with the top down experience  
Pos, I walked into the Ford dealer near my house and saw this beauty  It was a Ford Mustang Gt  Red with black racing stripes on the hood and leather interior  I thought to myself for about 3 seconds then made a decision that I must have this car  Its absolutely beautiful and its an experience to drive each and everytime I get behind the wheel  Everyone stares at it and not to be a materialistic but it feels good to have something that people admire  It has a 4 6 liter engine V8 and it s power is unbelievable  I had other sports cares but this one tops all of them in the area of comfort  I absolutely adore this vehicle and recommend it to anyone with class and a desire for excitement and a little fast paced fun  The only bad thing is the gas  but i m willing to overlook that negative quality and again I will say you only live once so have fun and take chances br br  
Pos, To me  this is what Mustang was originally supposed to be about a fun to drive car  comfortable on longer trips  available with a peppy engine that gets reasonable gas mileage  I have the 190 hp six cylinder this car is nice and stable at high freeway speeds  feels heavy and solid on the road  handles well  and seems so aerodynamic  I love mine Laser Red  automatic  4 wheel ABS  good sound system  standard  nice cloth seats  I like a sports car that is still attainable to most of us  that is still in the average American budget Plus  this car is back to what the Mustang was all about too many of our American cars became bloated machines that were nothing like the originals both the Mustang and the Thunderbird come to mind  I love both of these cars though I can t see myself absolutely giving up the rear seat  as in the Thunderbird for 2002  I love the Mustang  my own personal car for zipping around  with a usable rear seat  nobody said HOW usable  but usable br br  
Pos, For years prior to actually getting a drivers license  I have adored the classic  65 Ford Mustang Convertible  How could I refuse to love those curves  that massive design  that glistening red paint  and that spacious  leather interior  It was the car of my dreams  from the moment I fist lay eyes on it  Yes  I admit it  I was one of the many victims suffering from Mustang Madness  I vowed that I would buy that classic car and have it rebuilt and restored as soon as I could drive As the years went by  and Ford produced a new Mustang after Mustang that failed to inspire me  I remained true to the classic  65 model and I counted the days until I could have one  Now that the time to buy a car has rolled around  Ford comes out with a stunning new look to the old classic  This brand new classic in the making has the fine contour or a machine built for speed  instead of the luxurious comfort of the  65 version  When the brand new Ford Mustang first caught my eye  I knew I was in trouble  How could I stay true to the classic when this red  convertible  speed demon had hold of me  One look at this beautiful piece of American car and I  like many people  was hooked Ford has finally redesigned the Mustang to do the classic justice  Even though it was difficult to push the classic aside  I am thrilled to see that the Mustang is back with a vengeance     
Pos, Are you contemplating the Mustang  I know I know  it is a Ford  But  if you can get past that you won t be sorry The only model I can write about is the GT Convertible  loaded  In my never humble opinion it is the only way to go  Now we will assume that you are  a over the age of twenty five and  b under the age of fifty  otherwise your insurance bill will exceed Sadam Hussein s hooker tab or you are too old to be seen in such a I hope I don t look too old kind of car This car is not cheap but it does move  It is not a stealthy car  can you say highway patrol trooper but chics like  em  It doesn t get thirty miles to the gallon but the fuel tank holds plenty  You won t want to drive on go out with your buds night but for just you or one companion it can t be beat There is no equal for this car in speed and handling for the money  And you may even find that the famous Ford reputation for unreliable poorly screwed together vehicles does not apply to the Mustang  And  by the way  this is by no means a limited production car  they build a zillion of them so you can strike a hard bargain     
Pos, I pull up to the stop light and next to me I see a Porsche Boxster  But you see if I were in any other car I would sit back and stare in awe but I was in my brand new 2000 GT Mustang  This guy in the Porsche was over there thinkin look at this guy thinking he s got a fast car  well I m going to burn him  But when the light turned green i was gone before he could say a word  I love my mustang  I have loved mustangs since they came out  They have always been reliable cars and so far my 2000 has proved to be reliable also  The mustang is one of the sharpest  sleekest  best lookin cars on the road today  The style and performance is unbeatable for the price  If you are lookin for bang for the buck then this is the car for you  I got this car because I wanted a fun reliable car to drive around everyday  I got both out of the mustang  If you are single and want a good car for good money the Mustang is for you br br  
Pos, The new 2000 Ford Mustang GT is an awesome car  I own the car in Performance Red the new color for the 2000 Model year  The car is everything a person could want  It has a nice 4 6 Liter V8 engine with 260 horsepower  The 0 60 in this beast is in the low 5 s  The only thing I don t like about the car is the back seat  but since I am the owner of the vehicle I don t sit back there  The space in the back is kind of small but it can still fit 4 comfortably  The thing I like about this car is all the looks that you get in it  It s awesome  Also if you are a big car fanatic like myself then there are so many different things that you can do to your car to make it different than others  A new option also on the 1999 and 2000 models is Traction control which really does help  I have noticed a tremendous difference which its on  The options i got on my car was a 2000 Ford Mustang GT  Leather Interior  5 Speed Manual  and other options  I just recently purchased the car and I Love it  I paid just under  30 000 for it  Overall experience with the car is I am 110  satisfied  I recommend this car to someone that loves cars br br  
Pos, I ve read all of the other reviews posted for the 2002 Expedition and I m amazed that most of the reviewers don t even own one  yet are compelled to write reviews that are nothing more than retyped spec sheets from Ford Take it from an actual owner   this is a great vehicle to drive  I have an Eddie Bauer 4WD version that I bought new in January 2002  It is so much fun to drive  I actually find myself looking for extra trips to make to the store just to drive it I ve had all the seats full of people  seats 8 comfortably and I ve had it filled with lumber and other cargo  Either way  it s 5 4L Triton V8 pulls it easily  In May  I used the tow hooks on the front to pull my brother s SUV  Olds Bravada  out of a swampy mess  Let me also tell you that at that time  his Bravada also had a 20  pontoon boat and trailer hitched up to it  It was up to it s axles in mud  yet the Expedition gracefully pulled it right out  without even breathing heavy at all  I then towed the boat about 40 miles over hilly country roads and often forgot that the boat was even there because it handled it so effortlessly Now  I don t plan on using it like that too often  but it was nice to know that it could handle it  My main objective with this vehicle to have comfortable seating for several passengers  I need more passenger room than I could get with smaller SUV s  so I only considered the Expedition and the Yukon Tahoe  I love GM products  but the Expedition costs about  5K less when similarly equipped  To those who suggest getting a mini van  I can only suggest that you quit making suggestions  This SUV  even if it never touches the off road environment  is the classiest and most comfortable way to travel  The added confidence of 4WD for winter driving makes any mini van just a glorified station wagon that is best suited for picking up groceries If you re reading this  you re probably already aware of the spec s for the Expedition so I won t retype them  What I will point out to you is that the Eddie Bauer is the only way to go  For about  4K more than an XLT  you get the 5 4L engine  leather interior  seat warmers  MACH audio system  digital temperature control  exterior trim package  very nice  and lot s more  I got mine with 18  chrome wheels and I have to say it s the only way to go One extra that was included on mine was the reverse sensing warning system  A  200 option  but worth lot s more  It has saved me on a couple of occasions by warning of obstructions behind me  and is a great companion for when I back the truck into the garage  yes  it just barely fits in my garage  I can easily back in and pull within 10 inches of the wall every time  just by listening to the beeping tones of the warning system  Make sure you get this option I m getting 13 1 mpg on a combined hwy city style of driving  Not so great on the wallet  but that is what you have to pay if you want a big SUV  It s no worse than any other large SUV  And the other issue about insurance costs   well  it s true that you ll be safe in an accident  but whatever you hit will likely be destroyed  But  isn t that the way you would want it  I know that I want my wife and new baby to be safe in case of an accident  so if it means an extra  100 for insurance  so be it  Your insurance costs are a direct reflection of your driving skills  so all of those reviewers that talk about high insurance costs must have some amazingly poor driving records  Of course it s going to cost them more if they re a bad driver behind the wheel of a bulldozer SUV like the Expedition  After you ve driven it for a week or two  you ll find that it s not very intimidating to drive after all  and the turning radius is really quite surprising To conclude  I will say that I love this SUV and will not part with it  Take it from someone who actually owns one  and disregard all those Pulitzer wannabees out there that have nothing better to do than write reviews about vehicles that they don t own  For 2003  Ford has added a new suspension that allows for the third seat to fold down flat  which is the only thing that I would love to change about my 2002  It would be so nice to be able to fold it s third seat out of the way instead of having to remove it and stash it in the garage before running to Home Depot I hope this review was helpful to you  
Pos, Let me explain to you in detail what I have before I review the car  I own a silver 1992 5 0L HO Mustang GT  I bought the car used and I am the third owner of the car  The car has been taken care of really well  which enables me to make an accurate review of the car itself  The engine is a stock Ford 5 0L HO engine with the exception of new headers and under drive pulleys  The radiator has been replaced with a 3 core radiator  The suspension has been modified with adjustable shock  you can adjust how smooth or tight you want it to ride  My review is with the setting to  3  being the middle  The settings are  1  for smooth ride and  5  for tight ride  The radio has been replaced with a JVC CD deck along with a trunk mounted 12 disc CD changer  The exhausts have been replaced by Steeda with high flow exhausts but are not the straight pipe ones you ve all seen on the road  These on the outside look like the standard ones which almost hide underneath the bumper  They are called Steeda  Whisper  exhausts for reference purposes Ok  first of all  let me address the so called  Whisper  exhausts  Let me tell you that I am completely clueless on why they call them that  the car is in no way quiet  Instead it sounds like pure muscle  not like I m complaining  it s a beautiful sound Anyway  on with the car  The car comes standard with a 5 0L HO Ford V8  Which I must say is a fine piece of machinery  Even though compared to today s 4 6L V8 which puts out 260hp  the 5 0L s 225hp might seem very modest  However  don t disregard it just yet  The 5 0L engine gives out more than enough power on a wider range than a lot of cars I ve driven I will explain what I mean by this  but first I want to clear something up about engines and power  When they give you a horsepower rating  they should give a corresponding rpm number  This is the revolutions per second the engine is turning  The reason for this is that depending on how fast the engine is turning  the number of horsepower is different  Obviously the higher the rpm the higher the horsepower  However  with some cars that advertise a great amount of horsepower or a great amount of torque  they usually mean at an extremely high rpm  such as 6000 or above  This horsepower is almost useless in initial acceleration  Most Japanese small engine cars that try to advertise ridiculous horsepower numbers use this technique  read into it further and you ll find that it ll be at those extremely high rpms which is close to redline and can damage the engine if brought to it enough  The main problem with this is that most of the horsepower and torque won t kick in until the engine is spinning so fast  So basically anywhere before that you won t feel barely anything The engine in the Mustang  however  is different  I ve found that I m stuck to my seat from the very beginning all the way up to 70mph or more  I did this little test one day on an empty turnpike  The speed limit was 70mph  so when I stopped to pay the toll  I floored it coming out of the toll plaza  The car returned excellent response all the way up to 70mph  This means the car has a really good midrange  which is the best to have The interior looks fairly nice  the instrument panel is fairly well arranged and I like the inclusion of an oil level gauge  Most cars have this by now  but like the car I had before  a 1990 Acura Integra  some cars didn t  Some things I don t like about the interior is the plastic  A lot of the dash is plastic  and that bothers me  it s so cheap feeling  However it isn t especially cheap or nasty looking  so that s not too bad  but I would prefer at least vinyl  There is some vinyl though  The middle storage box is very small  and doesn t really hold much  mainly just a pair of sunglasses and the little remote for my CD player  Also it is positioned too far back  you have to bend your wrist a lot to reach the button and to flip it open  then you d have to look down and back to see what s inside to know what to get  Also  I don t like how the trunk release button is located inside the glove compartment On the positive note  there are enough good things about the features to let you overlook some of the slight annoyances of the interior  After 1991 airbags were required as standard  so the 1992 Mustang obviously has one  which is a little reassuring after driving the 1990 Acura without an airbag for so long  Also  it has power windows  power locks  power steering  power brakes  cruise control  everything  And also everything works  As long as it has been maintained  everything should still work even after 10 years Mine is an automatic transmission car  It has all the standard settings but unlike the Japanese cars have the overdrive feature too  I kind of hoped they would switch the placement of the overdrive with the regular drive  The way they have it configured now is  from top to bottom  Park  Reverse  Neutral  Overdrive  Drive  1st gear  I m used to simply counting the number of notches when going from setting to setting  I m used to one notch down for reverse  then two more notches down to get into drive  now I have to go three  That s not too horrible of a problem  but the fact is  regular drive would be used more  so it should come first  The way it is now  is that when I m in drive  the two most likely settings for the shift to accidentally get knocked into is overdrive and 1st gear  Slipping into overdrive while driving is no big deal  but if I would accidentally knock it to 1st gear I can probably majorly damage the transmission  especially if I m driving fast  which isn t hard to do in this car  Another thing that I don t like about the shifter is that there is no display on the dash what setting you re in  I liked it when I can see on the instrument panel what I m in instead of having to look down if ever I m unsure  However  these are easily overlooked  they are just the little annoyances I ve noticed The automatic transmission works pretty efficiently  In regular drive  you ll be able to feel the car very accurately  The transmission  like all other automatics  would  kickdown  a gear when it senses the gas pedal is depressed harder or more  The only thing is that at the higher gears  it tends to not want to kickdown unless I REALLY step on the gas  However with this motor kickdown at the higher gears is not really required to get decent acceleration  but it s there if you really need it On overdrive  it drives identical to the regular drive on all speeds under about 50 55mph  After that point  it will go into overdrive  In overdrive you ll notice that the car will have very little acceleration response  This is because it is trying to be more fuel efficient  Despite the lack of acceleration response  this setting is really nice on long trips  since at overdrive it accomplishes 70mph with only 1500rpms from the engine  which is down right incredible  Normally in my Acura Integra the engine will be spinning at about 3500rpms to get up to 70mph  This big HO engine gives almost no effort at 70mph  That is especially good not only for gas mileage but for the life of the engine  The more stress the engine is put through the shorter the life will be  With the 5 0L HO engine you don t need to worry about that since it requires little effort to get the same speeds accomplished by Japanese sports cars I really don t have to speak of the exterior  anyone who sees my car immediately compliments me on how beautiful it is  Some people might not appreciate it as much  but in good condition it just simply looks good  The front has very bold designing with the large hood area and the flat  mean looking front including the awesome looking round fog lamps on the bottom From the side you notice the ground effects the most  Most people have mistakenly thought that I put a body kit on the car  They don t realize the car needs no body kit  it looks that good stock from Ford  The car is sitting on aluminum alloy 16  rims  which for that year is the newly designed 5 point star design in opposed to the 1990 and before  turbine  style 15  wheels The rear of the car is a hatchback design  This is where most of the complaints lie  I say MOST  but that s out of very few total complaints  you generally don t hear very many negative points on the Mustang GT s body design  The rear of the car is quite small  The rear wheels are almost sitting at the corners  However they executed it quite well  One of the first things you notice about the back is the big spoiler rear wing  This  unlike the ones you see on Japanese cars teenagers customize  is a functioning rear wing  It directs some of the air flow up and outward to put slightly more pressure on the rear wheels at high speed to maintain grip and to provide better grip on the rear wheels during braking  On rear wheel drive vehicles  you will definitely need this That is why tire manuals would instruct for the new tires to be placed on the back wheels despite what most people think  even if it is a front wheel drive car  The reason for this being  the last thing you want is to lose grip on the rear wheels  If you ever lose traction of the rear wheels your back end would get lose and you ll probably go into a spin The brake lights  indicators  and reverse indicators are all packaged together in a group covered by a grill like design so the light goes through in many tiny slots  It s hard to explain  but it is very attractive  and like the body kit mistake  a lot of people mistaken this as a custom thing done to the rear light  but this is the way the car comes stock from Ford The sound of the car is also excellent  I ve heard 5 0L Mustangs with the standard exhausts and they sound decent  but the real magic of the 5 0L engine is best expressed with hi flow exhausts such as the Steeda exhausts or the ever popular Flowmaster exhausts  The sound of the Ford 5 0L HO engine is actually REALLY distinct  A trained ear can easily tell a Mustang from other sports cars even ones with similar sized engines  It is not that annoying weed whacker sound you hear from the big exhaust tips  or  cherry bombs  you see so much of these day  instead you can hear the rumble of the engine and the separation between the firing of different pistons  and it s a GREAT sound  reminds you of the muscle car age back in the 60 s and 70 s All in all  it is really unlikely to find such a great combination of all features for such a great price  The car combines all out muscle with some nice features to be more practical  The ride comfort is not at the level of being a luxury car  not at all  it feels really distinctly like a sports car  but at the same time does not discomfort you while doing so  The car is a little annoying to get over speed bumps due to how low the car is  and there is the occasional squeak you ll hear when going over a bumpy road  but otherwise the sheer excitement of driving such a car will make you forget all of that  All of the extra comfort features are also very welcome in this sports car as well  Cold AC  power everything  cruise control  and hey  it even has a back seat for your friends  although not really big and roomy  is similar to the Integra I had before  so no big complaint there  If you can find one in good condition  don t hesitate to buy this car  Make sure to get it checked out at a mechanic s first because it has been 10 years  a lot can have happened to it  But if maintained well  this can give you years of excitement  and compliments b Update  11 17 02 b  Well  it s a bit more than 6 months since buying this car  so this is an update on my opinion on the car based on more experience  and I must say I will still back up everything I ve said and much much more  It has met all my expectations and more  First of all  I scrounged through the receipts from Steeda and I found that the previous owner had installed Steeda Sport Springs which effectively lower the car and the center of gravity  That would explain why I scrape the bottom of my car everytime I go over a speed bump  and I go REALLY slow too  Well since buying it I ve had to give the car a major tune up  replacing such parts as all the spark plugs  spark plug wires  distributor cap  water pump  serpentine belt  and the fan clutch  This might seem like a huge list of parts  but most of it besides the waterpump and fan clutch is part of the tune up and other preventive maintenance  The thing that really stands out is the costs  For my old car  the Acura Integra  a new distributor cap would have run as high as  150  On the Mustang  the brand new distributor cap was  20 and change  This was basically the case with everything else  To get the waterpump and serpentine belt replaced was less than  200 total including parts  labor  and tax  If I was to get either the drive belt or timing belt and the waterpump replaced in the Acura Integra I would have been looking at a good  500 or more job  So owning a popular American car has really saved me a lot of money  Cars like the Chevy Camaro and the Ford Mustang are so common and simple that there are a huge array of aftermarket retailers that deal in parts and upgrades for them  Thus  extremely low costs Also  I cannot really make mention of anything illegal such as street racing  so I ll have to say  I haven t been involved in any illegal street racing  However  you and I both know that when you own a Mustang  you re going to get challenged at the stop light  it s inevitable  by every rice boy in town  and eh hem  I can t say I ve officially raced them  but I can say  unofficially  that I ve NEVER yet  lost   hint   hint   So speed lovers out there  this is definitely one of the more rewarding cars to buy on the market  
Pos,  The Paparazzi  They re ALWAYS causin  problems b Much press has been given to the newly styled  1999 Mustang GT  and  Mustang SVT Cobra   both good and bad  We were originally attracted to the Mustang GT for its power and speed  but had never considered purchasing one until the 99 model year   the new styling  with it s crisper lines and more powerful engine were all we needed to fall in love with not just ONE but TWO Ponycars  As the proud owners of both a 99 GT and 99 Cobra we tend to disagree with much of the negative attention surrounding the Cobra and the rumored   performance inadequacies i b Let s clear up a few misconceptions b For starters  these problems did NOT plague all 1999 SVT s  Ford elected to perform these  Horsepower Upgrades  on a voluntary basis  as a response to SOME dissatisfied SVT owners  Fortunately  some Cobras managed to come off the lot in prime condition   and with the upgrades to the fuel chip  intake and exhaust system  WOW  While my GT boasts a respectable 260hp  and even though it s equipped with an automatic transmission  can easily hit the 60 mark in the advertised time  it pales in comparison to the gut wrenching power and sheer G force put out by the Cobra  Even prior to the upgrade  the Cobra was on par with both the Corvette and Camaro SS  although the advertised 0 60 times on these are slightly lower than that of the Cobra  Our Cobra was even fortunate enough to leave in it s wake a highly supercharged Supra equipped with Nitrous b Clutch in  let up on the Or was it b Driving the Cobra requires a complete re education in shifting and cornering  Most day to day driving will find you in 3rd or 4th gear  reserving 5th for only the highest of freeway speeds  You will immediately feel its power as you squeal off the line in first gear  But even more impressive is the monstrous pull of  SECOND  gear  and this is where you will gain your greatest acceleration  Third is nearly as powerful  and quite often you may find that you  bark  the tires when speedshifting from 2nd to 3rd  Drivers may at first be startled by the subtle lift of the front end of the car when accelerating suddenly b How ya like my  curves i b The handling and suspension are sheer perfection  The independent rear suspension allows you to take ramps  hills and curves at full speed with no lean or instability   no turn is too sharp for this snake  Shifting is crisp and quick  and with each successive gear  you ll feel all 320 of those horses just bucking to be set free  We had been advised that it would be possible to lower the suspension up to 3 inches  but have found this will not be necessary   the slightly higher stance gives the driver an excellent command of the road without sacrificing handling capabilities in the least b Fits you like a glove b The front seats are form fitting and highly supportive  even on long roadtrips  and front seat passengers can enjoy oodles of legroom  Backseats are comfortable  however rear legroom is limited  But let s face it   this is a sports car  not a minivan  The Mach 460 Soundsystem produces excellent  clear sound  though you may want to crank it in order to hear it over the roar of the V 8  The Cobra and the GT are pure driving enjoyment  both in daily traffic and on weekend excursions  The slightly crowded backseat and limited trunkspace are hardly worth mentioning when compared to the overall perfection of these performance machines b Author s note  Beware of Lot Lizards b One thing to keep in mind when purchasing a Cobra is that due to the limited release  only 3 500 per model year will be produced  some dealerships will try to impose a surcharge of over  6 000  DON T PAY IT  When the first dealership tried to sell us this car at close to  35 000  we walked  They attempted to convince us that it was FORD  not the dealership  that was imposing this fee   they called it a  Limited Release Surcharge  Upon investigation  we found that another local dealer also had one Cobra on it s lot  and they were in fact NOT overcharging  So stand your ground and don t let them fool you  A fully equipped Cobra hardtop should run you in the neighborhood of  28 29 000 b The final word b Last but not least  there is one positive result of all of the negative press surrounding the performance   you will find that other drivers  particularly those in other sports cars  may underestimate the power of your car  Just be sure to wave and smile as you leave them behind b Author s Addendum  September 28  2000  Our Cobra is a 1999  and despite what some people think  there  were  no 2000 Cobras  This has made the 1999 s even more sought after  at least down here in Florida  where it seems there are more Mustangs per capita than anywhere else in the U S  Some dealers still have a few left on the lot  and I ve seen price gouging even worse than 16 months ago when we purchased ours  But if you can get your hands on one  I d highly recommend it br br  
Pos, Prior to my new mustang  I had bought the 1994 model which was a new body design as with my current purchase  Both times I was extremely pleased with my purchase  Its always nice to get looks and compliments from strangers  especially when its a new body design  it just grabs attention  I bought the 1999 Mustang V6  there is no major changes to the year 2000 model  But compared to the previous years  model  the POWER is finally a long awaited  welcome to the new body desing  It was getting embarassing driving beside the VW Golfs  Jetta  Passats in their V6 engines  Not to mention the Hondas  Acuras  or the GM s and their peppy engines  For an American  quot muscle car quot  how could you have only put 135 HP on the V6 engine   But now  with 190 HP on the V6  you get the respect that was long overdue  But don t use the regular unleaded gas  you get nothing like the power it should have when you use the premium  Base models are packed with features that most people want  Power driver seat  Air Cond and Power Windows  ABS is an option  but I would strongly recommend it for this car  It sucks in the rain  and not that much better in the snow  But still  one of my favorites cause it is still rear wheel drive  Dual cup holders that actually hold the larger fast food cup sizes now  Well  large lit displays with easy to reach controls  I bought the model with the Mach460 sound system which is supposedly made by JBL it is sweet sounding and has a pretty hard punch to its bass  Ride is quiet  smooth for a sports car  and the engine exhaust sounds throaty unlike previous years when it sound winey and wimpy  Still  it can be improved to give the growl  even if it is only a V6  15 quot  Tires are too narrow  have to upgrade to at least 16 quot  Gas milage is a concern  it has gone down from my 1994  I spend about  15 for 80 Miles and that usually lasts me about 2 days only   As with my 1994  I ve had to do nothing but oil changes so far  For the price  it is still one of the best buys on the market  There are so many toys as well for this model  body kits  computer chips to boost HP  exhaust kits  etc  I bought the 1999 25th Anniversary edition and Ford showed some class by sending me a 25th anniversary kit that included a book of the Mustang s history  stickers and some other tidbits A few negative things I noticed so far is that in my automatic transmission  after coming to a stop  the transmission shifts back to 1st and you can feel a push jolt  So make sure you have your foot on the brake tight when you are at stop lights  Also  driver s seat belt locks up sometimes and straps you in to tight  The trunk height is useless  can t even fit a large suitcase in their  May be deep but height is a real problem  Why can t the make the trunk deeper like in European or Japanese models  br br  
Pos, Well lets see  The Ford Mustang  It goes way back in history as a muscle car of the 60 s and 70 s but still goes on today  I have never had the thrill of owning a Ford Mustang and probably never will  But my feelings will never change Back in the early 60 s there were many types of mustangs  coupe  convertable  fastback  GT  Boss  Ex  Now in the 90 s and in Y2K  There isnt as many versions of the mustang  You have the Cobra  Coupe  Conv  and Boss  You have to special order the real sportsters  They only market on the showroom floor the Convertable and Coupe  Why not let us see them all for a change  The major thing I like about the new mustang the 99 model and 2000 is that they have increased the horsepower up to 30hp  dont sound like much but you get into a v6 and it feels like you are in a Gt  No lie  I once testdrove a Gt and a v6  The power of a v6 was unreal and I really got excited as they put the extra umph  I really like the older style  but with the way the world goes everything must change  some for the better and some for the worst  I would surely buy a mustang if I was able to and really needed a sport car  but for the hot rod at heart its the sure choice br br  
Pos, My first car was a 1967 Mustang  289 cu in automatic with turn signals on the hood and a black vinyl roof over yellow paint job  Today this car would be the ultimate classic ride  Now in the nineties  I have owned three new Mustang s  95  97  99  and I believe that Ford is on the right track to making me as happy as the first one  The body style of the 1999 s is quite a bit different from the other two  With a rounder body and square like head  amp  tail lights this is more like a Toyota body style If I had a dollar for every person that told me   quot I love your car quot  or  quot cool car  man quot  it probably would be enough to make one of the payments  All three of these vehicles were five speed transmission s because I just love to drive  Living out in the hill country of Texas  not far from IH 10 it is easy to get down the road and make it to one of the big cities  Never had a bit of trouble with any of these vehicles and I easily put 4 to 5 thousand miles a year on the first two  With the MachI CD stereo system the road becomes a joy to own  The 95 was not a GT and the difference is quite noticeable during acceleration  I would recommend the 4 liter over the 3 liter engine if you do a lot of highway driving  One thing you may have to get used to is other  quot sporty quot  cars pulling alongside and begging you to have a race  This takes a little getting used to especially when most of the time it would be no problem to blow their doors off  Take a walk on the wild side with a new Ford Mustang Ford also sent me a fantastic gift package containing a three cd set of music from the 60 s  70 s  amp  80 s and a wonderful black leather mustang cd case as well as a hard cover edition of the  quot History of Mustang quot  Try and beat this deal br br  
Pos, This card provides a strong handling of the road and can work for the driver but if regular maintenance isn t maintained on this automobile it falls apart  This car takes constant care and is an asset to the buyer based on the look but can easily become a pocket drain  When you first get this car Ford generally sends a package that is very impressive  books and or memorabilia but remember this costs money and the company gets it from the price of the car  So decide if you want to pay for the looks and repairs  I have enjoyed the car but not the maintenance     
Pos, I recently purchased a new Ford Mustang and have nothing but good things to say about it  I had spent a lot of time looking at cars and doing research into what car I wanted  I had owned a Camaro before  and said I never wanted to have a Ford  Well  as I drove by the Ford dealership  the Mustang just jumped out at me  Something about that car really caught my attention  and why shouldn t it have  There are many perks to this car  First off  the Mustang is a legacy anyway  This car has a lot of history  Also  I really like what they have done with this new body style  As soon as I got in the car to test drive it  I knew it was the car for me  It has great power  good handling  good stereo system  and I like the inside a lot better than the Camaro  Not to mention  the price tag on it was very pleasing  too  After all the nonsense at the dealership  I ended up driving off the lot at around 18 000  Gotta give two thumbs up to Ford on this beauty br br  
Pos, In my opinion one of the better cars of 1999 would be the Ford Mustang  The new model Mustang contains a numerous amount of good characteristics  which  in my opinion  outweigh the seldom found negative qualities  The 1999 Mustang was given a change in body style from the previous year  which most people find very appealing  This car is ideal for any sports car lover on a tight budget  The new engine placed in the 1999 model gets 40 more horsepower than the previous year  which gives the V6 model Mustang a greater 0 60 than either of its leading competitors  the Pontiac Firebird or the Chevrolet Camaro  The Mustang even comes with more than average room in the front seats for sports cars  I myself am 6 2 quot  and in no way am I lacking in room  On the down side  like most sports cars who even have four seats  one would have to be around the age of ten to actually be comfortable in the rear seats of the car  The only negative comment that comes to my mind in my reflection of the year I have owned my Mustang is the relative easiness to lose traction on even semi wet roads  However  the optional traction control system for around  200 works great by quickly restoring traction to the vehicle after it begins to slip  The traction control system even comes equipped with an on off switch for those moments where a driver really wants to peel out at a stoplight  and show everyone around him that the Mustang is truly a great car br br  
Pos, The new Ford Mustang GT convertible is a very good car overall  It has great looks  great handling and an aggressive powerful feel  I personally give the car a 8 out of a 10  There are a few things I don t like though  they are   There is a lot of road noise and wind noise with the convertible  although the Horse power has been increased I still feel that the 5 0 motor is a better motor  Auto transmission in the 1999 2000 feels kind of sluggish  it feels like it takes too long for it to accept the power from the engine to drive the wheels  I kick myself for getting an automatic every day  if your going to get one go with the 5 speed it feels much more powerful  Also the back seat is mostly useless to any adult  Only kids or small adults can be comfortable in the back  Don t get me wrong I love the car and if I had to do it again I would buy the car again but this time i would get the 5 speed br br  
Pos, The new refined Mustang  quot GT quot  has its ups and downs  This car is very sleek and stylish with its redesigned interior and exterior  This car comes with a 4 6 liter V 8 that hd torque and agility of an American Sports car  The old 5 0 engine is missed because of its horespower and awsome sound but this new engine is doing real good for its smaller size  I like this car so much because its good looking and it drives like no other  I think it corners the best out of anything ive drivin  i also liked the manual transmission feel  i feel in control of the car at high speeds and low  The cost of this car is fairly reasonable for a car like this but kinda hard on the checkbook  The back seat is one of the downs because its too small for an adult to ride in its built for a smaller kid     
Pos, The 1999 2000 Mustang has got to be the most affordable sports car in it class  Averaging between  18 000 and  22 000 for the basic  5 speed  fully equipped model will outbeat any of it competition  Just the sound of the engine in the 5 speed when putting your foot on the gas will take your breath away I am only 26 years old  basically just getting my feet off the ground and always wanted my first new car to be a sports  and the Ford Mustang my that wish come true with it price and incentive programs  At any age  if you enjoy going fast and feeling power behind the wheel of your automobile when you put your foot on the gas  this car is for you Only downfall to this car  as well as all sports cars  is the lack of ability to drive it in the rain and snow without fear of losing control because of the rear wheel drive and lack of weight in the trunk area br br  
Pos, For 99 Ford made many improvements to the Mustang GT  More ponies  more leg room and a body redesign  The 99 Mustang GT does what the Mustang has always done  A good sports car at a good price  This doesn t handle like a Corvette but it s less then half the price  For the price this is probably the best deal for your money I ve had this up to top speed  147 MPH on the speedo  It ran as smooth as can be  If any law enforcement personnel are reading this I did this test on the track as far as you know The car handles very good in the corners  The back end is a little light though  The back end wants to swing out when you turn fast and hard  but what I m talking about here is VERY extreme cornering  Normal sports car corners are no problem  One problem  this car is like a cat  it hates water  Drive on wet pavement carefully or the you ll be spinning like a disco ball br br  
Pos, I have an electric green 1999 ford mustang and I love it  It is my first car and it is a great first car  At first  not being comfortable with driving got me worried about having a sports car  but it handles great and rides as smooth as anything  I love everything about it especially the color  because it is different  It handles great  gets great gas milage  easy to drive  I would reccomend it to anyone that wants a reliable  fun and easy driving vehicle  The only fault that I can say about this car is that it is not a family car  it is good for one or two people  but if you have kids  it is probabaly not the best choice  but besides that I love it  and it is very comfortable in the front br br  
Pos, I bought my 1992 Escort GT over three years ago  It had a little under 60 000 miles on it  which was less than it should have I bought it because it fit my budget  but was still sporty  After living with this car  I can recommend it to other buyers The body  interior  engine  and transmission of my car are all in excellent condition  for their age  The only major mechanical problem I had was when the timing belt snapped  but that should have been replaced at 65 000 miles  which it wasn t As far as driving  it is a very pleasant vehicle  relatively quiet  very secure and stable  I have a manual transmission  and the engine revs through the power band eagerly  Redline is at 7000  which allows a quick launch  and an impressive sprint to 60  Torque steer can be felt  particularly during hard acceleration or turning  but it isn t unreasonable  The available power is plentiful  and the car  coupled with a manual  really does return a satisfying driving experience The interior ergonomics are good  with the placement of the air conditioning and stereo within arm s reach  Each door features storage compartments  as well as the large glove box  Since this is a coupe  entry to the back seat can be difficult for adults The hatchback allows an ample amount of space for groceries  luggage  even large items  With the seats folded down  I ve been able to transport 27 quot  televisions  as well as an assortment of other things  all at the same time Two sore spots for my particular car have been the brakes  and an odd electrical problem that causes the car to stall  I ve replaced three out of four brake calipers  and have had no success in tracking down the electrical problem  Another thing a potential buyer should be aware of  the GT model of this car has the underpinnings of a Mazda Protege  Furthermore  replacement parts for this car commonly come from a Mazda dealership  or an independent foreign auto parts supplier  The powerplant is all Mazda electronics  including the starter  another replacement I have made  Overall  I didn t expect the phenomenal reliability my particular car has afforded me  Besides the infrequent electrical problem  the car has rarely had any mechanical problems  As with all used cars  do a thorough inspection of all fascets of the automobile before purchasing it  and I suspect you will find a reliable  cheap  economical  yet fun automobile br br  
Pos, I have owned a 1985 Ford T Bird  1992 Mercury Cougar and now a 1997 Ford T Bird  These are all essentially the same cars  given differences for model years  These cars are virtually indestructible for American manufactured autos  The  85 went 128K miles  the  92 was at 113K miles when they were sold and the  97 is at 45k miles  I had no major breakdowns on any of these and I was always impressed that when they were emissions tested  required in most states  even at high mileage  each tested well within the clean air standards  This indicates a well built  close tolerance engine  designed to last  Alas they are not made anymore  Ford realized they could make and sell a Ford Taurus Mercury Sable  a smaller car and less costly to produce and sell it for more profit than they ever saw on the T Birds or Cougars  Or you are forced to buy an even pricier Ford Crown Victoria or Mercury Grand Marquis if you like larger and safer auto  These were spiffy road cruisers with good looks  good gas mileage  and performed well for their size  If you can find a low mileage  97  they make a great second or even your main vehicle  These will no doubt be collector items for your children  
Pos, We chose this truck because it was an upgrade of our previous Ranger  You can tell we are  quot Ford people quot  We wanted a dependable truck which would out live the loan payments  Seven years and 100 000 miles later  it looks and drives as good as any of the newer models on the busy city streets and long Texas highways  The body shows no signs of deterioration and the engine still purrs little a kitten  It was bought without the automatic windows and doors for longevity  This was the correct choice since many of the automatic windows and doors fail long before seven years  We have had no major defects other than an oil pan leak caused by a bad gasket which proved to be costly since it required the removal of the transmission to get to the gasket to be replaced  Another short coming was the windshield wipers which were under designed  too small  for the truck which leaves areas of the windows which are not cleaned properly We intend to keep this truck for another three to four years or 200 000 miles which it will have no problem reaching  Then we will most likely choose another F150 or upgrade to one of those three door cabs  This vehicle is not for everyone  People who are under 5 feet tall  over 75 years of age should not buy this truck unless they have a step stool  If you are looking for a truck that is dependable  low maintenance and fits in your budget  try it you will like it     
Pos, If you ask most people about a Ford Taurus  their either going to tell you that they loved it or hated it  You re going to get a mixed response from me  If you are looking for a short term or lease vehicle  then this car is for you  If you are looking for a good  reliable long term car  4 years or more  then this is not the car for you  My in laws bought this car brand new at the end of a model year   They bought it having only 50 miles on it in January 1995  My husband acquired the car from his parents in January 1997  We had the car until we traded it in December 1999  Overall  it was a good car  There were some major repairs that had to be done   For example  a new head gasket costing around 2K  However  on most of the major repairs Ford did eventually recall the vehicle for that particular item  By recall  I mean that they refunded your money if you had already done the repair or repaired it for free if you hadn t  I d say that Ford recalled this car for about 6 different problems  The good point  is that they DID recall it when they found a consistent problem The problem for us came in December 1999 when the car had 93K miles  All at once  everything went wrong with the car  It needed a new air conditioner  new motor mounts  and new heat core among other things  The total for the repairs came to over  3 000  Needless to say  we were not going to put this kind of work into an old car  That s when we decided to trade it in  My in laws  amp  my family still buy the Ford Taurus  They have found the same thing that we have time  amp  again  The car is great for the 1st 3 4 years  Until we had these problems  the car was a very good  reliable car  The seats are very comfortable even on long road trips  We should know  we took many  many trips in that car  We will buy a Ford still   We have one now  We have learned from experience  though  When we re looking for a nice sized but affordable short term car  we will get a Taurus  If we re looking for a long term car that will be with us 10 years from now  we ll shop in another direction     
Pos, I was riding with my father in his Ford Taurus station wagon today to get some matierals for the construction workers that are remodeling our home  While in the car I thought it might be interesting to compare his car to my BMW 7 series  A review of my car can be read at  a href auto review 1E9A D8AFEF3 39277AA5 prod3 http www epinions com auto review 1E9A D8AFEF3 39277AA5 prod3 a  Some interesting facts I noticed was that the Taurus actually seems to accelerate smoother  and brake smoother than the BMW  although the BMW does accelerate faster  The seat comfort up front is comfortable in both cars  however I personally like the back seat more in the BMW  since it has head rests  and the seats are contoured for the body  For people with families that travel often and need room for luggage  such as my family  I would recommend the Taurus  For those who like to have luxuries  even to the point of having a weather station built into a car  I would recommend the BMW  The Taurus is also a smooth car  as is the BMW  The Ford is cheaper to get fixed  although it seems that it often does need fixing  usually nothing major  A recent fix was the air conditioning  which cost over  500 to fix  One feature that seems to be taken for granted in a lot of cars is the cup holder  The BMW does not even have one  although the Ford does  In the BMW I use the area on the door to place the cups  although it seems it was made for cassettes or CD s to be placed there  Another advantage of the Ford is that it is very good on gas  It gets probably about 8 mpg more than the BMW  when the BMW was purchased a gas guzzler tax needed to be paid  I like the Ford Taurus station wagon and would recommend it for families br br  
Pos, Ever went to purchase a vehicle and you wanted a family car and your spouse wanted a truck  Well Ford has done it  It is the Explorer Sport Trac  It is a combination of both  There is enough room inside for a family but then has a bed like a truck  Once we test drove this we knew that we had to have it  So that s what happened  we got us one  This has been one of the best vehicles that we have ever purchased  Besides being a combination car and truck it has many more unique qualities  Have you ever had to move and were worried about scratching or denting the bed of your truck  Well your worries are over  This truck has a guaranteed bed  It will never ding  dent or rust  Trust me it sounds like a gimmick  but I have tested it and know that it is all the truth  We recently helped family move and my husband had a tow bar in the bed  This thing was sliding all around  Every time that we slammed on the brakes it would hit the back of the bed and I thought there is no way that this bed is going to make it through this  Well  it did it  There was not one scratch ding or dent in the entire bed  Also  there is an extra electrical outlet in the bed of the truck  This is great for trailers  power tools and camping  It came with a hard top cover  The Explorer Sport Trac came equipped with a V 6  But it feels like it is a V 8  It is fully loaded  Electrical mirrors  windows  locks and driver seats  There are leather seats There is an overhead counsel that indicates direction and the temperature  It will also let you know of sever conditions outside  Such as icy roads or extreme heat  There is also a rear control panel for the back seat passengers  It lets you control the heat  fan  and radio from the back seat  I think that this vehicle is perfect for everyone  Weather you are looking for a family car or a sporty little truck  you have found the perfect one     
Pos, To start off  I d like to state that I m the proud owner of a brand new Sport Trac  I spent a long time researching the available cars  and this turned out to be the right one for me  I found that almost all my initial concerns were incorrect  and a couple innovative features took me by surprise b EXTERIOR  9 5  This is one of the biggest head turners I ve ever seen  And it isn t just the strange hybrid that causes it  This car has character  It has the aggressive front end style that Ford is putting on the 2002 Explorer  It s got a sturdy  rugged roof rack  It has exterior tie down hooks running the length of the bed  Even the tailgate is different from anything else  with the Ford logo embossed proudly in the center  Prepare for plenty of questions from onlookers in parking lots and at intersections   b INTERIOR  10  The interior is the part I love  When people get in this car  they expect a simple  trucklike look  While the Sport Trac has rubber floors and water resistant seats  it s no truck  A great CD stereo system  white faced speedometer  comfortable bucket seats  power rear window  and more leg room than a regular Explorer  If the stereo is on too loud when you turn it off  it automatically sets it to a reasonable volume when you start the car up again  Keyless entry  remote entry  illuminated entry  the list goes on  The plastic texture on the dash isn t great  but other than that it s a beauty  Since there s no huge empty cargo area in the back  the air conditioner and stereo work very well  The only feature I don t like on my Sport Trac is the rear floor console  It allows people in the back to choose what music to listen to  The problem is that there s no way for the driver to override it b ENGINE  7  The Sport Trac engine can tow up to 5000 lbs  However  it suffers from very poor acceleration  If you want this car to move  you have to hit the pedal to the floor  This will come as a shock even to those who frequently drive other SUVs b RIDE  9  Very quiet  comfortable ride  The engine is almost silent  and road noise is kept to an absolute minimum at most speeds  Ford did a great job in stiffening the Explorer frame  It makes the ride very enjoyable  and a far cry from other trucks you might encounter b HANDLING  10  Incredible handling  Very tight turning  with wheels planted at all speeds I tested  Emergency maneuvers are able to be completed with no problem  For instance  an idiot car pulled out of a parking lot right in front me  and I was able to swerve and avoid it easily   RELIABILITY  N A  Ford claims that no maintenance will be required  but I m not absolutely sure  Unfortunately  the car is too new for me to give an accurate review  However  I will say that Ford has done a good job by marking the engine spots you would most likely need to access with bright yellow paint  They also have a roadside assistance warranty for any unexpected problems you might encounter b VALUE  8  Very cool car in almost every respect  Unfortunately  it is also very pricey  My model ran  27000 and I didn t bother with leather  6cd changer  tonneau cover  or many of the other available features  However  I am very pleased with it so far and would definitely recommend it b Initial concerns b  Not enough space for groceries or other common items  Poor acceleration  Simple interior  Cramped seats  Huge size  Bad ride b New realizations b  Plenty of room when seats are down  Poor acceleration    Wonderful gadget filled interior  Comfortable seats  A little bit long  but not too wide  Carlike ride b CONCLUSION  If you don t need to use an enclosed cargo area every day and occasionally carry something dirty or wet  this is definitely the car for you  It s great for scuba diving  and I m sure many other sports would benefit from it as well  The back is sturdy but light  the cabin is rugged but elegant  this is truly a hybrid br br  
Pos, I always thought of a vehicle in utilitarian terms  A car is a car  if it got me from point A to point B safely and without incident  it did it s job  My Chevy conversion van did this without any trouble for the 8 years I owned it  So why is it that this vehicle has changed my mind  I chose this vehicle mainly because it was different from the other cars on the road  At first glance  I thought it was weird looking  Then I looked again and thought  I can see me in one of those  SUV s are so overdone now  I don t want a truck   they ride like a truck  I can t go back to a car  they are so short  A station wagon  no way  And I was just so tired of the big van Yes the SportTrac fits the bill perfectly  Not a  mom  car at all  Enough room for all 5 if need be   but with a 17  15 and 11 year old  not a common occurance these days  The interior is comfy  the ride is smooth and quiet  With the tonneau cover it is just like a car  trunk  yet I can fold out the cage and use it for hauling  tho  nothing  dirty  those things are for my husbands truck  With the cage in regular position  I have a place to put my groceries  and they don t slide around in the bed   I was EVER so tired of groceries falling out the door of my van  and mini van before that The v 6 engine has the  pulling out  power that I need   Like a shot  I find it extremely easy  and fun to drive  and imagine my surprise at turning up a snowy hill  beginning a fishtail  turning that little switch  and sailing up the hill around the other vehicles   I ve never before appreciated the value of 4 wheel drive  this is my first  In the past I washed my van perhaps once a year  this one I wash once a week  sometimes more often  Can you see where I m going with this The leather interior warms up quick  the heat is top notch  The dealer replaced the Firestone tires for free  I think because they screwed up my order and I had to wait 5 months for my SportTrac  I got it in December  2000  It has gone through a snowy and messy northeast winter with no complaints so far  I am no longer nervous about driving in the snow  tho  I still don t trust other drivers  I don t hear the whistle that I have heard others complain about I find that I park in places that maximize the visibility of my SportTrac   is that so wrong  It certainly turns heads  I let my husband take it to work once so he could show it off to his co workers  they were all very impressed  or so I m told  I enjoy picking up my daughter at school  but I am careful to look non chalant about driving this cool vehicle  Perhaps in a year or two  I ll let my son borrow it  he keeps bugging me to let him  There is a drawback tho  I have to call it a vehicle  it s not a truck you know  Also  I got the best color  the island blue  which is really teal  You must have mud flaps in the snow  or you get snow sludge on the rails  They are not included  or an option when I got mine  I got all the options except the moon roof   it makes the interior roof lower  and I am tall  and the 6 CD player  I have CD s at home  but I enjoy the radio  and I have 12 programmed stations to choose from  There is a single CD player and cassette player in it   Do people still use cassettes While I realize that this is a new vehicle and it should be just as I wanted   after all I chose it  I have never had such an interest in a car  um  I mean vehicle  I hope that my joy in this vehicle is long lived  and only time will tell  but for now as you can see  I cannot say enough about my SportTrac  And while I highly recommend it  don t buy one  or mine won t be so unique any more  
Pos, The first time I saw a Ford Explorer Sport Trac  I knew I had to have one  Then I found out what they cost  But I waited a while and finally got one that was reasonably affordable and well equipped  Let me state right off that this is not a technical review  I am just going to tell you what I like and don t like about the vehicle First of all  if you want a vehicle that gets attention  this is the one  The Sport Trac is still rare enough that a large number of people do a double take when they see it and many will come up to you to get a closer look The thing that first attracted me to the Sport Trac was that I wanted a four door vehicle  but I also wanted a truck  I really did not like the looks of the four door pickups  The Sport Trac is a good compromise  We have found the interior to be quite roomy and have carried five people quite comfortably in the vehicle  However  I would state that I would not want to take a long trip with three adults in the back seat  The front seats are fairly comfortable  but the seats could do better in terms of lumbar support  The air conditioner works quite well and there is a vent in the center console for the back seat passengers  I tend to keep this shut off  however  as it is a little noisy  The 4 speaker am fm cd cassette player is a good one  I would rate the sound excellent  as well as the radio reception  The floor of the vehicle is rubber  but Berber carpet mats come with it  I like this feature  The rear window is a power window with three positions  closed  open  and vent  In the latter position  it is open about one inch  Instrumentation in the Sport Trac is attractive  I enjoy the thermometer in the center overhead console  Even though it looks as if the vehicle is equipped with gauges  this is a little deceiving  The oil pressure gauge is a disguised  idiot light  with only two positions The rear seats fold down to give additional cargo space  Unbeknownest to many  the rear seats lock in place  making for a more secure floor for packages  etc  Behind the seats is a minimal amount of cargo space for a few tools  a jack  and the like The Sport Trac is adequately powered  and my experience is that it handles quite well  One day a  less than attentive  driver pulled out in front of me  and I braced myself for the sound of metal against metal  However  I was able to negotiate the Sport Trac to avoid the other driver  So I rate it high on maneuverability  In terms of gas mileage  I get 16 18mpg around town  Although I have not been on a long trip yet  I believe I will get in the 20 21mpg range The ride is a good one  I would rate it quite comfortable  There is a little wind noise at higher speeds  The cargo bed is smaller than a regular pickup  but I have found it to be quite adequate  A fold out cargo cage is an option  This is a good way to extend the bed to about 6 feet  but I placed a hard cover on my bed and removed the cage  However  I installs and removes with a minimum of effort  There are numerous tie downs in the cargo bed  which makes it easy to secure a load  I have only had my Sport Trac for about 3 1 2 months  but I have had not trouble with it  All in all  I am pleased with my purchase and would definitely do it again  
Pos, Ford has done its homework on the new 2001 Sport Trac  The Sport trac has the most front and rear seat room of any vehicle in it s class  Granted the other companies have done a great job  the Sport Trac is a step ahead of the rest  Negative coments about rear set leg room being cramped  this is far from the truth  Not only is there plenty of room for kids  an adult of 5 foot 11 inch has plenty of room for comfort  The bed is slightly shorter than other competitors but all you need to do is drop the tail gate and flip up the bed extender  With the optional extender  your bed is now a full 6 foot  With the ample 4 liter v6 you have plenty of power to pull your camper or boat  The standerd features here are options on other trucks  The rear power window is a great feature not seen anywhere else  Granted you are slightly limited on storage space behind the rear seat  just add your optional tonneau cover and you are ready for that trip to the beach  Ford you have done a great job on the new Sport Trac  It was so impressive  I bought the first one to arrive at Bob Dunn Ford br br  
Pos, I bought my sport trac in 2001 and have used it hard for two full years and this is what I think so far The best thing is that I m 6 2  tall and I fit in it comfortably  If that wasn t good enough  my brother is 6 5  and he has sat behind the driver seat and not griped  I can t find anyone who can top that The bed is short  but I like that  I tend no to haul a million tons of raw steel at any given time  but I do throw lots of camping equipment in the bed  or bicycles  or my mud covered dog and it works great  I purchased an aftermarket tonnau cover for the bed  the dealer one was too pricey  and I love it  The bed is extra deep and I rarely need to take the cover off of it The fact that I can fit five full grown adults and all their gear for a week long trip all into one vehicle is great  I have driven the truck through a dry  and not so dry  rocky creek bed to go caving deep in the woods of West Virginia and it has amazing ground clearance  This comes at a price though  my short wife has a little trouble getting in and out I got the rear wheel drive version only  and through a couple winters in Pennsylvania snow and ice  I wish I had gotten the 4 wheel drive instead  but at the time  the cost was too high for me The look is wonderful because I can take it out on the town and not feel like I m driving a pickup  but I can also take it home depot and not feel like the idiots putting plywood on the roof of their cavaliers  It s not overly tall like a land rover or a hummer  it s not overly long  so I can park in normal spaces in normal parking garages Finally  the back power window that goes up and down is great for extra long lumber and for the dog to stick it s head out the back  Now for negatives I should have gotten 4 wheel drive because of the outdoor activities I do in it and due to the snow and ice The turning radius is not so good The gas consumption is around 18 20 mpg  not bad for a truck  but not good for an suv When empty  just me driving it  it s a little bouncy  Since it is designed to haul loads  without them  the springs are a bit much  so sometimes control is an issue for the same reason  
Pos, I took a Ford Sport Trac for a test drive I really like the practicality of the design I am considering the Leather group option as well as the sun roof option The only consideration with the sun roof is the loss of head room I think the price is moderate but I m sure there is room for negotiation To like this vehicle is a personal taste but I think it is very innovative and well thought out Reliability may be another issue but if it is anything like the regular explorer it should be fine I would expect this vehicle to sell well because it serves two purposes The truck buyer and the SUV buyer could both enjoy it To me it is the best of both worlds It may be tricky to get options though In the brochure there is more than one picture of bicycles with the forks of the bicycle attached to a bar that runs across the bed of the truck I have enquired at the dealership about this option and they are not sure about how much it is and when it would be available This option I would serious consider because one of the main purposes for me to purchase the truck would be to transport my bicycles br br  
Pos, This is my first  non car  vehicle I ve ever owned and I absolutely love it  It was difficult to pay as much for it as I did  but I am very happy with the purchase and would do it again in a heartbeat  It has just over 8000 miles and has never had any problems  The ride is smooth and quiet  I LOVE the lumbar support  My friends  whom drive trucks  are amazed at the ride comfort The bed may seem short  but it has never let me down  I ve moved my kitchen table  chairs  furniture  and 2 Queen mattresses in the bed  not at the same time  Using the Bed Extender and the handy tie down handles located at the top of the bed  it can carry a lot 4X4 handles great too  It s gotten me through heavy snows and I actually got to use it off road once  in the mud  with no problems  For more info  visit http www teamsporttrac com 
Pos, I ve had my 91 Ford Probe LX for 2 years  now  Overall  it is quite an excellent car  and will probably drive you to the end of the earth  It has the first generation Probe body style  which in my opinion looks better and much sportier than the second generation body  I bought mine with 145000 miles on it  and the major problem I had with it was the cooling system  I had to replace the radiator  heat sensing unit  themostat  and coolant tubes  This is very important to check out  because if one of those coolant tubes break  you re not going anywhere  Though this is important to check out on any used car  it s especially important on this model of Probe  After I had that fixed  I have had absolutely no problems with the Probe  It s a very reliable car  always starts in the winter  and has taken me on quite a few long interstate trips  I ve seen some of these things with 250000  miles on them  The LX is one of the few models to have a 3 0 V 6 engine  Stomp on the gas and it goes when it has to  These cars were originally built for rally races  which means on the automatic transmission  there is a manual downshifting button  If used correctly you can outrun a Mustang  but don t count on beating higher level models  The car drives quite comfortable and smoothly  although the suspensions pretty tight  so you can feel bumps in the road  It s pretty nimble too  and if you re good you can drive yourself out of a bad situation with ease  This thing has breaks from hell  it can stop on a dime  and work the brakes pretty hard too  Gas mileage is pretty decent for a V 6  and has all kinds of computer controlled engine efficiency systems  It has electric windows  and defogger which are quite nice  The front is roomy  the back however is for midgets  and the trunk is bigger than you would expect  Once you make sure everything is is running order  it ll last a long time br br  
Pos, Recently I took the family on a 10 day trip to CA   In fact  we just got back today after a red eye flight  Why am I writing a review instead of sleeping  Waiting on laundry so I have something to wear to work tomorrow     For the duration of the trip we rented a  2001 Ford Taurus SES  4 door sedan that had about 2 000 miles on it when we picked it up b The road test  During the 10 day trip we put over 1 000 miles on the car  I drove about 95  of those miles  We went from the congested highways of the San Francisco Bay Area  to the wide open spaces of I 5 and the Central Valley  to the Sierra Nevadas and the twisty roads of Yosemite National Park  with side trips up to Sacramento and Sebastopol  Road conditions were always dry b Appearance  comfort  spaciousness  The appearance of the Taurus has improved greatly since the oval mania years  Of course  this improvement now means the car is average looking rather than ugly  It may not turn any heads  but it also won t appear dated in a few years  The car displays clean lines  conservative styling with a slight racy flair  Sporty wheels  rather than wheel covers  are a nice touch The driver s seat is comfortable and suitable for drives of several hours  It was easy for me to find a good driving position  though I m pretty average  5  11  average weight more or less  My wife had no complaints about the passenger seat and I thought it was fine during my short stint there  Backseat legroom appeared average  We had the 2 car seats in the back and only once stuffed someone in the back between them my mother   Lest you think I have it in for my mother  she just really hates riding in the front seat  Her main complaint was the hump in the middle of the floor   Why is that there in a front wheel drive car anyway Interior storage space is adequate  I m used to a minivan for our family travels so maybe I m a little bit spoiled when it comes to cupholders and places to throw things  The dash does not have built in cupholders  instead they are built into the cushions in the center seating position  If there is no center passenger in the front seat  the armrest is folded up and the center seat cushion flips around to reveal 2 cupholders and a general storage area  Now revealed on the floor under the armrest are coin holders  cassette tape storage  even though we didn t have a cassette player in our car  and more general storage space  The cup holders will hold most normal sized cups but will probably not hold Big Gulps or larger  There are two cup holders for the back seat that are also modestly sized Trunk space met our needs with no room to spare  We stored 7 bags in the trunk  from my wife s behemoth suitcase to a carry on sized bag  We were so tight that when we took my mother for a 2 night trip  I could fit her garment bag in the trunk but her small  carry on sized  bag had to ride with the passengers I don t have specs  speaker count  wattage  for the stereo system  In our car we had AM FM CD  with separate controls for bass  treble  balance  and fade  We picked up a couple of CDs when we discovered we had a player in the car  we didn t bring any of our own not expecting this feature  and they sounded like  well  CDs  The player did its job  no skipping on bumpy roads  AM FM reception was good  The stereo sounded clear and we enjoyed listening to it  both of our cars have premium sound systems so we re a little spoiled there too  It was loud enough to drown out the kids if necessary  Climate control was very good  I didn t get to use the heater  but the air conditioner works very well and doesn t seem to tax the engine at all  The front defroster clears the windshield in short order  Fan noise is average b Miscellaneous  The key fob has buttons for door lock  unlock  trunk open  and panic  honk horn  flash lights  There were no integrated child seats  The rear windows only roll down halfway  and the doors have child switches  which prevent the door from being opened from the inside  Child seat tether anchors are easily reached as they are on the rear shelf  There was some other mount at the base of the rear seat but I don t know what that was for  Rear defogger works quickly  Windshield washer fluid is dispensed in copious amounts so the windshield gets clean fast b Ride  handling  performance  Empty or loaded  the car rides very nicely  Even though from the outside the car appeared at full capacity  with a full trunk and full back seat  there was no noticeable change in the ride  Acceleration could be a little better  it takes a good mash of the accelerator to kick the car into passing gear and get moving  Overall  though  the power is more than enough  we zipped up mountains with all our stuff  air conditioner on  Through the winding mountain roads the car performed nicely  It took a little while to get a feel for the car  normally I drive a Mitsubishi Eclipse  but when I did I was able to safely navigate the turns at a decent rate of speed  fast enough to make my wife tell me to slow down at least no one rode our tail  On the flat  droning asphalt of I 5 the car tracked steady  largely unaffected by the wind or trucks  Cruise control works as advertised  though I didn t test it on hills I did not track gas mileage but fuel consumption appears average  given my lead foot  From the East Bay to our destination in Yosemite  a trip of about 200 miles  the car used less than 3 4 of a tank of gas  This drive consists of solid freeway traffic  high speed interstate driving  and a 6000 foot climb into the mountains  The car takes regular unleaded All in all this is very nice car to drive  I don t think I d call it  fun  but it makes driving as painless as possible  
Pos, On a recent vacation  I got plenty of time to become acquainted with the 2001 Ford Taurus   7 days and 1200 miles worth  We drove from Las Vegas to LA  San Diego  and Laughlin The exterior of the car has a modern look is is a vast improvement from the last generation of Taurus that looked like an egg on wheels  Nothing too fancy and not bland  perfect mix for a family car The Taurus has a well laid out interior  All switches were easily within reach and gages were easy to read  The 6 way power driver seat was easy to operate and it did not take long to find a comfortable position  Overall  the interior is very generous with ample headroom and legroom The base V6 and automatic transmission setup was good but not great  I didn t have any problems climbing the mountains between California and Nevada and the transmission downshifted at the right times  If I were to purchase a Taurus for myself  I would opt for the 200HP engine The suspension provided a smooth  family car  ride  held corners well  and transmitted little road vibration to the cabin  The turning radius was a too little large  As a tourist  I found myself making frequent U turns  because I was lost quite a bit  and the car seemed to have a larger turning radius than similar cars in its class  I ended up making a few 3 point turnarounds instead of U turns due to the large turning radius I was not able to accurately measure the gas mileage as all the driving we did was highway driving  I averaged about 28 29 MPG over the trip One thing I did not like was the operation of the AC compressor with the climate control system  The AC compressor is engaged automatically at the different vent settings leaving no manual AC switch to engage or disengage  I prefer to have the AC switch separate because in mild weather I will turn the AC off to improve upon gas mileage My only other complaint was a minor build quality issue  When I opened the trunk  the lining material was pulled away from the sides and would not go back into place In closing  this was the first time I enjoyed driving a rental car  Ford offers a good package of options at a competitive price  Next time we are shopping for a family car  the Taurus will be on our list  
Pos, Let me say first  that our family already owns a 1996 Ford Taurus Wagon  We liked the wagon  and decided to look into another Ford this year  This year we decided again to go with a Ford  We purchased an SEL which is Ford s top of the line Taurus  We got the following options  Side air bags Dual electric seat adjustment  adjusts height and distance from dash Six CD device in trunk Traction control Leather seats  a Ford promo that was free We liked the SEL model because it has a stronger engine  Our 1996 wagon didn t have the best pick up  I love the way the car controls the interior temperature  You dial up the temperature via a thermostatic mechanism like your house  In the winter  when you want to heat the car  the car knows to blow the cold air though the vents by the windshield until the air heats up  Then it automatically shoots the air through whichever vents you ve chosen  I also like that that the outside temperature is displayed I like the center compartment between the driver and passenger  The cup holders have been improved and work better than on the 1996 wagon we have  It is nice also that in the back seat there is an arm rest in the middle  I have two children and now they know where their side of the seat ends I LOVE LOVE LOVE the keyless entry system  There is a control button to pop the trunk which is great during shopping sprees  Also  if you can t find the car in the parking lot  you can make the horn beep or pop the trunk to find it  There is a lot of trunk space and you can push the back seats down to get more space via the trunk  I like the  net  they provide which can hold groceries in the trunk without having them spill out of the bag The only minor problem with the car is that it doesn t have the best gas mileage  I can t remember exactly what we get gallon  but it will say on the sticker Be sure to do your homework  There are a lot of internet sites that list what the dealer s cost is  Know it before going in  We paid  200 over invoice  
Pos, Maybe if my purchase of the 1996 Ford Windstar LX passenger van had been as a new vehicle  instead of as a used vehicle with 35 000 hard miles on it  I would have enjoyed it more  Or maybe if I had never gone from driving passenger vans to SUVs before purchasing the Windstar I would have like it more  Or maybe   oh  who knows The bottom line is I really don t like this van  It had 35 000 miles on it when I traded in my beloved Honda Passport for it  I didn t want to give up my Passport  which might also have contributed to my dislike of the Windstar  but the Passport had a standard transmission and the clutch  combined with stop and go driving  became painfully incompatible with my very sick left knee  Financial circumstances  my knee  and the shortage of gently used SUVs available in the Spring of 1999 led me to purchase the 1996 Windstar b Selling Features  I ve already mentioned that finances were a concern when I purchased the Windstar  Priced about  2 000 below any reasonably used and available SUVs at the time  the Windstar seemed like a bargain  I test drove the Windstar  a Mercury Villager  and a Chrysler Town And Country before deciding on the Windstar  Comfort  price and interior space were the major deciding factors as were the reliability ratings for the Windstar when compared with the other passenger vans A passenger car was not an option for me   after years of driving passenger vans and SUVs  I feel small and target like in a car b My 1996 Windstar  With a 6 cylinder  200 Horsepower engine  the Windstar is powerful enough for rapid acceleration  That s a necessity around here  and for me in general  as a light foot is something I ve never been accused of having behind the wheel Comfort is great for middle and back seat passengers  with adequate legroom for adults  Front seats are less comfortable  with driver s seat adjustments being minimal  but not completely unacceptable  A four hour drive to the beach is manageable  but a longer trip would require frequent stops Reliability is less than expected based on the reports I had read  but not outrageous  I ve had numerous electrical problems with my Windstar  including a phantom door locking problem and flaky  quot door open quot  indicators  Fortunately  all problems have been minor and were not safety issues Handling is typical for a passenger van  with a slightly sluggish feel  Driving on curvy mountain roads  sort of my  quot acid test quot  for handling and responsiveness  is not enjoyable in the Windstar The driver s seat belt has an unfortunate habit of jamming  although no passengers have ever noted a similar problem with the other seat belts  The captains seats in the center have been a blessing  preventing major sibling battles  although the mid van controls for the heat  air  and radio  which are available on one side only  have caused more than their share of conflict All driver controls are easily accessible and gauges and displays are well placed  The heater is powerful enough  which I ve not always found to be the case in passenger vans  and the air conditioner does an amazingly good job of cooling the entire vehicle quickly  Drink holders are smaller than is often necessary  they won t hold a large take out drink  but there are plenty of them Gas consumption  averaging around 24 miles per gallon  is better than I expected  although it does drop significantly when primarily city driving is done b The Final Analysis  Now that I ve detailed the features of my 1996 Windstar and my assessment of them  I realize I don t dislike the van nearly as much as I thought I did  Well  I still don t like it  but now I see that it s more a factor of my personal preference than the quality of the Windstar I guess that makes me feel better  But I suppose now I ll have to stop referring to it as  quot that tank of a van I m driving quot  Maybe my kids are right about this one  maybe I just need to  quot get over it quot br br  
Pos, I bought my 1996 Windstar because it drove well and had plenty of room inside for my family  The next year it got five stars in the crash test ratings  When someone pulled out in front of me and I hit them going about 50 mph  the front end crumpled in the middle just like it is designed to  My two children  in the back seat  and I walked away with minor injuries  something I feel very strongly would not have happened in a smaller  or less well built car  Even though I am not a  quot mini van kind of person quot  this vehicle is great for a family  The sliding doors shut firmly  but are easy for elementary school age children to open  I am glad I got the air conditioning in the back of the van  I don t like that when you have the heater on  the air is still cool coming from the vents in the roof  I only get about 18 miles per gallon  I wish there was a console between the two front seats If I buy another mini van  it will be a Ford Windstar br br  
Pos, We own a 1996 Ford Windstar GL  This was our first car that we ever purchased through a dealer  We have had it almost a year now  and we haven t had any problems at all with this vehicle  We are a young couple with two children  This mini van is exactly what we need as far as the kids and stuff goes  but it is also sporty enough to not make us feel like we are too old  LOL We love the fact that it has the seperate air conditioning in the back  So many times I have rode in a van that you were roasting in the back and they were freezing up front  This way the kids or whoever can control their own temperature in the back  I also like the radio controls in the back for the kids  that way if they want to listen to something on a long trip they are able to use ear phones if they want  It is also nice that you can turn those controls off in case your kids are too little to understand that they aren t just play buttons    The radio is nice in these vehicles too  We took it on a long trip this last summer and the ride and the handling of the car was nice  we even went up into the mountains and it handled great  No problem getting around those curves or up the mountain  This mini van is defanitly a van that the young and old can both enjoy     
Pos, The Ford Windstar is a great minivan for those families out there that are always on the run  I love it  It actually drives like a car even though it is pretty large  It has a nice look and is comfortable  I have had this van for four years and it is still holding up  I recommend this to anyone who wants a minivan that drives great and is worth the price  I bought it for  25 000 and it is great  I have had no problems with this car and recommend it  Take it from me  the Ford Windstar is a great van and worth the price     
Pos, My husband of almost 2 years and I own a 1996 Ford Windstar  Between us  we have 5 kids so a mini van became a must when we got married  I had previously owned a Plymouth Voyager but when I met my husband  I had a small car  We bought the Windstar out of necessity but I have to admit that I love the comfortable ride  the opening hatch that conveniently holds groceries or  quot surprises quot  that I don t want the kids to see right away or whatever else I chose to store back there  My family fills that van when we all go somewhere together yet still  everyone sits comfortably  If there were one thing I would like to have had on this van  it would be the now popular extra sliding door  That would come in handy  especially  when I want to get kids in and out and would like to not fan the baby  Another drawback to this particular van is that we have had continuous problems with the check engine light coming on and for some reason  the drivers side window is now refusing to come down  We ve had it in the shop many times and they reset the computer and all is well until the next go around  Now  the warranty is out so we don t rush it in anymore  The check engine light is out but the window is still giving us trouble  This is extremely annoying but as far as comfort and the way it drives  I still love it br br  
Pos, Ford Winstars are the coolest minivans on the market  well i guess as cool as you can get for a minivan  All of a sudden all of the other minivans look alot like the windstars  way to go to set the trend  Fords minivan the windstar is about loaded with all the options that you can think about  The come well equipped with a great safety package  actually the best one out  They have pretty good power  and run rather well  My Mom has one and its got alot of miles on it now and it still runs nicely  the only bad thing is the transmission  our driveway is slanted upward and when you put it in reverse to go down the driveway it pops into gear instead of just going into it  That is my only complaint well that and they hub caps were so good that someone stole them from us but oh well  we can get more br br  
Pos, Well  my parents bought a red Windstar from a dealer that buys autos at auctions and such  and we got it about as brand new as a used car could be  it had about 1 6k on it  and had barely been considered used by the dealer  So we got it for about  4 000 off  and I think my parents got it for about 16 000 in 1996  There is plenty of legroom for everyone  and a space perfect for a cooler right next to the sliding door  which came in handy when we went down to see the Huskies in the 2001 Rose Bowl recently   Go Dawgs I recommend this vehicle to any family that wants a good versatile van that has some power  V6 is pretty impressive for a minivan and has room for all passengers  
Pos, My old tempo was on its last leg when our local Ford dealer was having a big sale  I looked around and picked out a 1995 Ford Escort LX  It was a year old when I got it  having a previous life as an Enterprise rental car  It had about 18 000 miles on it First of all I was surprised at how much pick up the car had  At first I thought that was just because my present car had virtually none  But it still has great pick up  even four years later  This is especially important when entering the highway from an entrance ramp I am able to accelerate quickly to enter at highway speed  It is always annoying when a car enters the highway at 35 mph The car gets very good gas mileage  At the time it was rated for about 35 mph highway 27 mph city  Depending on conditions  I find I can get even higher mileage than that  One particular trip I got about 45 miles to the gallon  Keep your car tuned up and you should be able to do as well  Using air conditioning lessons the mileage somewhat And speaking of air conditioning it works great  In fact  it gets cold and I have to turn the fan down to the first notch  Sometimes I even have to turn it off  I have never had a need to use the  quot MAX quot  air conditioning  Circulation of cold air in the back is a little more limited though  so if people in the front are cold  vents can be redirected to people in the back This car has an Overdrive gear  which improves the gas mileage even more  The car does have less power in this gear and it will automatically shift down if power is needed  such as going uphill  For short stretches it is okay to let the car shift automatically  For longer hauls  though  it better to downshift to drive  so as to not stress the transmission The interior is very roomy for a economy car  There is plenty of room in the front seat passengers  The seats are adjustable for taller drivers and riders  Headroom may be limited for people over about 6 ft 2 in  As long as the front seats aren t pushed back too much to accommodate taller riders  there is plenty of room for the average height adults in back  There is plenty of width for two back seat passengers  The four doors are more convenient for allowing entrance and exit of back seat passengers or for loading groceries and other stuff The trunk is quite roomy for such a small car  Room will be diminished however  when you replace the  quot donut quot  they call a spare tire with a real one  You can  however  still use that concealed space to store smaller items such as oil  jumper cables  etc  One neat feature is that the back seats fold down to connect to the trunk  In this way  longer items such as gardening timbers can be placed in the trunk without sticking out into traffic The car has what is called  quot passive restraints quot  This translates to automatic seat belts and air bags  The automatic seat belts are the type that drag along the frame of the window and lock in place as soon as the key is turned in the ignition  That secures the shoulder strap in place  The lap belt is separate  which is nice because you can then adjust it to fit your body  The air bags are contained in both driver and passenger side  Even with all the negative press on the potential danger of air bags  I am still glad they are there  Both these features give me a break on my car insurance  Another safety feature is that the rear windows will only roll down halfway  This helps ensure that children or pets do not fall out As part of the purchase price I bought an additional package for  250  This package entitles me to lube service at the Ford dealer for as long as I own the car  This service is provided at every 3 000 miles or every three months whichever comes first  I consider this a very good deal since a Fast Lube station will run about  30 a whack  I have more than got my money s worth out of this service Another thing I really like is the rack and pinion steering  While I can t technically tell you what that means  you will know if you don t have it  The steering is VERY tight  You move the wheel just a little bit and the car goes that way  This improves the car s maneuverability quite a lot  I find it easy to avoid idiotic drivers on the road as well as squeeze into a parallel parking space  A few weeks ago I had to fill in for our regular vanpool driver no rack and pinion on that van  The steering was so sloppy you could make almost a full half turn before the vehicle did anything  And every little bump jarred the wheels you had to keep a tight grip  Not so  on my nice little Escort About the only complaint I have is the warranty service  All three of the problems I had occurred within the first year  The first was a bent louvre in the dashboard  The whole dashboard was replaced since it is all one molded piece of plastic  For some reason that repair went smoothly and I did not have to pay a thing  But then I took it in because a clicking noise I heard while braking  It was about a  200 repair  I had to pay a  50  quot deductible quot  I understand this is a fairly common thing with car warranty s now  but even if it is I don t like it  After all  I have already paid a new car warranty of  800 when I bought the car  I don t feel I should have to pay anything else  Anyway  the problem was fixed The one serious repair I had to do was also  thank goodness  handled under warranty  Just had to pay the  50  but the repair was a  1 200 repair  The whole head had to be replaced  Something had come loose inside the engine and had worn a groove in the head  Though you might think this might be enough to turn me off the car it didn t  It made me pretty annoyed at the dealer  however  for keeping me waiting for three weeks  But actually  the car ran much better and seemed to have even more pick up and more power than before I still have the car and still love it  I should probably trade it in on something while I can get such low interest rates  But I can t bear to give up my car to get one of those new ones that looks like a colored squished marshmallow  well  maybe the Focus  not quite so round  My car is white with black trim  and blue interior  It s sporty looking  but not enough to attract the attention of police with radar  I would recommend it as an economy car and for couples  Though it could fit a family of four  there is probably not enough room if going on a long enough trip to need luggage  well  not without a rack on top br br  
Pos, At first  I wasn t very excited about getting my 1995 Ford Escort  I had just turned 16 and was hoping for something more along the lines of a V8 Camaro  or a big muddin  truck  Then as I drove my Escort more and more  I began to realize how much I really did appreciate its features  All my friends with those huge engines spend a small fortune in gas money  while my little 4 cylinder costs about  6 a week on average  I drive mainly to school and work  but sometimes I take trips all over the nation to race my bicycle  On the highway  the escort runs like a champ  It gets wonderful gas mileage  and it rides really nice and quiet  It can really move if you want it to  I have topped mine out at 135MPH  and it still managed its smooth ride  It felt like it was meant to be driven fast like that  I have only had a few minor mechanical problems with it  I have purchased a new set of tires  a fan belt  and a battery  The biggest problem that I have had is the brakes  I have spent a total of at least  500 replacing them  The first time  I bought all new brakes  pads  and cylinders  The second time  I decide to buy new pads  It has been over a month since the second trip to the shop  and they haven t squeeked yet  I would recommend the purchase of a 1995 Escort to anyone who wants an economical  quiet  and overall nice car  rather than someone who wants to drag race and spend  100 s fixing it up to make it nice br br  
Pos, There were two main reasons why I purchased this vehicle and why I will purchase it again  The first reason was price  This car was truly in my price range and I got a great deal from the dealer I purchased it from  My car payments were right were I needed them to be at the time  yet I had just purchased very dependable transportation and transportation that leads me to my second point on purchasing this vehicle  Very good gas mileage  This was extremely important because I drive 70 miles round trip daily to and from work  When I purchased the Escort gas prices were just about where they are now  approximately  1 25 a gallon  This vehicle has averaged approximately 37 miles to the gallon  so it is costing me less than  2 50 a day for gas  When I drive my other vehicle it costs me twice as much in gas As gas prices continue to go up  I would strongly recommend that people look at this vehicle for a very dependable and economical means of transportation br br  
Pos, I bought this car specifically for work  I transport disabled clients to and from job interviews  This vehicle has a lot of room without being too large  I hate driving tanks  This vehicle has been so good to me for the past 3 years  The maintenance required is low  I had to have a timing belt replaced at 85 000 miles  Other than that it has been oil changes  brakes  and tires  The usual repairs The only complaint I have at this time is the drivers side seat belt  It has gotten stuck in the middle of moving into the lock position  I had to disconnect the wiring at the base of the door  Otherwise it makes an annoying clicking sound  It cost over  200 to have this fixed  I have 3 friends who have escorts and this has been a problem with them also Other than that I have no complaints  It is a very reliable and trustworthy car  I never have any concerns when I take it on long road trips  I hope others find this vehicle as enjoyable br br  
Pos, My boyfriend has owned a  95 Ford Escort LX Wagon for almost two years now and it hasn t had any problems  When you see a Escort Wagon they re usually bought as business cars  ie Ikon  or family cars  There are many reasons for this  they re dependability and they re comfort  His car already has 185 000 miles on it  from road trips to Santa Cruz  and San Francisco  a lot of free way driving  but a lot of city wear too  Of the two years and probably 85 000 miles he put on it himself  there hasn t been a single problem  Giving it regular oil changes  and tune ups is the only expense you really have  You get about 25 mpg city and 30 freeway  The only problem with these cars  if you want to consider it a problem  is you can tell when it needs a service job  Like some cars that  quot try to let you know quot  when they need service by breaking down  this one gets a little little sluggish  as if to say  quot Ok  oil change please quot  or  quot Give me a tune up quot  If you re planning on buying your teen a car  or yourself  and don t have the money to spend loads on timing belts  radiators etc  This is the car to choose br br  
Pos, This car is FABULOUS  I can t stop raving about it  It is perfect for new parents  The four years that my husband and I have been married  we have driven a small compact car  When we found out we were expecting our first baby  we knew that we needed a new car with more room  I began having night mares of being a mini  van girl  and when I thought about getting a wagon  all I could think about was the Big green Brady Bunch Goose  I knew I had to make some changes in my life   now that I was going to be a mommy  but I wasn t prepared for the vehicle change  Praise the Lord  we came across the 1995 Ford Escort LX wagon  It is small and sleek enough to be simi  cool  and yet big enough to provide the much needed extra space  I love it  It gets great gas mileage and is so easy to handle  The heating and air systems are outstanding  It s great for the long trips back to my parents as well as the running around in town  This car is prefect for small families  especially new ones who are not ready for the mini van  but need more room than what a small car can offer br br  
Pos, The lease on our Ford Explorer was due to end in 5 months  150 my wife and I were planning on letting it lapse and replace it with another  smaller SUV The letter from Ford Motor Credit changed all that  Basically  their  147Early Bird 148 program would allow us to trade the Explorer in early  with Ford making the last 5 lease payments  if we bought or leased another Ford product  We hadn 146t thought too seriously about another Ford  but realized that our daughter was going to be 16 soon  so we thought that perhaps a Focus was in our future  So  off to the dealer we went Ford produces 4 different models of the Focus  a 2 door hatchback  ZX3  a 4 door hatchback  ZX5  a sedan and a traditional station wagon  Since the car was ultimately going to be our daughters  she came with us to help pick out  147her 148 car  The 2 door was out  as I felt it would be more expensive to insure than a 4 door vehicle  She immediately ruled out the wagon  which left the sedan and the 4 door hatchback  We drove one of each  and decided that the versatility of the hatchback was a nice feature not found on too many cars  That  plus the looks didn 146t scream  147Gramma mobile 148  with apologies to all grandmothers reading this It took trips to 4 different dealers  but we finally found one that we liked  a Sangria Red  burgundy to the rest of the world  ZX5 with a stick shift and ABS We 146ve had the car now for a couple of weeks and here are my impressions after 300 miles Styling  150 Interior and Exterior The Focus  particularly in hatchback form  has some interesting styling details  150 the car was designed when Ford was going through their  147New Edge 148 styling phase  the late Mercury Cougar was also a product of this era  The taillights  for example  are not at bumper level  but rather up in the rear pillars  on either side of the hatchback glass  Odd  but also strangely cool to my middle aged eyes  In addition  the red of our car almost  147hides 148 the taillights altogether during the day  Triangular headlamps at the front blend in to the character of the car as well  The use of angles and curves that intersect are also interesting  150 beauty is in the eye of the beholder  I suppose  but no one in my family dislikes the looks of the car The same theme dominates the inside of the vehicle as well  150 there are lots of diagonal slashes across the dashboard  and the organization of the stereo and HVAC controls is quite easy to master  My daughter  especially  liked the big digital readout of the stereo and how close it is to the driver  The only thing I find odd  and it seems to be endemic to Fords  is the lack of a redline mark on the tachometer  Especially for a new driver  knowing how fast the engine can rev before bad things start to happen is something pretty important Interior Space On our first test drive  I actually rode in the back seat  My wife drove  and our daughter rode shotgun  I was impressed by the amount of room I had  both for my legs and my head  I truly thought the sloping roof design of the hatchback was going to restrict headroom  but that wasn 146t the case  Now  I will admit that I could not see myself riding in the backseat on a cross country road trip  but for a trip of a few hours  I could be reasonably comfortable I actually did not get to drive the car for a few days  when I did  I was again surprised at how much room I had  The seats are height adjustable  on our trim level  which is known as  147Comfort 148  so I could put a couple of inches between the top of my head and the roof  The steering wheel adjusts for both reach and rake  meaning the wheel goes in and out as well as up and down   150 this translates into a driver 146s seat that 98  of the population should be able to get comfortable with  The gearshift falls readily to the right hand  and I 146ve already mentioned the stereo and HVAC controls  Sight lines are good  there really are not any major blind spots  150 again  something important for the first time driver  The only thing that takes a moment to get used to  150 and it is really only a problem if you have driven other stick shift equipped cars  150 is that to find reverse  a ring has to be pulled up on the gearshift before putting the gear lever into that spot  The first time my wife had to back up  she had to look up in the owner 146s manual how to do this The Driving Experience In Europe  the Focus is hailed by many of the car magazines as one of the best handling small cars available  Here in the United States  the Focus has been on Car and Driver magazine 146s  14710 Best Cars 148 for 5 straight years After driving the Focus  I can see why these accolades are heaped upon the Ford  For a small car  it goes  stops and turns quite nicely  Our ZX5 has the 2 0 liter  147Zetec 148 engine  which makes 130 horsepower  Completely adequate  I must say  Coupled with the smooth shifting 5 speed  the Focus has no problem getting out of its own way  The space between gears is nice and short  and the clutch action is smooth and predictable   again  nice traits for a first car We test drove a Focus with an automatic  and while that might have been a better fit for our daughter  my wife and I both believe that you have more control over your car with a stick shift  especially when poor weather hits  In addition  the automatic takes all the verve out of the engine  you practically have to floor it to keep the momentum up Ride and handling are also above par  While it won 146t ever be confused with a Lexus for ride quality or a BMW for carving corners  the Focus can more than hold its own  The suspension has evidently been tuned by Ford to strike a nice compromise between a cushy ride and good cornering capabilities  On the highway  the only complaint I might have is a bit too much road noise from the tires  Goodyear RS A  size 195 60 15  But  since the car will be used mainly for urban commuting  I don 146t see that as too much of a problem One last note  150 we got about 6 148 of snow last night  and my wife told me that driving the Focus to work this morning was really not too bad  150 the combination of the high seating position and the stick shift gave her the confidence to get to work with little or no drama  Summary For not a lot of money  about  15K in our case  we got a car filled with creature comforts  power windows  locks and mirrors  keyless remote  a CD MP3 player and cruise control  safety amenities  ABS and dual air bags  150 side air bags and traction control are optional  and enough character to hopefully keep our daughter safe and happy for many years to come  Our first tank of gas returned just over 29 miles per gallon  so it should be inexpensive to run  
Pos, I got the one that has 130 hp with the 2 0 liter engine  This is NOT the 143 hp  2 3 liter PZEV engine for late 2003 or 2004  This car is what I stated in the title The ride is extremely smooth  You feel like you are in a cockpit while driving  The front seat is the most comfortable I sat in  Sharp turns and the power steering are great  I get 26  mpg for phenomenal power  Before I got it I tried out some luxury sports cars  I see NO difference  With it s compact size it is easier to go between cars and fit into cramped parking spaces when necessary  This is the best hatchback or compact car Now for the downs to put up with if you are single  With a 5 speed s power can lag a little going up steep hills  Passengers in the backseat will find little leg room  Have up to one passenger regularly especially for long trips  For my trunk I had to buy a  3 in 1  toolbox at the hardware store for  30 and a  4 plastic box at K Mart For a small car with great power and handling the 2003 Ford Focus is as good as it gets  Other hatchbacks or compact cars weigh more  claim to give more miles per gallon  and have a smaller hood area  Expect costly and time consuming repairs in the long run with other little cars  
Pos, After two station wagons and two minivans  Chryslers  we wondered if moving to a big SUV would be the right move  Our question now is  why did we wait so long  While minivans are quite practical for families with younger children  lower floors  easier entry  walk thru access from the front seats  our eight seat Expedition is perfect for our junior high and high school aged children  Not only does is suit their need to not be seen in a minivan  it affords them much more legroom and space for their bookbags  soccer balls  and extra friends  Although access to the far back seat is a bit cumbersome  kids have a hard time determining which of three levers need to be unlatched to move the mid seat out of the way the slightly elevated aft seat offers all occupants a good view up ahead  Our Eddie Bauer edition comes with efficient dual zone air conditioning with rear seat controls and radio CD buttons and headphone jacks which keeps them busy and quiet in the passenger compartment  Before we committed to the Expedition  we drove it home to see if it would fit into our garage  We found out that not only did it fit nicer than our old Grand Caravan  it was also much easier to maneuver into the garage due to it s speed sensitive power assisted steering  The higher driving position and large windows also seem to make visibility better than our Caravan  On the down side  our Expedition cost thousands of dollars more than the minivan  and has averaged 12 7 mpg in the course of running the kids all over town  It s rugged styling and aggresive tires are probably more suitable for at least a bit of off road driving  but I don t know if more comfortable  fuel efficient tires would ruin the overall appeal  It is an SUV for heavens  sake  We intend to keep the Expedition until our oldest daughter goes off to college next year  Then with only two of our four children remaining at home  we may take a closer look at something a bit more practical  That new Selectronic transmission  V 8 equipted Lincoln LS seems to have my name written all over it br br  
Pos, Well maybe not PERFECT for cruising for chicks  but that may be better  since I ll have my two kids in the back seat  But seriously  the Ford Expedition is an all around great time We bought the Expedition because we wanted something to accommodate our 4 member family  the car seats  shopping bags  toys  games and the occasional grandparent  The Expedition fits them all in nicely  no problem  and often all at the same time Roomy  glamorous  stylish and comfortable  the Ford Expedition is an S U V of many faces  Wash it up  wax it down  put on your Sunday best and you can show up at the most elegant of gatherings next to Ferraris and Bentleys and no one would look twice  Throw your bikes in the back  the kids in the car seats  cruise to McD s for a happy meal and you ll fit right in  It is the only car I know of with multiple personality disorder  it doesn t know what the hell it is The Expedition drives with almost no effort whatsoever  it practically drives itself  You can steer with one finger if you like living on the edge  and the braking is no problem for even the smallest of parents  Headroom and legroom are topnotch  I should know  being 6 9 quot  I don t fit into many cars  but the Ford Expedition was made just for me The one drawback is the price of gas  and with a fuel slurping V 8  expect many trips to the pump  But with all the room  stylish look and comfort the Ford Expedition hands out  I won t be complaining about gas for too long  and neither will you We own the Black Eddie Bauer version with the tan leather interior  and it is elegance all the way home  The sounds system pumps  the passing power is awesome  and the drive is smooth as silk If you have the need  head over to you Ford dealer and take a test drive  you might just pay the dealer from the driver s seat and never get out br br  
Pos, I m sorry to say that the Ford Expedition I am writing about is not my own  it is my mother s  We bought it last year after our 8 year old Ford Aerostar died  This is one of the best cars I have ever driven and one of the biggest  You cannot drive this thing if you are used to driving anything smaller than a light truck  which includes most import sedans and sub compacts  This car commands the road  Not only are you sitting higher than you are in most cars  this car is only 2 quot  narrower than national highway specifications on minimum lane width  If you swerve back and forth in your lane often  get ready for an accident  With the Expedition  you have to keep it in line 100  of the time  You have to feel powerful when you are driving this car  you are in complete control of the road Well  not only is this car have some muscle  it has versatility  convenience  and luxury  Two rear 3 person seats plus the two front seats make this an 8 seater  The back seat sits up an extra 6 quot  over the front seat  but the ceiling is also lifted 4 quot  to allow for proper headroom  There are these very cool little air conditioning vents coming out of the ceiling  which can be pointed in any direction or closed off completely  If your kids want to listed to the radio  but you would like a nice quiet conversation in the front  just bring some headphones  The kids can plug in the headphones in the back and listen to their own tunes while the adults have a conversation in the front  There are a total of 4 headphone jacks  two for each 3 person seat  Both of the 3 person seats are removable  so taking provisions on any trip is not a problem  Skis  hockey equipment  and in our case  soccer equipment has plenty of room  There are a total of 8 cupholders  although one requires that part of a seat be in the down position  It has a keyless entry system and can be set to automatically lock when the keys get 20 feet away from the car     
Pos, I ordered a New Eddie Bauer in the Fall of 98  1999 Model  The reason i waited is because of the HP increase and the Torque increase on the New Triton engine  I pull a 23  Sea Ray boat which weighs over 4000lbs and felt I needed the extra power to handle the load  The expedition handles it very well  We added all the bells and whistles ie adjustable peddles for the short wife  power drivers seat for me  6 disc CD changer  Always get all the toys because it helps resale  I am glad Ford finally switched from the twin I Beam suspension  The new system will work much better  The ride is comfortable  like sitting up above the other traffic especially at night  Gas milage is not bad  received 13 6 mpg on recent trip out west  I also own a 1995 Ford F150 Eddie Bauer that does not do as good on milage so i guess the 13 mpg is not bad  I waited for the new Excursion to come out but Ford kept delaying  After looking at the new Excursion I am glad I bought the Expedition     
Pos, We recently purchsed this truck after years of driving a small to mid sized vehicle this was a huge change  But after having our 3rd baby we needed something to haul everyone around in  I am not a  mini van chick  I flat out refused to drive one so my husband and I started investigating the SUV s  After months of reading  talking and searching we decided on the Ford Expedition Im very please with it  I was a little worried about how I would handle a large vehicle but it is surprisingly easy to drive  parking is a wee but tight on occasion but so far I havent had a huge problem  We opted for the 4x2 XLT version  really no need for the 4x4 when driving to the super market and school  plus thats just one extra thing that could go wrong in the future  Ours has all the bells and whistles including the rear air  which is a great thing when you have 3 kids in the back  I was advised to get the  big  motor  the 5 4 liter but we ended up with the 4 6  which has PLENTY of power and is much easier on the gas bill  Though my husband claims he wants to put a super charger in it I think not  It has the 3rd row of seats which was a huge selling point for me  my children are now seperated and have zero reason to fight no more  MOM  he s touching me  it is so very peaceful and makes me much more relaxed nothing worse than a stressed mom behind the wheel The only down fall is that there isnt a whole lot of cargo space when the 3rd seat is in  We recently took a trip for the weekend  all of us  and it was packed to the hilt  especially since we have an infant and god knows they need so much equipment when away from home I would highly recommend this truck to anyone who wants the space of a mini van without the minivan look  
Pos, I didn quot t buy it  I leased it  I leased it to try it out because I had a 1997 ford explorer and I wasn t happy  The explorer wasn t what ford raved about  It was very noisy  lack of power  and the new 4 6 overhead cam engine had alot of problems  Over the two years I had this vechile I was at the dealer 41 times  for recalls and noises  When I went to the dealership to give back the explorer I looked at the expedition and I really liked what I saw  The truck had alot of room  It s standard equipment had alot to offer  and the price seemed to be right  Compared to the explorer where I was paying  443 00 per month  and now I could pay  5 00 more per month for more vehicle  When I picked up the truck a day later and left the dealership I couldn t get over the ride  It was like night and day  the expedition handled nice and tight  It wasn t noisy  But I thought to myself let s see what happens in a couple of months  Well after two years I m still waiting  Don t get me wrong I have had some problems but very minor  The rear wiper stop working due to a loose wire  There was a recall on the signal switch  and on the tires which were rectified immediatly  Those were the only times I been to the dealership in the two years  except for regular maintence I would highly recommend this vehicle to anybody who likes a low maintence vehicle  But most of all I would recommend this vehicle to the big family or for the person who needs alot of room and wants a really nice comfortable ride instead of getting a big oversized chevy thats very tinny and sloppy     
Pos, i first had a new ford expedition 3years ago 1997xtl silver i had never driven anything like it before  it handled and rode like large car and not a big truck  but the biggest surprise came on december day with the first light snow with five o clock traffic when a little white car slid in front of me from the second lane on an exit ramp leading to another superhighway  With no space to stop  and not wanting to squash the smaller car to pieces  I swerved with complete control to a small space between the end of the lane I was in and guard rail to keep vehicles from falling down an incline  In a split second I was around the white car  proceeding in front of it on a curve toward the superhighway  I never lost control and everything about the Expedition responded better than any vehicle I have ever been in  It truly saved my life and the life of the driver of the white car  I drove that same Expediton for two years and 30 000 miles  It went through snow  ice  off terrain encounters and was finally turned back in two years later  I immediately went out and purchased a new 1999 Eddie Bauer Ford Expedition and found the same type of feeling of security and the fantastic ability to see around everything else  and have heard a number of stories of expeditions that have survived tremendous crashes with the occupants able to walk away  One other special is it comes equipped with a fantastic cd radio cassette system  it s truly a fantastic vehicle br br  
Pos, I Love my Ford Expedition  I purchased my expedition in August 1999 and have been driving it since  I have two kids who are involved in all sports and this car has been the best for transporting them from place to place  There is more than enough room for anything needed  balls  equipment etc  This car is very dependable and comfortable  The gas mileage is not the best  but what do you expect for a big vehicle  It is a great vehicle to travel in not only is it spacious  but all the extras are wonderful  I recently traveled eight hours with my two kids and it sure was nice for each kid to have their own seat and their own air controls  I even felt safe on the freeway  The expedition also has good suspension and brake pedals to adjust to the driver  Before purchasing the Expedition  I test drove other SUV s and I have to say this is the best in it s class  After being in the Expedition other SUV s felt generic to me especially the Chevy Tahoe  But then  what do you expect from CHEVY br br  
Pos, Okay  I ll admit it  I used to be a mom in a mini van  and now I ve become something even more dreaded  a mom in a big  horkin  Expedition But guess what  This car is a dream car  not only because it s comfortable and it drives well  but also because whenever I drive it  other people in itty bitty cars actually move out of my way Maybe it s the way I weave precariously in and out of lanes  or maybe it s just because I m in a car that s large enough to run down a Tercel and barely leave a mark  Whatever  I love being the biggest car in the carpool lane  I love the way my window aligns with the McDonald s drive through window just right  And I love that I m surrounded by what feels like tons of ice green steel My kids are safe  I m safe  and what else can I say  I m BIG br br  
Pos, this vehicle is safe  i love the 4 wheel drive which is almost slip thru in the weather we are having right now  driving this car is like riding a cloud  the ride is calm and not bumpy i recommend this to tall people and people who love to half some fun on the streets  the car can handle in tough situation like snow and mud the inside is roomy  the back seat is even comfortable enough to sit in  It cost is well for a vehicle this size too  the car is equiped with a A4WD  4H or 4L so u can set up your driving style  the car is also big enought to carry loads of camping stuff or boxes to work  it s acar suitable for every person a workamn or fun having person or BOTH br br  
Pos, After several MB s  two different sets of Jaguars  yes  one to drive and one to leave at the shop  Audis  mine never self propelled  and other brands too numerous to mention  both foreign and domestic  I have to admit I ve never had more fun or comfort that I get from my 1999 Expedition4Wd Eddie Bauer I d like it even more if the dealer could fix the AWD  which  when activated  manages to blink the  quot AWD ON quot  indicator like a turn signal  but what the heck  I ve still got 4WD Hi and Lo  so I m not really upset despite the 4 unsuccessful tries  now they say they have the right parts in stock and will repair it next time I drop by for routine service At 28 000 miles the car  truck  looks and drives like it did when it was brand new  That means  among other things  it still gets 12 mpg  And I still scrunch down in my seat when I m in indoor parking garages because the combined extra height from the 17 inch wheels and the roof rack produces a nerve jarring 6 7 quot  profile that some day may become a convertible when one of those overhead garage beams is a few inches lower than the sign at the entrance says it is  clearance on my at home garage door frame is about two inches   phew  Recommended accessory   a third seat prop bar that lets you leave the seat in while propping it up to reclaim stowage space  For  49 95 you can get one at http www knoxx com Good sound system  nice leather  good trimwork and  overall  a very comfortable ride in town and on the freeway  It s almost enough to make you believe that when Ford claims  quot Quality is job  1 quot  they mean it br br  
Pos, We bought this vehicle because it was newer  we got a good deal  and it holds more passengers We LOVE the way it handles  We had an Explorer before  which really was fun  but the Expedition handles like a large  luxury automobile  not a truck  AND it s attractive and incredibly roomy We really can fit everyone in  My husband  myself and my son  6  and 300 lbs  two step daughters  husband  brother and two nephews  oh AND my dog  Truffles We tolerate the gas useage and it s size can be a bummer when it comes to parking availability for compact cars  There needs to be more parking spaces for SUV s since they are increasing in popularity Don t buy this car if you have no where to park it  but that s the ONLY reason NOT to buy If you have to schlepp anyone around  if you need space for cargo  this is the vehicle for you I wouldn t part with it for any other SUV or truck br br  
Pos, Ah yes  behold  another rental car review   With my Sentra SE in the shop  don t worry  just a little fender bender  I now get a chance to review another car  This time  it is the Ford Focus LX   Although it doesn t say so in the back I wonder if this is the same car that another one of our beloved reviewers drove  as it is the same Cloud Nine White colour  and I m in the same  Bay  area  Then again  I m sure Enterprise has a fleet of these cars anyways  as they make great cheap rental cars  Too bad the Prius can t make it  it d be great for renting thanks for it sipping gas conservitively The car that was given me was just washed and clean  with 18K miles on the odometer  Going thru the glove box reviled the manual  which informs me that it is a 2001 model  Oh  did I mention that the interior was funky  I mean it SMELLED funky  and a bit dirty  too  Oh well  that s what happens after 18K worth of previous drivers b Exterior  This is a very attractive car from the outside  It looks very much European  because it was designed there  by the way  and it also have the build quaility of one  Not bad for a base econo car  It has sharp lines and curves  much like a Volkswagen has  Small 14  steel wheels with covers makes the car screem  I m cute  as the body looks like it needs a little more support from a larger set of wheels The front fascia looks aggressive  but can still be mistaken for a Dodge Neon at night  thanks to the position of the turn signals  The back  however  reminds me of the newly designed Honda Civic  except that the lights actually glow in a circle  instead of a tranversed  U Oh  let s not forget the antenna    The cute little antenna in front center of the roof  like most European cars do  VW  The only thing missing that would make it even more Euro like are sidemarkers b Interior  How can I put it  it s  interesting It looks a bit of a mess  like someone just thrown it together  And even if not  it looks more like a Picaso painting if anything else  It certainly matches the exterior well  with sharp lines and curves  triangles  etc  About the only thing normal looking are the gauges  Sadly  the base LX does not have a tachameter  which makes the instrument panel look a bit plain Front seats are confortable  but not too supportive  And  for some reason  saftey reason  the steering wheel is a bit off from center  making it awkward to drive once you notice it  Rear seats are surprisingly confortable  and was able to lull passengers to sleep in a long road trip  Just let only 2 adults back there and no more  please  While not spacious  leg room is surprisingly adaquate as well Visibility does pose a bit of a problem  the side mirrors are too small  while the rear window shares the same problem  The rearview mirror is small as well  and barely covered the entire rear window  The view to the back makes the car seem like it has a butt that is very jacked up  And I do mean UP  Seems the rear is pretty high for a compact car b Creature Comforts  The stereo is one item most will reach out for  and it will only disapoint if alll you carried to your trip are CDs  Standard issue radio cassette just doesn t cut it  The volume is not very gradule  as it steps up and down in VERY DISCRETE STEPS  Going from 1  very audible  to 0 gets you very frustrated  as you can t have anything else inbetween  The 1 setting is still very audible when the car is stopped at a red light  and sounds as if you can still lower it a little more  No fine volume tuning for you  buster The stereo also comes with an anti theft device  how very insulting to car stereo thieves  as a section of the radio preset buttons can be taken with you  The whole anti theft unit can be stored like a pen in your pocket  as there is a pen like clip built in  Gee how thoughtful Strange thing is  it does have one  luxo  feature  which is the automatic volume speed control  or whatever Ford calls it  As you drive faster  the volume gets louder  When you stop  it comes back down  Very annoying  actually  and fortunately  can be turned off  GM cars are having it everyone on their cars  though  Seen one on a Pontiac Sunbird too  Yes  that s an econo rental car  as well The speakers are very boomy and clear  These are the best speakers I ve ever heard on a car being stock  This is very surprising  as it is the most basic system  with only 4 speakers on the doors  Perhaps it is the placement of it  Who knows most cars have the rear speakers on the rear dash  and I guess putting it on the rear doors make that much of a difference  Highs are clearly high  while lows can be felt  I could swear there is an aftermarket sub somewhere hidden in the car Now for the windows and locks  all manual  This car is completely backwards  The locks are LOCKED when the tab is not flush with the handles  Weird  huh  Most car manufacturers with tab locks would have it LOCKED when the tab is flush with the handle door  and UNLOCKED when the tab is stickin  out or just look like it is crying out for attention  sticks out  The Focus is totally backwards  Same for the window cranks  To open the windows  you must pretend you are CLOSING it  and crank it that way  In otherwords  you must crank it AWAY from you to open  while in other cars  that s the way to close windows manually The locks are very confusing  especially since it is manual  as everyone HAS TO LOCK THE DOOR  I can t trust anyone when I ask them  did you lock the doors  All say  YES  but when I checked  all were still unlocked  Hmm The climate controls are a bit easier to contend with  However  the AC and recirculate buttons are positioned too low  which makes it a bit of a hassle to drive and look at where your fingers are hitting b The Drive  I m very surprised to find out that this 2 0 liter engine puts only 110 hp  It must be the torque  being at 125 lb ft   3750 RPMs  That gives this engine the power to move quickly from stops  which is very evident from the moment you step on the pedal  Acceleration is quick  even when you are already moving  The 4 speed automatic is not smooth at times  but still gets the job done  When driven conservitively  however  you won t be able to notice it  I guess the jerking is for those people who enjoy feeling it when they push the car hard  But keep in mind  this is suppose to be an automatic  Automatics are suppose to be smooth and seamless  The transmission also allows the driver to turn off overdrive  which does not allow the transmission to use 4th gear  I never found the need to turn it off  really  If you wanted to downshift  just hit the pedal HARD  The only real need for it is if you need to be in 3rd constantly  like if you were towing something  or dragging something from behind though I don t know who would be doing that   whistles innocently The engine is sooo torquey  that I squealed the tires very easily on dry pavement   Keep in mind that this is an automatic  Then again  it may just be bad slippery tires  as they squeal even on mild curves like on and off ramps  Then again  I may be driving it a tad faster than most consider comfortable  which isn t that bad  HEY  my car doesn t squeal like a pig  The body rolls as well when taking corners  but nothing that would make the ride uncomfortable  After all  people who own this base car don t usually drive like this anyways   Old Kia commercial    Don t worry  honey it s a rental  You may just want to get the sportier ZTS  or the ZX3 hatchback   Perhaps it s the last driver that trashed it  but  the brakes are VERY noisey and feels uneven  I say this because it felt like a warped rotor  so I can t really comment on how the brake feels without finding out if it truely are the brakes  They do stop the car confidently  but shakes like hell  This is NOT ABS  people  as it isn t even included here  Front plow for stopping this car quickly does show up with revenge  however  The suspension is super soft  considering the body roll and front plow For such a soft suspension  it sure does let a lot of road noise in  I have never heard such loud road noise  You can barely listen to the radio  or even hold a conversation with your passengers  We had to yell at the top of our lungs  Below 60 MPH  however  and it s bareable b Conclusion  Only if you can live with it  I say  I sure do hope the higher trims fix most of the glaring annoyances of this car  but just as I said about the Dodge Neon  it s a good rental  Make sure you sugar coat it if you want to buy it I don t exactly know what the 2001 price is  but for 2002  the base LX is  13 220  but I doubt that price includes AC or automatic transmission  I think as the other reviewer I mentioned who probably drove the exact same car I drove  it was probably  14 400 as tested  
Pos, I needed a vehicle with enough room to seat 4 people  2 in car seats  Four doors was something of a must as the extra 2 doors help to make the process of buckling in youngsters go a little smoother  I also wanted something that would be easy on gas as I do a lot of driving  My search did not start out with the Focus in mind  rather I looked at and test drove most of the cars in its class before making a decision  The main selling point for us on this vehicle was the test drive  The car surprised me at how quiet it is and the ride was also good for a small car  Gas mileage on the sticker was posted as 28 city  and 36 highway  The only thing I was not impressed with on the test drive was the visibility but I ll get to that later  A quick check to see how the car seats fit in the back and the rest was a matter of settling on a final price with our local dealer  After owning the Focus for about a month I am still very happy with my choice but there are a few gripes I have with this vehicle  The exterior styling of the sedan version leaves a bit to be desired in my opinion but also contributes to two shortcomings  I can t see the front end of the car nor can I see the back end  from the drivers seat  Pay close attention to this on the test drive as it may prove to be unacceptable to some drivers  The base engine is adequate for the flat terrain where I live but I d opt for the stronger Zetec option if I lived in a hilly or mountainous region  I would also have preferred an extra inch of cleaning surface on the drivers side windshield wiper  One thing to keep in mind when car shopping in this class is the list of standard options  I believe Ford was a little stingy in this respect  Aside from floor mats  rear defrost  interior trunk release  passive anti theft system and AM FM cassette most of the other standard options on the LX sedan are very basic  If you want ABS  AC  automatic transmission  etc  you ll need to add potentially expensive options  Fortunately the gripes have been mild and my overall impression remains high  The 5 speed transmission and clutch have proven thus far to be the smoothest I have used  The car does not have a workmanship defect that I have found and has not needed any repair  The mixed bag of driving I do has yielded almost 32mpg  Driving position is comfortable and the air conditioner has been more than up to the job  According to our insurance agent rates for this vehicle are pretty much average for a small car  As a final bonus the trunk holds more than I expected from a car in this class although the high trunk probably contributes to the lack of rear visibility  If you re in the market for a small car you ll of course want to check out epinions com but might also want to take a look at http carpoint msn com homepage default asp You can check specs  rebate information  pricing  invoice and retail  check safety ratings  compare with similar vehicles  etc  
Pos, I absolutely love my 2000 Ford Focus wagon  I bought it because my old car died and I really wanted an SUV  but could not stomach paying almost  2 00 per gallon of gas to fill one up all the time  Or for that matter  higher insurance premiums  This car gets 32 mpg on the highway  I needed room in my car for our mountain bikes  Surprise  It comes  not an option  with an adjustable roof rack that was extremely easy to outfit with two bike racks  There is nothing I don t like about this car  however an all wheel drive option would be great because I do take it on dirt roads  All the better to access trailheads  It is a blast to drive  handles wonderfully  and has alot more power than I expected out of a four cylinder car  Very zippy  I did get the ZETEC engine  so it has a little more power than the standard engine  I recommend this car for anyone considering an SUV but who may   and shouldn t we all  have reservations about their environmental impact  Less emissions  less gas  And really now  how often do you take that 4x4 SUV off road  People who should not buy this car are those of you who follow the adage  quot Bigger is Better quot  I have all the room I need  Even if we do have kids in a year or so br br  
Pos, My 2001 Ford Focus ZX3 just passed the 1500 mile mark and I love driving it  I chose Twilight Blue w  Medium Graphite interior  It s a great combination  I like how there is a patterned appearance in the center of the seats I also have the Power and Premium option packages  as well as the manual moonroof  I m not a big fan of having to order a whole range of options in one big package  but I think every car company does that now  The Power package gives you Keyless entry   which is great when you ve got an armful of groceries or packages  you can just hit the blue trunk release and up goes the hatch  Well  it doesn t exactly go up  but it does open enough for you to nudge it up into full open position  Also included are power windows  mirrors  and locks The Premium package includes air conditioning  front center armrest  speed control  map lights  tilt telescoping steering wheel  P205 50R16 tires  16 inch 6 spoke aluminum wheels The armrest is nice  but I have to say that they don t exactly give you a plethora of storage space inside  A bit skimpy I think  I d like to have been able to put my CD s inside the armrest And as I said  I ordered the manual moonroof  At first I was leaning away from it  Part of me thought a manual moonroof would be cheap  but it really isn t  You can fully open it  or crank it the other way and just use it to get some fresh air in the car without completely messing up your hair  I don t like the cupholders and the changeholder  The cupholders are placed in an awkward position and make it a chore to remove your beverage  The changeholder is high up on the dash and is very small   it s cumbersome to remove coins The seats are extremely comfortable  They have side bolsters which give you the feeling of being held in place  but not in an overly restrictive way  I just feel secure and I like that  Also  with the manual seat height adjustment and the tilt telescopic steering wheel it s easy for even a shorty like me to have a great view of the road and not have my chin touching the steering wheel  My Dad sat in it  he s got a Lincoln Towncar and is a  big car  kind of guy  and he had plenty of room also My ZX3 is a 5 speed  which I would recommend because I think manual transmissions are just more fun to drive  A bit of a pain to learn  but once you don t you ll love it   unless you frequently get stuck in long traffic  then you may not love it quite as much as you continually shift from 1st to 2nd  The Zetec engine coupled with the stick shift gives tons of zip  I find myself speeding frequently and having to slow down   sometimes the car just gets away from me a little  Breaking has not been an issue  it stops just fine I m not a gearhead so I can t get into specifics about engine performance and specifications  All I know is that I adore this car inside and out and look forward to driving it every day  
Pos, To begin  I should say that this car was not my first choice  My heart was set on a new Honda Civic  I had test driven the new 2 door coupe and had fallen in love  and after the problems I had experienced with my  94 Jetta  the review is at  a href auto review 6ED0 CE1F0E5 3A1D7F4C prod4 tk CB008 1 13 http www epinions com auto review 6ED0 CE1F0E5 3A1D7F4C prod4 tk CB008 1 13 a  if you re interested  I wanted a car with a reputation for reliability  Not only that  from witnessing problems other family members had been faced with with their own Ford vehicles  I had decided that Ford wasn t even worth considering  Finally after dealership after dealership refusing to give me what I needed for my Jetta in a trade in  I was still financed up to my neck  I ended up test driving a Ford Focus  only half seriously  But not only did they offer me what I needed for my trade in  they also had a program where they will add up to  4000 onto the purchase price of the vehicle  and give it to you in a cheque so that you can go on a trip or pay credit cards or whatever you feel like doing with it  Seeing as the Jetta ran up my credit cards significantly  and this was the perfect opportunity to unload the thing  I jumped on it  and managed to bargain them down to close to invoice price  I ve only owned it since mid May  but so far no regrets My Focus is a Fort Knox Gold SE  with the standard 110hp 2 0 litre SPI engine and manual transmission  It has loads of standard equipment  such as A C  CD player  and remote keyless entry   everything my Jetta had and more  The one I bought had the  Comfort Group  which included map lights  tilt telescopic steering wheel  and cruise control  I don t think I would have bothered with this package had I ordered the car from the factory  but I love the tilt telescopic wheel  Unfortunately the cruise control hasn t worked from the beginning  and I ve been waiting 3 weeks now for parts  Very annoying  because though this is not a life or death option  I have to wonder if all parts take this long to come in Now though I haven t owned this car very long  I ve put almost 5000kms on it already  so now that it s reasonably well broken in  I feel I can write a decent opinion about it I ll start with the transmission  Before I bought this car I had never driven a manual tranny  so I can t really compare it to anything  I do know that it took me no time to figure it out and I can get some beautifully smooth shifts out of it  Far smoother than the Jetta s clunky automatic tranny  I let my parents drive it from time to time if I don t need it  and they both could go on for hours about how nicely this car shifts and how positive it is  The one thing that I could have really used while learning to drive it is a tachometer  I have no idea if I am over revving the thing and it s a bit unnerving  The  shift up  indicator is a joke  It comes on at the stupidest times and if you follow it the car lurches and lugs constantly  I try to ignore it and go roughly by what the owners manual says  but even then it seems like it s too soon  I have found it goes best if I shift at 10 15kph higher than what the manual says  and I still get over 500kms on a tank of gas  so not too shabby  The Jetta had a bigger gas tank and I was lucky to get 400kms out of it  I m still getting used to stop and go traffic so as I get better at that I suspect I ll get even better mileage in the city  however I am doing much less highway driving than I was a month ago  it accounted for about 20  of my kilometres  now maybe 5  at best  so I doubt I ll see much of a difference in my gas mileage Now to the engine performance handling  This thing is loud  Good for knowing when to shift  but takes away from the initial refined feel of the car  Fortunately there is a really cool feature on the stereo that pumps the volume up to compensate for the engine noise  The car has pretty good pick up as far as I am concerned  but keep in mind that before the Jetta I drove a 3 cylindar Subaru Justy for 7 years so I m used to sluggish cars  I think this car would keep up with my old Jetta  but not on hills  Especially mountain highways  It s rather pathetic  even if you shift down  Since I don t have a tachometer I am not comfortable experimenting with shifting down again  so I live with it  On the flat road the car handles 140kph quite nicely  Even though it is a relatively tall car  it seems to hug the road and handles curves beautifully  And that stereo just keeps pumping out exceptional sound The interior is wonderful  So smooth and sleek  feels way richer than it really is  Just don t look too closely  Some seams are uneven  and parts like the air vents feel like you could just pull them right out with little effort   my friends and I are thinking of betting on how long it will take before the window handles break off  But then when it comes to this stuff I am rather picky  Where the shift console meets the carpet really bothers me  It looks like someone just cut the plastic quickly with scissors  As far as roominess goes  I am very pleased  The bucket seats are slightly hollowed in the back so that knees don t press into the front passengers  backs so to offer extra leg room  there s lots of head room   even my 6 2  boss had room to spare   and you don t feel like you re going to bash elbows with the person beside you  I don t know that I d try to fit 3 people in the back  but with the middle seat having a shoulder belt I would feel safe doing it  It already has a couple rattles  which are annoying  but not unbearable  though it is disappointing that they have started this early in the car s life Trunk space is huge  And if someone manages to get locked in the trunk  there s a glow in the dark handle which can be pulled to open it from the inside  So far none of my friends have volunteered to try this little feature out  the chickens  To make the back seats lie flat you have to pull knobs in the trunk  Not sure if I like that or not  I guess it s nice that anything in the trunk is secure  I m just used to doing it from inside the car I have to say I am very happy I bought this car so far  It has far exceded my expectations for Ford cars  It has also been a good replacement for the Jetta as it has most of the features the Jetta did  plus a few extra  I would recommend this car to anyone as disgusted with VW as I am  young people just out of college  or young families  If you re a speed demon  you ll probably want to upgrade to the Zetec engine  It s not expensive  and it gives you 130hp which is 20hp more than the SPI  My only regret is that I didn t upgrade to that engine  
Pos, When the Focus was announced as the replacement to the popular Ford Escort  I must admit  I had my doubts  After years of 1980 s domination where nearly every drive in the country had a Sierra  Escort or Fiesta on it  Ford were struggling to keep up with the cheaper and more reliable Japanese models that flooded the market in the 1990 s  Ford were losing shed loads of money to its competition in Europe and still is  So was the Focus really the market saviour  Well  no  I dont think it was or is  In the mid 90 s when it first hit the streets I just thought   Oh my god  what is that ugly thing  Yet it seems to have spawned a whole host of ugly mobiles from various manufacturers  The straight orderly lines of 80 s cars had been replaced by uneven and ugly curves that appeared to have come straight off the concept board  Ok it had been beaten to the medium size car market by the even uglier and more wierd Fiat Brava and Bravo but this was the first major player to make a statement  Looks    Looking at the car from the outside makes you think   hang on  from the front it looks just like a Fiesta Ka  Well it does with its sloping pointy angry looking headlights and oval grille  Moving back along the doors  they seem to take up the majority of the side panels  Its the rear of the car that really confuses me  It is possibly the ugliest monstrosity to come out of the design house at Dunton  Essex  No Boot  well it is a hatchback  But it is all part of the rear of the car  I liken it to the equally confused looking Nissan Almera for stragest boot in the world prize  It looks like it has had a rear end shunt and the lights have ended up somewhere at the top of the car  I dont like this  Interior    Typical Ford plastic adorns the interior  All Fords smell the same  Plastic  The dash is very arty with its White Dials that are so common today  The stereo takes up most of the centre console and looks a nightmare if you want to install an after market unit  Thankfully the people who supplied the stereo  Visteon  have done themselves proud by making a half decent effort at the sound system  This is something Ford s have lacked for sometime  Handling    Suprisingly good  Traction control really helps out the wheelspin and ABS stops you when you ask  No skidding or slipping here  The Semi Stiff shocks give you a nice level ride but can be a bit severe on your bad back if you hit the bumps  Still  a nice drive on the motorway  Acceleration    After driving both the 1 6 and 1 8 models  you can notice a pulling difference between these cars  The 1 8 allows you to pull into the traffic when you want rather than wait for a gap big enough  Its no neck breaker but ample for most people  thats because it has its power supplied by one of the best engines in the market  The Zetec  Safety    It held up well in crash test and does come with both Driver and Passenger air bags  Overall    Id give this 7 out of 10  Handles good  drives nice but a bit ugly  Im afraid I dont think it was the saviour Ford wanted  Information    Visit the website to check it out further  www ford co uk Fer are some stats for you  1 8 Zetec 0 60mph time   8 8 seconds Power output   125 hp   6000 rpm Fuel Consumption  41mpg on Motorway  28 on Urban  
Pos, I recently rented one of the new Ford replacement for the Escort  and lets just say that Ford is still making progress in their small car designs The Focus that I rented was a SE 4 door sedan that was heavily optioned  It did come equipped with the standard 2 0 liter engine that had been used in the Escort  Having owned a 94 Escort wagon with a manual transmission and over 175 000 trouble free mind  the Focus would be considered for a replacement Ford seems to have solved the noise and vibration problems that plagued the Escort  The Focus idles silently and smoothly without the rear view mirror shake that I have become accustomed to in my personal car  Although the engine now is rated at 110 horsepower  the low end torque of the engine is such that it seems more powerful than it really is  The seating position is higher than in the Escort and I found no real blind spots  Around town the power with the optional automatic transmission is ideal for city conditions  and is not bad on the highway either  as I had cruised at 85 mph and the vehicle tracked straight and true and was immune to cross winds  Compared to the 2001 Chevrolet that I had rented earlier in the year  the Focus was actually superior on the highway and the seating position lets one get a better focus on the road ahead of you  Handling and braking are very  very good  but gas mileage is lower than what the Escort could achieve  but is still over 30mpg on the highway But there is no such thing as a perfect car  despite what anyone thinks  The funky interior and exterior design takes some getting used to  and I guess that it would have to grow on you  The interior now places the stereo system above the heat and a c controls as opposed to the opposite in the old Escort  and that is a welcomed change as one generally will fiddle with the radio more than the climate control system  The optional CD player takes up a lot of real estate on the dash and the controls are somewhat confusing  The ash try is placed right behind the steering wheel and is difficult to find in the day and down right impossible to find at night  The cup holders are down really low and difficult to reach  I also don t like the self locking feature that causes the car to lock all the doors when one reaches about 10 mph  I am quite capable of locking the doors myself  thank you very much I would have to put this vehicle high on the list though of the best of the breed in the small car world  and considering that I have recently also driven a new Toyota Corrolla  to me the Toyota is hard to justify for  3000 more  
Pos, I purchased a 2001 Ford Focus ZX3  S2 model  not too long ago and I absolutely love it  I couldn t ask for a better vehicle  I previously owned a 1999 Mercury Cougar  It was a great car until it started having problems  I haven t had a single problem with the ZX3 yet  Ford really did a great job designing the Focus  It has a sporty yet sophisticated look to it  The model I bought had a MSRP of  16420  This included everything that I wanted  convenience group  power group  and S2 group  which I greatly recommend for  600  The S2 group includes premium 16  wheels and 50 series tires  premium gauges  S2 diamond pattern seats  6 disk in dash cd changer  bucket seats  rear spoiler  chrome exhaust tip  European tuned suspension  and everything that the sports group offers  Not a bad deal for  600  The other groups included power everything and such amenities as A C  keyless entry  tilt and telescoping steering wheel  cruise control  etc  As you can tell  it is a lot for the money  There is no other car that offers this much at a reasonable price  The driving experience is excellent  I opted for the 5 speed manual transmission in my ZX3 although an 4 speed auto is optional  The ride is exceptionally smooth for a small car due to its 4 wheel independent suspension  Even when cruising in the highway at 70 mph the wind and road noise is minimal  Inside the car the controls are nicely layed out and within perfect reach  Headroom in the car is abundant even for someone over 6  tall  The seats provide great support and room  even with 5 adults in the car  The rear hatch provides enough room for storage  but with the split rear seats folded down the is a whoping 18 5 cubic feet of space  That s enormous for a hatchback  The only thing that Ford could do to improve the car is have a more powerful engine offered  Perhaps a 2 5 liter  The 2002 SVT model will remedy this but is going to carry a more expensive price tag at  18 500  
Pos, We wanted a new car  We needed a new car  We wanted a new wagon  our 92 Taurus wagon was a loyal dog but a dog with fleas  It stunk like it was on its last leg We shopped  did internet research and the all important test drives and came up with the  Ford Focus Wagon  And what a deal   plus we got Ford Credit s 0  Financing deal  We pay no interest over 5 years   pretty good deal Here s the review  b Look    It looks great  If it didn t have the blue Ford oval on the front and rear  you wouldn t know it was a domestic let alone a Ford  The inside is a masterpiece  Great curves  great lines b Comfort    Unlike the old Escort models  even the ZX2  you don t feel like you are sitting on the pavement while in the car  What great seats   like sitting in your living room  I don t get numb butt when driving for over an hour like from other cars  Driver s seat has adjustable height as well  I like mine the whole way up b Function    Everything is right in front of you  If you ever claim you hit that car or ran that light because you were fooling with the radio or AC  the claims adjuster will know you are lying   because you re driving a Focus  Cup holders on the floor in the middle are great  Standard AC and CD player are cool  AC blows cool and powerful  Heat comes up quickly for those brisk winter days b Handling    Rounding curves or making 90 degree turns couldn t be more comfortable  What carmakers called European handling in the 80 s is here in this domestic car  The SE Wagon comes standard with the nice Zetec engine and has great pick up  What s more  the car doesn t rattle or feel like it s going to fall apart when doing 70 mph on the highway  You ll be speeding along at 75 and feel like you re going 35  Trust me on this point   it s incredible b Room    Ford says it has more room in the inside than any other car in its class  I haven t really investigated this  but I am a believer anyways  Two kids in car seats in the back haven t complained yet  and they used to be traveling in the Taurus wagon with that huge bench seat  Plenty of leg room up front  too b Gas    The sticker says it should get 25 mpg in the city and 34 on the highway  My guess is that s about right  with moderate driving work  supermarket  etc  we go thru a fillup once a week b Little things    The rear trunk pops up with the push of a button from the inside panel  Automatic windows and locks respond very nicely  It has stiff handling  which is a surprise from a Ford  You can haul a lot of stuff in this Wagon   we haven t suffered by moving down a class to midsize from the Taurus wagon  Inside dome lights have that fade out thing when you get out and shut the doors   nice  A nice security measure is this   when using the remote clicker  only driver side door opens with one push of the unlock button  The other doors unlock with two pushes of the unlock button  This is a nice comfort for those late nights in a strange parking lot b What it could use    It could use lit vanity mirrors for the driver and passenger  Ford put a lot of neat things in this car and this should ve been one of them  Also  there should be dome or reading lights available to the backseat passengers   my kids miss theirs from the Taurus wagon  It could also use those magazine pocket things on the back of the front seats so the kids can put their books and things in them   they miss them too b Finally    Buy it  you ll like it We got ours in White with the Tan interior   looks very sharp  We had mudguards put on as well  It really turns heads and people can t believe it s a Ford and when you test drive it  neither will you  
Pos, The Ford Focus caught my eye  but not my pocketbook for over a year  I believed that they were little boxes and felt as if I would be better off buying something different  Boy was I wrong  I have a 2000 Toyota ECHO and have recently purchased a 2001 Focus  The focus seems much more stable  has better pick up and hopefully will not be as much trouble as the Echo has been  The interior is very comfortable and the air conditioner is very cold  Even sitting in the back seat  between two car seats  I stayed very cool  We own a hatchback  The  trunk space  is not overly large  but it is adequate  I just wouldn t take it on a long trip with all the kid s stuff  The gas mileage is great  Average mileage is 35 per gallon  I would suggest this car to anyone looking for a new vehicle  
Pos, I own a 1993 Ford Thunderbird LX Automatic V 6  It has been the most reliable car I have ever owned  more reliable than any of several foreign cars  including a Saab  The car now has 186 000 miles on it  and I have replaced only one major part  the head gasket  That was a costly  1000  repair  but a faulty head gasket can be manufactured by any company  it s just bad luck  Aside from that  all other engine and drive train parts are original and functioning well One drawback is that the doors are long and heavy  and  therefore  difficult for small people to manage  Their own weight caused them to sag  and I had to have them repaired  but it was not terribly expensive  There have been about three call backs  but none of them were of concern to me  and I have not had the work done What sold me on the car was the test drive  The car holds corners extremely well  and the highway ride is that of a big luxury car  The visibility is good in all directions  I have had no trouble on wet roads  and the snow handling has been satisfactory I paid about  15 500 for the car in 1993  so the cost of about  2200 per year  or 8 cents a mile  has been very reasonable All in all  I would recommend this as a good used car  if it has been well maintained  The model is out of production now  Ford is planning to reintroduce the Thunderbird as a sports car br br  
Pos, OK I have owned pickup trucks  and I have owned a pure  SUV  and for me  each is a compromise  In considering this purchase  I had to struggle with the question is a vehicle that has BOTH attributes nothing but a compromise at best My 1996 Nissan Pathfinder was handy  It had adequate room for hauling stuff  like groceries but not practical for hauling  dirty  stuff like building materials or plants  The back seats were not particularly comfortable either  It was a bit anemic in the power category but OK  I missed my pickup  but I need a vehicle that has a real back seat and in a way  the Pathfinder was a compromise that I could live with Still  I occasionally hauled things in the Nissan like bags of cement and bulky things from  Home Depot  that should never have been attempted with what is essentially a station wagon  I looked at  King Cab  pickups but saw them as just pickups with wasted space for junk behind the driver s seat  The idea of putting a human being in some of those  jump seats  they put in those things is laughable even for children Then came the first few  four door  pickups  Owning a Nissan  I stopped by and looked at a Nissan truck with four  real  doors  I attempted to sit in the back seat of one  and found that for me  the only way I could get in was to physically crawl in on all fours  and then sit sideways  It is hardly a practical vehicle  for me  unless you only expect to put children in the back seats Finally  last year I saw the Ford SuperCrew  and said to myself There is a truck car or was it a car truck I like  Essentially it seems like an Expedition with a 5 foot truck bed instead of the space for a third row of seats  In fact  the rear seat room in the SuperCab is only 2 inches smaller than the Expedition I drove the SuperCrew and that s all it took  I purchased the  Lariat  upgraded package because I like leather seats  and the paint trim was good looking  It came with the 5 4 engine  which was listed at  800 extra on the base model  I drive primarily in an urban area  and own a boat  that this truck pulls without effort  I expected horrible fuel mileage  but so far  I am surprised to find that in city driving  it is virtually identical in gas consumption to the Pathfinder I traded in  I realize that if loaded down  this will change drastically  however the good thing is at least with this truck  I have the option of  loading it down  While it is absolutely true that this truck is not a panacea for EVERYONE so far  it really is for me  I can put five adults COMFORTABLEY in it  I can pull a boat or trailer effortlessly  I can haul ten bags of cement or dog food  or throw my golf clubs in the back and not worry about snagging the upholstery of an SUV  I can use the bed extender and haul larger items  and I can pick up my family at the airport and not worry about my wife s  self esteem  being bruised by riding in a  pickup  The sticker price on this wonderful vehicle was actually  2 000 less than my venerable  96 Nissan Pathfinder  and while it doesn t have 4 wheel drive   that I hardly ever used with the Nissan  it does have EVERYTHING else  including almost twice the horsepower and the same gas consumption and MORE  The fit and finish for this  American made  vehicle is quite good  The Ride is excellent  The driving handling quality is excellent and for the features  the price is good too  The icing on the cake was Ford sponsored 3 9  financing PLUS a  500 rebate  One negative  I have to  back  it into my garage to close the door  as it is almost two feet longer than an Expedition  Oh well life has it s compromises  
Pos, I bought this truck new in 1988 and it s still going strong today  I expect to get at least 15 years use out of this truck with relatively minor repairs and if I get that then I will be pushing it to get 20 years The truck has been used very heavily   pulling four horse trailer  loaded about 11 000  pounds  on a Class IV hitch weekly for about 5 years  Also about 200 bales of hay a month and 2 tons of grain  It has been run back and forth from Halifax to Toronto  sometimes with horses  sometimes without since 1989 and has never yet failed me on the road  The most common repair on it  outside of body repairs and regular wear out and maintenance  has been U joints   and since I have sold my trailer  I am now getting about five years on the U joints instead of 12 18 months  The trailer pulling seems to affect the wear on the u joints  Most parts that have been replaced on the truck have been due failure dut to rust  not wear out or failed parts Electrical can be a big problem on these trucks   the big gang connector on the wiring harness caused about three months worth of grief in 1995   the plug was cut out and all the wires were hard wired together  siliconed and there have been no problems since Body has been a problem with the truck   perforation and paint  Ford re painted the truck at their expense   a recall  The dealer was supposed to take the truck down to bare metal and re prime and paint it  As well all rust was to be repaired  The dealer did a really poor job   in fact I think Ford paid for a lot of work that the dealer billed them for but didn t do  which has been my experience with our local Ford dealers in the Halifax Dartmouth area of Nova Scotia  Only one repair held up more than twenty four months and that was a panel that they had to cut out and a new one welded in We ve worked this truck real hard  It has over 300 000 km on it  I continue to drive it almost daily about 75 100 km per day for work  Gas consumption is still about 18 mpg  CDN  on the highway  same as the day it was new  and less in the city  Fuel economy is a little less than the GM and Dodge trucks are getting but the repairs according to friends with these trucks are fewer  Fuel economy pulling a trailer is AWFUL with this 5 0 litre eight cylinder  you need the diesel for any kind of economy  but  it s totally reliable and never breaks down and hauls loads that are twice what the truck is rated for  A friend and I do the exactly same thing with our trucks   my Ford and her GM   and the Ford wins out hands down every time   and it takes about a fifty percent heavier payload than her GM will It s a typical truck   lousy in the snow and on icy roads   you need about 500 lbs of ballast over the back axle on bad roads  The four wheel drive version might keep on going through the snow and icy roads but wait until you try to stop the 4 wheel drive truck once you get them going It hauls a real heavy load   we installed a set of Timbren hollow rubber springs  tow truck kit  and are still running on the original springs if you can believe it   no re arching and no broken leaves  I have been hauling up to one tonne in the box  grain  with no problems by using these Timbren hollow rubber springs  Looks and handles like there is no load in the truck These trucks are not for city people   even though they are really comfortable for city and long distance driving  They re a  quot amp  to park in the city parking lots and on the streets  they re hard on gas in the city and if you have the full size box  and what s the point on getting anything but  and extended cab they just don t fit in the garage of most city homes   coming in at about twenty feet long But they re just great for us country folk and while I will never buy another Ford car  I definitely will buy another Ford truck  I m real happy with this one  It has cost us a lot less on repairs than anything we have owned in years  It s consistent  It s fixable  Ford s service manuals are very good which helps  If you buy a used one and it s rust proofed  you should get years more on it  Even if it s not rust proofed  at least it is entirely fixable   right down to the frame  I had frame repairs done last year  perforation right through the rail  Ford body parts are becoming a problem to obtain but after market parts are still readily available  I probably won t buy another new one  can t come up with this kind of cash again for a vehicle  but it will be somebody s well used truck br br  
Pos, I can t believe out test drive of the new 2001 Ford Super Crew F 150  It has the size and power of a full size work horse but one look inside will convince you   this is No ordinary truck  The stylish features include a two tone dash  extra plush seating  fashionable grab bars  well appointed easy to read dash  steering wheel controls  matching head rests  a handy center console plus drink containers and pockets in the door panels for extra storage  Also the roomy back seat could easily seat three adults and the back seats fold 40 60 to allow for lots of extra storage The ride was smooth as glass and plenty of pep for the highway  It was easy to handle in traffic and visibility was excellent as well  My husband  a GMC man  is built like a bear and he had too agree this truck has a lot to offer  The towing package also comes with a larger radiator for more efficient cooling while towing  The exterior color I really was drawn to was the new Island Blue  The bed is 5 5 quot  but there is an optional bar extension that will give you 7  of hauling space for  195 00  Great appeal for both the luxury details for the ladies and brute strength for the guys  Plus room for teenagers in the back seats   I recommend it for a terrific family vehicle     
Pos, I bought my Ford F150 Lariet Supercrew 4x4 about a month ago  I haven t found anything that I don t like about it  I love the way it handles much better that the explorer that I traded in  The interior is wonderful  the leather is very durable  I can seat 6 people  the backseat is very roomy even with three kids in it  The bed extender is handy  I ve hauled a full size mattress and box springs  and the power is awesome  If you can get one with a moon roof  do it  It is a fun option  We are a family of 5 and totally enjoy this truck  The gas mileage is better than I thought it would be  My truck is black and requires lots of baths  but there is nothing that compares with a shiny new black truck  
Pos, We purchased our 2001 F 150 SuperCrew on April 15th 2000 as soon as they hit the market  I could not ask for a better truck  Has all the space of a car with towing and hauling of a truck  The V 8 engine is more than able to pull my 14 ft cargo trailor  A great looking truck  I will purchase another one as soon as my time is up with this one  Ford has hit the jackpot with this one in my book  If you like big vehicles and the ride of a car buy this truck  My truck has a AM FM CD Player with surround sound  automatic with cruise  power windows and door locks  I did not purchase the extended gate that is a option on this vehicle  You have plenty of room through out the truck br br  
Pos, We purchased our SuperCrew in Feb  2001  Ours is a 4x4 Lariat  5 4 liter  with navy blue on tan leather interior  We ve owned 2 Ford trucks prior to this one  so we were quite familiar with them  My husband is a general contractor and realtor  so hauling equipment and or building supplies as well as people were both equally important  I think we ve found the best of both worlds with this truck  This truck rides well  in fact  it s the one we choose to drive long distances  We have 3 children  and the interior is roomy enough to please  The dual media is a nice option  and the factory radio sound quality is great Here are some problems we ve encountered with this truck  1  As previously stated  this is our 3rd Ford truck  On all 3  we ve always had to have the up down window button on the passenger side only  replaced  For some reason  they re always defunct  Do something about this  Ford   covered by warranty  2  The cassette player won t release my tape  We thought maybe the tape was defective  but it turns out the CD player won t work either  Our Ford dealer has ordered us another radio which is covered by warranty  3  The fuel pump had to be replaced  This also was covered by warranty This truck is pretty fast too  You don t have to fret about changing lanes on the highway in this  I m 5ft 4in  and have no trouble whatsoever driving this truck  In fact  I prefer driving it to my 2000 BMW  There are no blind spots  and it handles well  plus there s no need to cringe when you hit a pothole  
Pos, My wife purchased this car new in 1995  She wanted a laser red 5 speed GT  and we were able to find one at a local Ford dealer  We drove both an SE and a GT for comparison  The GT is a totally different car  Fast and sprung stiffly  it is a real sports car  Our car is not loaded  no sunroof or leather  but has air  cruise  CD player  power locks  remote keyless entry  and a few other goodies Once we had the car  we did run into several problems  all of which were minor  A leaky radiator cap  pealing paint on the hood  broken seat air pump for the bolster   I think maybe a few others I forgot about  All were corrected under warrenty  I worried about the paint the most  but they seemed to be able to fix this and it has not been a problem  We have replaced a battery  spark plug wires and tires  The Goodyear Eagles were done at about 35 000 miles  We replaced them with Parnelli Jones all seasons which work very well I now drive this car daily  and it is simply a joy to drive  It has about 50 000 miles and has been pretty much trouble free the last few years  It handles superbly   so much so I wish it had 20 or 30 more horsepower  The steering has great feel  This car is on a rail  The stick shift is fantastic  with quick shifts and smooth operation  I am 6 3 quot  so I do have to squeeze myself into this car  but I can get comfortable   no one can sit behind me though  The car has a large trunk and the seats fold down to offer tons of space for hauling larger items  Finally   what a sweet looking car  Wish I had something this cool back in high school  On the down side  the rear seats are not usuable for kids if you are tall like me  I have a car seat on the passanger side and have to move the passanger front seat up quite a bit in order for the seat to fit  No way we can get a 2nd child behind me  so this car s days are numbered  The ride is quite stiff  I mean STIFF  Everyone that rides in this car comments on it  You do adjust driving it daily  but it is just not very comfortable for any long trips  The paint seems to be of a lower quality than most cars  In spite of regular washing and waxing  this car is showing a few flaws  Nothing terrible  but I worry about it  Lastly  the V 6 is starting to burn a small amount of oil   about a quart every 3 000 miles  It still runs perfect   22 mpg in the city and 26 mpg on the highway I plan to trade or sell this car soon  and re sale looks pretty bad  Oh well  it was fun while we had it  This is a great car for a single guy or girl   or a couple with no kids  Or a teenager that wants to make it into a SCCA solo racer  This is not a family car   but that is part of the fun br br  
Pos, I ve owned my 95 Probe for almost 5 years now  and what a cheap 5 years it has been  This car has not given me a single problem  They get great gas mileage  meaning around 25 to 27 mpg  so don t worry about having to fill it up every other 3 or 4 days cause these cars will go for weeks  It s a sporty little car  so it s very fun to drive  too  The main thing you have to consider  though  when buying a 95 Probe is the mileage  Little cars with little engines like these could last anywhere from 90 000 to 200 000 miles  You would definitely want to have the engine checked out before buying it to make sure that s its got a lot of life left in it  The only thing I would say would be an inconvenience with this car is that when something does break  it s not fun to fix it  Once  I broke my key off in the ignition  don t ask how  and we had to put a whole new ignition in because it was one solid piece  rather than broken down into smaller parts that are easier to replace  Ford has a funny way of doing things sometimes  but aside from that  they put together a VERY solid and fun vehicle when they made the Probes  I don t know why they stopped making them  but they re great cars and definitely worth every penny  
Pos, When we first had a baby  I was driving an Eclipse Spyder  Needless to say  this is not a baby car  As a matter of fact  I refuse to put my son in it  For a year  we managed to get by with one car that we could take our son around in  But  being an independent women  grin  I wanted to be able to leave the house when I was home alone with my son  which I couldn t do at this point  Why didn t I just keep the  baby  car  Well  mine was foreign  and my husband works at Ford you do the math  So  we needed a new car  I refused to be a minivan mom  no offense to those of you who are  I just don t like em  so we decided on an SUV  Being that my husband worked at Ford  he heard about the Escape long before it came out  And I wanted one  It was an Explorer  but smaller and cuter  That s a good combination considering I m small  and  well  cute   grin  But seriously  I liked the idea that it was an SUV that drove like a car  It was also supposed to be much safer  without the threat of rollovers that most SUV s are plagued with  So  we ordered one and after months of waiting  it came in  And it s beautiful  We got toreador red  which is a maroonish color  The interior is tan and black  The car is also available in yellow  yes  bright yellow  for you showoffs  red  a forest green  blue  black  white  and tan  I don t know the specific  Ford  names for all these colors  but that s what it breaks down to  Aside from the pleasing asthetic value of the Escape  it also drives great  If you are looking for a good off road vehicle  this is not the one you should be buying  But  the Escape wasn t made for offroaders  It was made for people who wanted the look of an SUV  with the control of a car  It s a little bumpier than a regular car  but the ride is smooth  It also corners very well  which I love  being used to a small convertible  The Escape is available in 2 Wheel Drive  or 4 Wheel Drive  We chose the 4WD variety  You can also get a four cylinder or six cylinder engine  Ours is six  According to the dealer  the four cylinder engines aren t selling as well  The Escape has some great standard features  Solar tint glass  Woo  How new millenium  power everything  roof rack  rear windshield wipers   flip and fold  rear seats  A C  anti lock brakes  and remote keyless entry  We also got side step bars  a power moonroof  and side airbags  Oh yea  did I mention that the CD player is standard  Nice  eh  All this  and a great price too  The base model runs around  18 000  Fully loaded  which ours is  is around  25 200  Not bad for an SUV  Gas mileage is a little better than standard SUV  City is 18 MPG and highway is 24 MPG  It s no car mileage  but still not bad  For all you mommies and daddies out there  the Escape also comes with three tether hookups for the backseats  This is a great feature to help keep your child s car seat secure  And our car seat fit very well  The backseats are relatively comfortable  and there is tons of legroom  Although it looks smaller than an Explorer  the didn t skimp on space  The rear area leaves plenty of room for numerous parcels or luggage  There is also a cover you can place over them to protect anything from flying french fries  Being a short person  I can t accurately judge the legroom in the driver s seat  but my husband  who is much taller than I am  had no problem fitting in the passenger seat  The car is very comfortable to drive  and I feel very safe with my child in the back  Ford has added a number of safety features to the Escape  making it a nice  reliable ride  It looks nice  drives well  and is priced affordably  For those parents out their looking for a good family vehicle  I highly recommend the Ford Escape  One warning  They are selling like hotcakes  so get one while you can  I believe there is quite a waiting list for orders  so if you are interested  call your dealer right away  
Pos, I had the opportunity to test drive the 2001 Escape after salivating over all the press clippings and related media hype for about 6 months  Because I couldn t contain my excitement  I went to my local Mazda dealership and drove the Escape s sister SUV  Mazda Tribute  base model 4x4  V6  almost a month before the Escape made its bow in early September  The drive was a little less than acceptable  especially frustrating when I schooled the salesman on every single aspect of the SUV  but I wanted the Escape  Passing by the Ford dealership late on a Sunday evening  there she was Quick background  I own a 2000 Nissan Xterra  V6  4x4  loaded  and I love and loathe it  Extremely comfortable and quiet ride  nice stock stereo and accessories  The engine is horribly inefficient and lacks power  Thus  the need to try the Escape on for size Getting into the Escape would be no problem for all but the tallest members of America  My two kids easily climbed in and found the seat belts   If you are trying to save a little money  think about passing on the side step bars  They cannot hold much weight  and since the Escape is about 4 6 inches shorter than other full sized SUV s  there is a good chance you won t ever use them  One advance warning that the insulation wasn t going to be as good as other SUV s was the  quot thump quot  of the doors  Instead of closing with a warm  quot thump quot  the doors sounded like something off of a less expensive model  Once in  I found the 6 way seat a nice feature  along with the no frills dashboard and controls for the fans and sunroof  The stereo was a bit too complicated  but sounds much better than the upgraded stereo in the sister Mazda Tribute  Leather seats are stiff  but I am sure they would soften a little after a while  The model also had privacy glass  which I recommend  I had a chance to compare some of the interior dimensions for the Escape  and the numbers really shocked me  The Escape is as wide as an Explorer  only 17 inches shorter than an Xterra  had more leg room than the Xterra  There are some other interior dimensions for the Escape that are as big  if not bigger  than some of the bigger  thirstier and more expensive SUV s  Some over  10K more  I was anxious to feel the 200 HP V6 matched to this yellow  baby SUV bullet  and it passes every test I put it through  Passing and accelerating are excellent  even up hills and with four average sized passengers  It tends to downshift a little quicker than I expected when pressed  but a small tradeoff for an engine that bests any other SUV with that kind of power weight by at least 5 7 mpg  Another trade off is the road noise  I found it was more pronounced than I would have liked  and I was raising my voice to talk to the other passengers  A little more padding and insulation in the doors would do well for the noise   Hint  hint  Ford  I was able to have the experience of the night driving dash and gauge lights  and I wasn t impressed  During the daylight  the dash gauges are very impressive  The night time greenish red hue would take a little getting used to  Handling is wonderful for the Escape  Cornering is just like a car  The Escape is confident in all phases of a town or country drive  Quick note  I have read some of the other excellent reviews of the Escape  and air conditioning was mentioned as a problem area  I live in the North West  Seattle  WA  so we rust instead of bake  I did not test the AC  but the fan seemed to work as it should If you have passed on the Xterra  Montero Sport and CRV for lack of power  Jeep Cherokee for persistent mechanical problems and the Rav 4 for the looks power problems  the 2001 Ford Escape is an excellent choice  I also suspect that it will keep its resale value very well  Keep in mind the 2003 gas electric Escape that is said to get over 35 mpg and still has the same amount of horsepower  For those who just want to get into this SUV and don t have the  23 25K it will take to adequately equip the 4x4 V6 model  seriously consider the 4x2  5 speed  Even with a little bit of equipment  you can have a respectable SUV for under  20K br br  
Pos, My wife and I recently traded in my 96 Dodge Dakota P U with 96K miles on it for this wonderful Ford Escape  After making a list of about 13 cars we thought we d like  we went on line and researched them all  After weeding out those   can t afford  cars  I spoke to my brother  a car expert  on his opinion  Being that I own a motorcycle and haul it he suggested the Escape  We went to our local dealer and test drove one and fell in love immediately  It just so happens they had the exact color with everything we wanted in stock  We ended up with the XLT  3 0L V6 Automatic  with all the buzzers  bells  and extras that is possible  excluding leather power seats  We have had it for a month now and we are finding that it is receiving exactly what they said we would in gas mileage  20 23  everytime  The first tank only got 17  but everyone after that has been at least 20 MPG  and we live in the DC Metro area where we drive EVERYWHERE I would definetely recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable SUV with style  
Pos, The Escape is not a classic SUV  it has unibody construction instead of the  classic  SUV s  body on frame  truck like design Ford Escape and Mazda Tribute are brothers  Both cars were developed jointly by Ford and Mazda  part of Mazda belongs to Ford   I think something like 35 b ENGINES  The base front dive Escape uses the Focus s 4 cylinder 2 0 L 120 hp Zetec engine  the optional V 6 Duratec 3 0 L engine  that Ford also uses in Taurus  has 200 horsepower and 200 pound feet of torque  According to  Car and Driver  magazine  the V 6 version  Escape XLT  runs quarter mile for 16 8 seconds at 83 mph V 6 equipped Escape goes from zero to 60 mph in 8 8 seconds  and gets 24 mpg on the highway b TRANSMISSIONS  The manual transmission equipped model has a floor shifter  but the automatic transmission  CD4E four speed  has a column shifter  b i I hate column shifters i b  You cannot get the manual transmission with V 6  Not cool b SIZE  The size is about Honda CR V but the Escape feels larger than a Honda  With the rear seats up  there is 33 cubic feet of storage space  with the seats folded down   63 cubic feet b WHEELS  There are two types of wheels available   15  and 16  The V 6 Escape XLT uses P235 70TR 16 Firestone Wilderness HT tires  The spare tire is 17  temporary one The tires are a little bit too noisy over the rough pavement b SUSPENSION  Escape uses independent suspension  which offers good ride quality  The brakes are equipped with ABS  front disc  rear drum  The stopping distance from 70 mph is 171 feet   better than  any  other SUV  FYI  It takes Nissan Xterra 199 feet   OFF ROAD  Escape XLT weights about 3550 pound Escape  I read that Escape s off road capabilities are challenged  comparing to the real SUVs  However  with available four wheel drive  they are much better than any sedan s  Escape uses the Control Trac II all wheel drive system  which allows the Escape to run in front wheel drive until the system senses the wheel slippage  Then it sends up to  100 b  of the engine s torque to the rear wheels until the slippage stops  Escape has a  4x4 On  switch that does not engage the four wheel drive permanently  but engages the rear drive more quickly  which is better for severe conditions   PRICING  The base front drive Escape XLS  with the 4  cylinder 2 0 L Zetec engine and a five speed manual transmission  starts at  18 160  At this price the car has air conditioning  an AM FM stereo with a CD player  remote keyless entry  a tilting steering wheel  and power locks  windows  and mirrors The  upscale  Escape XLT has ABS  aluminum wheels  cruise control  and fog lamps  It costs  19 710  Nice price  don t you think b OPTIONS  The 3 0 L V 6 Duratec adds  1400 to the XLS and  1480 to the XLT and Control Trac all wheel drive system adds  1625 The XLT model with the V 6 and all wheel drive automatically gets the  350 Class II trailer towing package  which ups towing capacity from 2000 pounds to 3500 Also available are leather trim  a power glass sunroof  and front side airbags  MACH audio system that replaces the in dash CD player with in dash six disc changer The Escape is located between classic large SUVs and midsize cars  It uses carlike unibody construction and independent suspension  available 4 wheel drive is  civilaized   I hope  if you want an SUV  you will get Escape  It handles well  has excellent brakes and lots of cabin space  And the fuel economy is very good i  
Pos, The Escape is Ford s entry in the popular mini SUV class of automobiles  It competes with the Nissan Xterra  Honda CRV  Toyota RAV4 and a few other SUVs  I think Ford has a good thing on its hands and  with a few minor changes  the Escape could be a category leader Exterior  the Escape is the best looking car in its class  It doesn t try to be too adventurous or too athletic  like the XTerra with its spoilers and front grills  and yet doesn t look to docile  like the CRV  Not surprisingly  the Escape looks a lot like an Explorer  albeit one with updated and refreshed lines  One element that can be improved on the exterior of the Escape is the side view mirrors  which shake at highway speeds due to the wind and don t provide a good view of other cars Interior  the interior of the Escape is generally well thought out  The radio and climate control controls are easy to use and located high up on the middle console  The column mounted gear shifter  however  was placed in an awkward position  It does not shift very well and it obscures a portion of the radio  A better solution would be to place the shifter in between the front passengers like most other SUVs  The materials used in the interior could also be improved  The dashboard and doors use cheap looking plastic and the seats are covered by a rough fabric Driving  the Escape s strongest selling point is its drivability  The Escape simply drives as well as any good car  which means that it drives better than most SUVs  The Escape s steering is very linear and direct and the SUV benefits from having a short wheelbase  I was able to maneuver the Escape in busy Seattle highway traffic with ease  The large windows and upright seating position also allows for good visibility  The V6 engine  with 201 hp  provides a lot of power and torque for a car of this size and I was able to accelerate easily in all situations  The main detraction from the driving experience relates to the immense amount of noise that emanates from the road and the engine  The car is so loud on some roads that I had to turn the radio up  Ford should consider fitting the Escape with different tires and more sound deadening material for a quieter ride Overall  the Escape is a reasonably priced small SUV that drives more like a car than a truck and seems built from one solid piece  If Ford improves the quality of the interior  including a redesign of the shifter  and makes the Escape quieter  this SUV will set sales records  
Pos, I have just purchased a RHD Ford Maverick known as the Ford Escape in the U S I need a vehicle that was capable enough to tow my caravan   trailor plus it had to be car like to drive and not like many of the European SUV s i e  Freelander   Discovery which give a choppy ride and certainly do not have all the extra s thrown in as standard  I test drove a 3 0 litre Auto which i thought was great but here in the u k  petrol at about  6 0 a gallon makes this affordable only if money is no object  The only other option was the 2 0 litre Manual which i opted for and ordered before test driving as the dealer did not have one available  I have had the car 3 weeks now and it is GREAT   in everyway  Easy to handle   Park and reverse  Excellant driving position   Loads of room   Plenty of storage and cup holders which are not common here in the U K  but which i think are a must  It tows fine   feels stable although the 2 0 litre engine has to work at it  This is the first vehicle of this type i have owned and i don t think i could go back to a normal saloon which i had before  Overall Great car and as i headed this up A BREATH OF FRESH AIR for us normally stuffy Brits  
Pos, My wife and I were in the market for a SUV and test driving the mini SUVs  Honda CRV  Hyundai Sante Fe  Subaru Forester to name a few of the vehicles we tested  After the first mile driving the 2001 Escape XLT my wife s mind was made up  She was impressed with the visibility  power  and interior room  She was giving up her  95 Mitsubishi Diamante for a 4 wheel drive vehicle  The ride was a little stiffer but not as bad as we expected  The front seats took some time getting used to  but after a few trips we realized that they offer good support and back fatigue after 2 3 hours of driving has not been a factor We purchased our Escape in Oct  2000 and have had one recall notice that did not apply to our vehicle  We ve been averaging 16 17 miles per gallon around town and 20 21 mpg on the highway  It has been through several snow storms this winter here in CT and has performed admirably  It feels very stable at both highway speed and in bad weather  I m sure the 4 wheel independent suspension has a lot to do with this  The automatic 4 wheel drive works amazingly well  One has to try hard to get a wheel to spin on wet as well as snowy roads  The most important factor in our decision to buy this vehicle was that my wife felt completely safe driving it  After a snowy winter she still feels the same We were hoping for a little better gas mileage  but for an SUV I guess the mileage we re getting isn t all that bad  
Pos, Bottom Line  I have had my Escape for six months and love it The Great  A lot of car for the price  roomy interior  decent gas mileage  people crane their necks on the road to check it out The Not So Great  Lots of wind noise on the highway  probably not ideal for true off roading may cause accidents from other drivers admiring it I first purchased my Ford Escape last October when I was staring straight into the beginning of another harsh winter and a daily  two hour round trip commute  I needed a vehicle with four wheel drive and did not want to have to resort to selling off body parts to pay for gas  Here s some specifics The look  I purchased a light parchment gold Escape with the leather interior  The truck looks great inside and out  People are always admiring it  asking about it  and I definitely recommend going with leather if you can afford it  It is comfortable  sharp  and will help hold up the resale value The ride  The car rides very smoothly  However  when you jump on the highway  be prepared to turn the radio up and or talk very loudly with your passengers  The wind noise is pretty bad  This is about the only negative thing I have to say about the car  Bells and Whistles  While I have a more Spartan model  you can  trick out  your Escape with moonroof and deluxe sound system  including a six CD changer  I have the standard  single CD system and am very happy with it  Shifting into four wheel drive is a snap  and the cruise and wiper controls are of the standard  simple to use variety  The gear shifter is somewhat awkwardly placed and gets in the way of the radio  I have the V6 model and the fuel economy is decent while still providing plenty of giddyup  You can also get a four cylinder model for increased fuel efficiency  but I have my doubts as to whether that will lend enough power to adequately drive the car For serious off roaders  this probably is not your best option  The Escape rides lower than larger SUV s and I wouldn t trust it in a true off roading situation  
Pos, Granted  this is my first SUV so I didn t know what to expect  I did my homework with all the SUVs out there and knew I wanted a 4X4 automatic with a few nice things in it and a few of the standard things I did a lot of comparisons of different SUVs  using Consumer Reports Car Service  and I always found that the ESCAPE was at the top of the list Needless to say they were scarce to say the least I was online everyday looking for one  I struck gold one on a Tuesday made the deal on Saturday I have a soup to nuts XLT with the only thing missing being the side air bags The first and probably the most impressive thing to grab and get your attention is the power this baby has  V6  you say to yourself over and over as you fly down the road  With that said and in spite of it s power it s handling is just as impressive  Turning on a dime with a SUV can you believe it yes you can  The fact that it takes runs on regular gas is simply a joy  Call me silly but with the power and performance of that power you would expect premium gas hands down  Inside is roomy  The rear seats are easy to maneuver once you get the hang The dash is easy to read and everything is at your fingertips  Plenty of storage  big and small Convenience  cargo cover and net are a nice touch  an additional 12v outlet in the rear Access to the rear can be done via opening the rear door or opening the glass window and reaching in I dislike the shifter on the steering column  It s very long even though I still find myself grabbing the windshield wiper instead  At night you can t see the shifter so when you reach for the radio cassette CD controls you can  as I have  hit the shifter which scares the living daylights out of you  I have since put a white wrap around it so I can t miss it Because of it s power and it s power and power  you do really move  Because of this you find yourself in the station often  I think it has a mind of it s own   on the highway mileage is great  On the streets it s chomping at the bit to go but you can t so it seems like it makes you pay for not putting it on the highway A simple thing but the rear window wiper is a bit of wimp It cleans only a small semi circle   you can see out it but for me I wanted more window cleaned  
Pos, In the beginning  When we bought or first SUV 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee it worked just fine for us  it was just us and our big yellow labrador  It gave us the right amount of room and comfort that we needed at that time Fast forward  Three kids later and we still have the lab In 2000 we leased our first Excursion  V10 Limited  This was driven daily by my wife to and from school with the kids  If it 146s acts like a bus  We used it like a bus  She is only 5 4 at best  and had no problem driving this truck  Not a nick on a bumper in two years  Bottom line  it did a great job hauling two strollers  three kids a dog and who ever else needed to go some where  Great for Vacations too  The long rides to Florida down the dreaded route 95 corridor  All kids learn to hate this ride  We could actually fit all the stuff for vacation without the roof carrier  By the way  really kills gas mileage too  So  another environmentally friendly plus for the big truck  It was actually a pleasure to have enough room to be comfortable all the way down without killing each other  And the fact that it does have a 44 gallon gas tank is a god send on very long trips  Especially when going through states that don 146t have stations every two miles or when driving through the night when most stations are closed Inside  The interior is comfortable enough without being one of those sissy SUV 146s  All I was missing was my remote and I would have been right at home  The sound system is fantastic and the kids love the fact that the windows went all the way down  Even with Baby seats all have enough room to spread out  A full size cooler fits in the center just behind the front seats making the outer seats usable for passengers  And you still have room for 3 more in the third row Access is better then the GM trucks  The tri door makes access to the rear cargo area simple  The fact that you do not loose the rear wiper as you would on the GM Barn door style is a plus  When all seats are removed you can fit 25 pieces of sheet rock laying down  or one queen size futon in tact Towing  Don 146t kid yourself this puppy has neck wrenching torque  I 146m not sure what the other reviews perception was based upon because  I also own a Shelby if this is any indication of knowing torque  Look at the towing ratings and you decide  I 146ve had well over 8000 pounds on the back and boy did it drive like nothing was behind me  Enough said about that  This is a great towing truck Ride  The long wheel base gives the Excursion the ride of a Limo   A 4x4 Limo  Because of the length it floats down the road  We definitely notice a better ride in the 2003 then the original 2000  The shocks are not as harsh and it does not bounce around as much as the 2000 did Bad Roads    And not to mention bad roads  The roads in the State of New Jersey kills more cars then bad drivers  Statistically this may not be true  but have you ever hit a large pot hole followed by a series of whoop de doos  Not something you want to attempt in a non SUV  I 146ve seen these roads tear off wheels  Again creating large traffic jams during rush hour  Another mass waste of fossil fuel and commuters time   ok that was another stretch  but you get the point City Roads  New York City will kill a vehicle just as quickly as a off road Baja race  People say  147People who buy SUV 146s never take them off road 148 you do not have to take it off road to have the same experience  Try a romp around NYC and see how quick a lesser truck would crumble the torture of the urban roads  If you ever danced fender to fender with a Yellow Cab you certainly understand why in the city size does matter maintenance  After 24 months and 36 000 miles  Oil every 3 000 miles  tire rotation after every 12 000 miles and that is it  not a problem and never back for any warranty work Consolidation is being environmentally friendly  As far as being environmentally friendly  We live in the NY Tri State area and during one of the family outing to the Bronx Zoo we invited another family to come with us  We all fit in the Excursion  So what  you may say  Well  by car pooling we kept one additional vehicle off the already crowded roads and actually saved resources  It may be a stretch  but none the less  true The bad news  After the 2 year lease was up and we went back to the dealer  we had every intention of buying the truck back from Ford  Well  as luck would have it  the buy back was very high  and they wanted almost  30 000 to buy it back  Being that it was out of warranty at this point we decided that a nice shiny new 2002 Ford Windstar Limited was the way to go  It too had all the bells and whistles for family use  Video  auto sliding doors  remote start and the tow package  All the features a mom of three could want  Life in the Minivan  We did a few long road trips to Indiana and florida with the Windstar  it drove great  but buy were we a little tight  For the extra space that was needed  the roof carrier came out of mothballs again  Albeit the gas mileage was better in the mini van  but the need for space was greater Snow and Bad weather  Even with optional traction control it was not the best in the snow  Maybe we just got used to the Jeep and the Excursion 146s 4 wheel drive  The Excursion  3 feet of snow and no issues The move  A year and a half into the Windstar we decided that we really needed the larger vehicle  So  I waited for the 2004 Excursions to roll off the assembly line  This forced the dealers to clear out the 2003 stock  And for the first time it really did work in my favor  0  financing   4 000 off from Ford  Smack the dealer around a little more and they will drop another  2 000 off  This was great  We had our pick of styles  colors and options Sales may be down  but it sure did give me allot of vehicles to choose from We purchased a beautiful black 2003 Limited Excursion  It is smoother and quitter then the 2000  The fit and finish is much better then the original  The V10 was great in the first one  so we had no reservations about another V10  They are powerful enough to propel a 32 foot motor home  they can certainly handle the excursion  Although  I would have liked the 6 0 Diesel the  4 000 uplift was a bit much to handle  It really did blow the monthly payment out of the window The competition  We also looked at the Suburban and the Yukon XL  Best kept secret  we got allot more truck for allot less money  The Chevy and GMC were over 10k more and the incentives were not as good  The 1500 platform did not equal the class of the Excursion  for it to be apples to apples you would have to buy a 2500 series and load it up  The Ford by far was the better deal  And hey  147It 146s a FORD TRUCK 148 Enough of the Ford commercials  Bottom line  The Excursion might not be as environmentally friendly as my Honda Insight 70 MPG  But  that is my work vehicle that I drive over 25 000 miles per year  Just as the insight fits my needs during the week  the excursion fits my wife s needs If ford made a Hybrid Excursion that got 70 MPG I 146d buy it  But they don 146t  and the excursion suits our lifestyle today My thoughts  Great truck  Great Value  If you can 146t run with the big boys go to the back of the bus  Pun intended This is a great vehicle if you have children  alot of stuff  need to move and tow large and heavy things  Not right for everyone  but if you have any of the above needs this vehicle is for you People who don 146t have children and never owned an Excursion should not write about it  Very well written review  for a single person who drives a little toyota  Try 1000 pounds of cement in the back of your echo  Oh yea  that would take 33 3 trips  Who is being environmentally friendly now  Would love to see what you say about the Porsche 911 ps   a note from the wife  I am the primary driver of this truck and I love it  I just wanted to respond to the negative comments written    I am only 5 4 and I have never once had a visibility issue or a maneuverability issue  Which leads me to believe that the 6 146 tall guy who borrowed his bosses truck is a REALLY BAD DRIVER  And by the way  even in your best dream  the Odyssey doesn 146t come close to the interior space of an Excursion  In response to the couple making the penis jokes   guess what   I DON 146T HAVE A PENIS    because I am a mother of three  Maybe it is you who has the penis envy  And one last thing  the suv 146s that park too close or take up too much space have nothing to do with the truck  it has everything to do with the inconsiderate driver   which I am not If this makes no sense  read other reviews 
Pos, The Ford Ranger is sharp looking truck and provides a comfortable ride  I t has been great for getting back and forth to work and has been very reliable  However if you want to pass someone the four cylinder engine does not provide enough power to do it without downshifting  and I would always hesitate before trying to pass on an up hill slope  Overall the paint seems to be holding up very well as are the factory alloy wheels  Braking and handling provide no major complaints If you are looking to do heavy hauling this is not recommended though it should do fine with the 6 cylinder version  This is going to be a wonderful starter vehicle for my son when he turn sixteen next year  
Pos, Americans travelling in Europe for the first time often have a moment of culture shock when they hail a taxi and a Mercedes E class or BMW 5 series pulls up to the curb  In America  these cars have been icons of intelligence and success for more than a generation  In their homeland they are more likely to be diesel powered taxis designed for durability and low operating cost than ultimate driving machines bred for the autobahn In the late 80 s Ford tried to beat the Germans at their own game  In 1986 they had bet the company on the groundbreaking Taurus  If you weren t there  it is almost impossible to imagine the impact this car had on the American auto industry  Its styling was as cutting edge as any European sedan of the time and it had much more of a European feel than any American sedan made before  It couldn t compete against the European sedans sold here  But Ford wondered if the Germans could remake a taxi into a world class sport sedan  could they do it with a car that had won the hearts of conservative middle America That was the challenge that faced the Taurus SHO throughout its eleven year production run  It was by any objective standard a worthy competitor to the midsize entries from BMW and Mercedes  one with a distinctive American accent  But in the end not enough buyers could make the mental leap that this Taurus was different than the one their parents had traded in their Fairmont or Caprice Classic for b Overview and Driving Impressions b There were three generations of the SHO  The first  1989 1991  was the original  86  quot Jellybean quot  Taurus platform with the SHO V 6 and suspension component upgrades  The final version  1996 1999  used the all new  quot Oval quot  Taurus platform and carried an equally new V 8  But I don t recommend either  The first generation SHO was a great engine mated to a chassis that wasn t intended for it  while the third became so refined it lost much of the distinctive personality in the earlier versions  The sweet spot was the 1992 1995 second generation cars  In 1992 all Taurii were redesigned and the SHO received distinctive front and rear styling that gave it a crisper  stronger look than the first edition  Under the skin several weaknesses and customer complaints had been addressed  and the entire platform was strengthened  giving the SHO handling abilities that came closer to matching the Germans than any American sedan that came before  And in 1993 it finally got the automatic transmission the pundits said it needed to win over American buyers The heart of the SHO was its engine  Yamaha was originally hired to design a new cylinder head for the 3 0 liter Ford V 6  The head they came up with produced too much power for the Ford block to live with  so Ford contracted them to come up with an entire powerplant  Their answer was a dual overhead cam  24 valve V 6 that only shared a three liter displacement with the engine in lesser Taurus models  The engine was a marvel  With 220 horsepower available the SHO was the most powerful engine in its class by a slim marging  But it weighed 400 pounds less than the Merc and 500 pounds less than the BMW  This made the Taurus SHO the quickest car in its class More important than the numbers was how different the three cars felt in action  The Mercedes  from its engine to how the ashtray door closed with a solid but velvet smooth action  felt literally like a bank vault on wheels  The BMW reeked of refinement by drivers  extremely capable yet never feeling like it would lose its composure  Both were outstanding cars with clear personalities  But neither  in my book  compared to the shot of tequila and a big slap on the back feeling of the SHO  When you got into the gas in the Ford the engine growled  the steering wheel tugged slightly in your hands  then the growl became a roar as the tachometer needle swung quickly towards 7 000 rpm  It wasn t crude  in capable hands the SHO was a remarkably composed car to drive at speed with little body roll and crisp responses  The SHO was simply spicier and more engaging than the Germans One of the big reasons to choose a second generation car over a first is the shifter mechanism for the five speed transaxle  First gen SHO s used a cable actuated shifter that had all the feel of stirring a pot of warm molasses  Starting in  92 all five speed SHO s ditched the spaghetti wires for solid linkage that greatly improved the feel  But it was still notably less precise than the action on the rear wheel drive BMW with its superb five speed  All front wheel drive cars share this handicap compared to a good rear wheel drive setup  Torque steer  another bane of powerful front wheel drive cars  could tug the wheel in your hands but you really had to be hamfisted with the throttle to have it effect your driving  As I mentioned earlier  in 1993 the SHO got the slushbox  automatic  the critics said the market wanted  The thinking was  as only a relative few BMW s came to America with manual gearboxes and Mercedes didn t offer them on any model in the E class  to compete the SHO needed an automatic even if the purists had a fit over it  The critics were half right  The automatic didn t make the SHO a bestseller but it did improve the feel of driving the car  This is just my personal preference  but in a midsized or larger sedan I prefer an automatic if it is done right  Hustling a small light sports car up a road and snapping through shifts is one of life s greater joys  but a 3 000 pound sedan is more enjoyable when the strategy is smoothness and forethought  And a good automatic is better partnered to this style of driving  In the SHO it was no contest in my book  The automatic was a better automatic than the manual was manual  Huh  While the manual was improved in  92  it still had an imprecision that hindered finding a gear instinctively  The automatic was better mated to the SHO  with crisp  smooth upshifts that matched the sporting personality of the car  and the effect of torque steer was greatly reduced compared to the manual  Unless you are the kind of enthusiast who can t have any sports car with an automatic  the auto is a better way to go If the Taurus was a bargain BMW  as reviewers and fans called it  it hid the trimmed corners well  I don t know how Ford made a dime on them  I prepped new cars and did trim NVH repairs at a large Ford dealer in 92 94 and quickly noticed that a loaded out Taurus LX was only a couple of thousand dollars less than a SHO  Fully equipped  with leather  excellent power sport seats  full power accessories  power glass moonroof  premium  JBL  sound  CD and the automatic the sticker came in at less than  25 000  The E 320 and 530i weighed in at almost twice that fifty large in the same trim  It s the greatest price disparity between similar cars that I ve ever seen b Reliability And Maintenance b Against all bets when it was in production  the second generation SHO has proven itself a remarkably durable car  Only three big dollar problem areas have been uncovered on the second generation cars  SHO s driven in the snowbelt during winter have been known to develop corrosion in the engine subframe  It s not a fatal problem  the subframe can be replaced for a few hundred dollars  including labor  The front brakes are another consistent source of trouble  The second generation cars were slightly better but Ford simply put rotors on the car that were too small to stand up to the punishment of a high performance sports sedan  The rotors get too hot and warp when used hard  and like most cars made in the last decade Ford only included enough metal on the them to have them machined and trued once   Maybe  if you were lucky and caught it soon enough  Finally  for all the initial concern about funneling 200 lb ft of torque through a front wheel drive transaxle  the only weak link has been the clutch in the manual transmission models  The brake and clutch problems can be cured with the right application of high performance parts  and the engine subframe is a job that should be good for several years  All in all  not a bad list of  quot major quot  problem areas for a high performance car   And by contrast  the second generation base Taurus models have earned a lemon reputation for blowing head gaskets in their 3 8 liter engines and eating their AXOD E transaxles The SHO models shared no engine parts with the base models and used specially modified transmissions that have proven very durable  Can anyone think of another high performance engine transmission that is more reliable than the base model One problem area that isn t unique to the SHO but needs to be mentioned is the importance of keeping the thermostat and catalytic converters in good condition  If the thermostat sticks open the engine won t overheat  but something just as bad can happen  All fuel injected engines use the engine temperature as one of the major factors to determine the air fuel mixture  If the engine is running too cold  as it will when the thermostat is stuck open  the mixture will be too rich  But instead of this unburned fuel vapor pouring out the tailpipe and creating smog  it is ignited and burned in the cat  Which gets much hotter than it was designed to be and begins to break apart inside  It s not a problem until you lift off the gas from a higher engine speed  like when getting off the freeway  When you do this the airflow through the engine reverses momentarily and because the cats on the SHO are mounted close to the engine if there is any debris in the cat it can be sucked back into the engine  It is just a destructive as pouring metal shavings in the intake  All four areas should be checked out before buying a SHO  The Yamaha engine has proven to be as tough as granite  Aside from possible valve guide wear in hard driven cars there haven t been any major problems with the engine at all   Look for a little blue smoke at a cold startup  hard starting  or oil consumption greater than a quart every 700 miles  Like most of their motorcycle engines  the SHO does not have hydraulic valve adjustors so the clearance has to be set by a mechanic  But unlike a bike it s not a regular occurrence  Ford specifies a major service between 60 000 and 100 000 miles that includes a valve adjustment and replacing the engine timing belt  spark plug wires and control arm bushings  It is a major bill  but nothing compared to the expense of failure if something like the timing belt lets go  and this service on the SHO will cost a fraction of the same service expenses on a BMW or Mercedes as the miles reach this territory   One note  The SHO  like any vehicle with an all aluminium engine  should have the coolant system flushed and replaced every year Other problems fall into the nitpick category  In looking through the newsgroup boards  I was pleasantly surprised to see that most of the problems owners are reporting after five years are the same ones I saw when the cars were still under warranty  most involving interior trim parts  Is my relief confusing  While the lumbar support leaking and the wiper control on the turn signal stalk failing too soon is evidence that there were some areas where Ford missed the mark in design and manufacture  after five to seven years I expected to see new problems emerging as the cars piled up the miles and that hasn t been the case  The good news is  the owner groups have developed inexpensive solutions for all the interior problems if you have a little mechanical ability with one exception  If you notice the driver seat rocks when you sit down or move the only fix is replacing the power mechanism  a bracket with the adjustor motors and trays that move the seat  It s not a safety hazard the seat is still firmly attached to the floor  But if you want to repair it plan on laying out about  300 for a new power mechanism   Pricing and Owner Support b The discovery of the enthusiast and aftermarket support on the web for the SHO has been another pleasant surprise  There are regional SHO owner clubs across America and a strong aftermarket for replacement and high performance parts   Note to gearheads  The level of aftermarket support for the V 6 SHO is as good as you ll find for a Camaro or Mustang  At extremely affordable prices for this class  too  Along with continued parts support from Ford  the SHO is one of the rare limited edition models that hasn t become an orphan in retirement  But it does remain one of the best values in the entire automotive market  The Kelly Blue Book quotes a  10 200 retail price for a  95 SHO automatic with 75 000 miles in my area  Like when it was new that is almost exactly half the Blue Book for a 530i or E 320  But in my area that would buy you an immaculate car  In the last year I ve seen close to a dozen very clean 92 95 SHO s with prices in the  7 000 range  And because most SHO buyers weren t testosterone poisoned young adults  read Camaro Mustang market  the chances of finding a well maintained and cared for car are very good b Conclusion b A SHO has been on my list of cars to have since I worked on them at Earnhardt Ford  It s a terrific sports sedan at an econobox price that has held up remarkably well  and the Mad Scientist in me still gets an evil grin when I think about the things I wanted to do with it   And that was when I only imagine stripping all the power amenities and losing a quick 60 70 pounds just on the interior  Now I can get superchargers that make up to  400 horsepower i  Bottom line  As an entertaining and unique sport sedan to be appreciated for what Ford created  or as the platform for a midlife crisis  the SHO is impossible to beat  It was one of the most easily overlooked cars when it was new  and today it has become a hidden treasure for enthusiasts  And if a Bimmer owner scoffs  as they are wont to do  just ask how he likes his taxi    Brian Igo  i The source for everything you ever wanted to know about the SHO  and one of the best auto fan sites I ve seen on the web  is  SHOtimes com   This is an indispensable resource for SHO owners  All of the DIY cheap fixes I mentioned in passing are there  along with an excellent reference on troubleshooting literally dozens of different conditions and great how to instructions for maintenance This may be hazardous to your wealth  but  SHOShop com  is a wonderful and highly recommended source for replacement and aftermarket SHO parts  Excellent stuff at reasonable prices  and the best designed website I ve seen for a speedshop i br br  
Pos, I have owned my Taurus for 3 years and I put about 60 000 miles on it in those 3 years  I have been very happy with the car in all aspects except road noise  The weatherstripping on the windows seems to make a lot of noise  If you play the radio at average volume you don t seem to hear it  but when the radio isn t on  it seems kind of loud  The ride is great  both front and back seats  You can easily sleep in the back seat on road trips  There is plenty of room for the family up front  and the luggage in the trunk  The acceleration is also very good for a  quot family quot  car  as you can make passes safely  Common repairs are average in cost  brakes tires oil changes  But I have priced some other parts that seemed a little high  rotors 100  alternator 200  these seem about double what the average part might cost  Fortunately I haven t had to replace these parts  but it is something to keep in mind when buying this type of car Overall the 1995 Taurus is a great family with pretty much everything I have expected from this car  If they would fix the road noise it could be almost perfect br br  
Pos, I purchased a 1989 Ford Taurus a few years back and was impressed with the ride and comfort coupled with it s gas mileage  I was a little disappointed with the power thus decided to make that a priority with my next automobile  When I decided to sell  I purchased a 1995 Taurus GL to take it s place  The GL is obviously of better quality than the plain one  Both automobiles were are top performers  The power and performances of this type of automobile  along with it s durability and low maintenance is tops  This automobile can certainly take what is dished out  Excellent quality and exquisite ride make this a most desireable car  I prefer the body style and unique design of the  95 model over today s version  I prefer the unique designs that set apart from the obvious  When design unites with quality performance then that is one unique drive  The sport design catches the attention of the youth in all of us  yet the roominess and comfort interests the adult in us  And the quality and durability satisfies all The Ford Taurus has been first on the race track until Nascar made them slow it down where the other cars could keep up  They ve slowed it down six miles an hour  This is one top performing automobile br br  
Pos, When I first heard my husband say Ford Taurus  I said quot No way  that s a granny car quot  And at 27 I didn t want a granny car  Well  I decided to look at and drive the 95 model and fell in love  It has all the nice features of a more expensive car power windows and door locks  tilt  cruise  keyless entry  etc  but it was actually affordable I have been driving this car for 1 1 1 years now and plan on driving the wheels off  And this from a person that had traded vehicles every year for the past 4 years I had a truck  sports car and a mini van  but will stick with the Ford Taurus from now on  will probably buy a new one when this one goes out  The only problem I have is the doors automatically lock if the car is running  but with the keyless entry  that is not really a big deal i would recommend to any family looking for a good car for their money br br  
Pos, We traded in our Saturn sedan for a Ford Taurus because we needed more space for our baby  The Taurus is an excellent family car with plenty of room inside and in the trunk  So far we have had no major engine or system trouble and we ve had the Taurus for 2 years  The air conditioning and heating provide excellent climate control and the stock stereo is good for everyday listening The brakes ignition switch has come unconnected twice since we ve had the car and has had to be pushed back in by hand  There isn t a lot of leg room in the back seat for passengers with long legs     
Pos, The ford Taurus is a great car for young or old  i didn t want to by it by name   but when i sat in it and test drove it  it was quick for me to change my opinion  When i found out the facts about the Taurus i was pretty impressive  The safety on the car was excellent  a lot lower to insure than other cars  it drove real good and had lots of peep  There wasn t to much i didn t like about the car  it at more gas than my old four cylinder engine  but not much  and it sure out powered it  This is a great overall car with class  and is a car four just about anyone   
Pos, Full Review Ford Taurus SEL 2002 NoBull  The Ford Taurus SEL Wagon 2002 is an example that a car manufacturer can put out a vehicle that will surpass government recommended safety standards and still be a very attractive and stylish automobile  Ever since a coworker bought a Taurus Wagon and rode in it  I always have been very impressed by this car  I thought that not only it looked very nice on the exterior but also that the interior was very practical  stylish and comfortable  Ford has equipped the 2002 Taurus with a series of safety features that makes it one of the safest cars on the road  Some of the safety features includes dual stage front air bags  crash severity sensor  safety belt pre tensioners  safety belt energy management retractors  safety belt usage sensors and driver seat position sensor  With all those innovative safety features it is no wonder that the US government has giving the Ford Taurus a Five Star Crash Test Rating  the highest mark a car can receive for crash test safety testing  The newly design cabin will give occupants an added two inches in rear seat headroom and a full inch in front seat headroom  The front seats are very comfortable even more on the driver side  which is equipped with a six way power driver s seat adjustment including a very good and appreciated manual lumbar adjustment  The interior of the car I drove had a very beautiful and stylish color combination  The seats and door panels were creme with medium dark grey dashboard and trims and the carpet was a light brown  the color scheme really looked smart and was very pleasing to the eyes  The Taurus Wagon can sit 8 passengers so claims Ford  but if you are thinking of 8 adults you will be stuffed in like sardines  Once you open up the fold down rear seats  you have no more room for cargo  I did feel that for a station wagon even with that rear seat down you had very little space for luggage and equipment  The exterior of 2002 Taurus Wagon has very beautiful lines and all its components are very proportionate to each other s  The color of the car I test drove was an eye catching Harvest Gold protected with a Metallic Clearcoat  One things I liked is how high the rear gate opens to allow you to load the cargo  this will definitely helps preventing people from banging their head on the rear gate  The 2002 Taurus Wagon is a real pleasure to drive either within city limits or on the high roads  I had the opportunity to drive it on an extended trip on one of upstate New York most scenic highway  The ride was excellent and the scenery was breathtaking  I really appreciated how well the Taurus wagon hugged the road and how comfortable you are it this car  The Taurus SEL Wagon comes equipped with 4 wheel disc brakes anti lock system and a new Electronic Brake Distribution system mounted on a Power adjustable brake and accelerator kit which makes it easy to find the proper way to adjust the pedals and seat to the driver s choice  N The Taurus SEL Wagon I drove was equipped with a V6 DOHC 24 valve  3 liters  The transmission is an electronic 4 speed automatic overdrive  It had a 4 wheel discs  anti lock system  The sitting capacity is for 8 passengers and the cargo volume is 82 cubic feet  Driving the Ford Taurus SEL Wagon was a real charm  I went for a drive on some of the most scenic roads in North America and what a sight with the Fall foliage turning from green to red  brown and gold and this beautiful gold automobile simply faded in with the natural decor  
Pos, Weve had our 2002 Ford Taurus SEL for about 3 months  and have driven it about 3500 miles  with no unscheduled maintenance  Our Taurus cost us  23 400 without rebates and tax licensing fees applied  It is chockfull with options  everything from ABS  Traction Control to illuminated visors  electronic climate control  24 valve 3 0 L Duratec engine  to leather seating and illuminated perimeter lighting systems  to name a few  We continue to be impressed by its road manners  comfort  ambience and thoughtfully laid out interior  Though some door panels are of lower quality  the price point compensates greatly for the shortcomings  A similiarly equipped 2002 Camry would have set us back atleast  28 000  minus the rebates  of which there arnt many  Overall  brakes   good  could be a tad better  transmission   Excellent  value  excellent  and the overall identity of the Taurus is excellent Wed definitely recommend a Taurus  particularly because of the outstanding customer service weve received at the Ford Customer Relationship Center  1 800 241 3673  and because of the overall quality  performance and comfort of this vehicle  
Pos, I was in the market for a new van and I checked out all the mini vans that are out there  I also began to look at the full size vans  I found that I could purchase a brand new Ford E 150 Van Conversion for about the same amount as the mini van  The features in the mini van didn t even compare to the amenities that were available in the van conversion  I got leather seats  4 captain chairs and a bench seat in the back that lowers with the push of a button into a full size bed  I also have a tv  vcr  game port  to plug in the nintendo  and several power ports  We recently took our family of 5 on a road trip for 6 weeks  We plugged in an electric cooler into one of the power ports and the laptop computer into another power port  The kids didn t fight because they each had their own seat and no one had to touch anyone else  They watched movies  played educational games on the laptop  played the regular games that Nintendo has to offer  slept when they wanted to  etc  This is the ultimate family travel vehicle  I also drive the van as my everyday vehicle and love it  I am bigger than most cars on the road  and taller so I see things further ahead of me  I feel safer and the little extra that I spend on gasoline to run a larger van is well worth the cost  If you are considering a van conversion for your family   I highly recommend the Ford E 150 br br  
Pos, We have an 89  Ford econoline van for personal use  and have had 3 Club wagons over the past few years for transporting our 8 foster children  Our 89  is like a tank  it is kind of ugly too  but that thing just keeps on ticking  We had to replace the transmission recently at a cost of approx   1000  We went ahead and replaced it since it is the only problem we have ever had from the van  It does not have the best gas milege  which is hard with these high gas prices  But it does have 2 tanks which helps sot hat you do not have to constantly stop for gas Also the shades in the windows have rotted  I wish they had been made with a better quality fabric We have had a 90  92  94  clubwagons that took a beating and kept on going  We averaged 50 000 miles a year  The only major problem we had was that the brakes did not last as long as they really should have  The interior stayed nice even with 11 kids on board most of the time br br  
Pos, Last spring  I needed to trade in my rear wheel drive 1994 Explorer Sport for a four wheel drive or front wheel drive vehicle since I was in the process of moving to a cold weather climate  If I d moved to a warmer climate or remained in Virginia  I would not have parted with my Explorer because it was such a great vehicle and had been easy to maintain  and it was paid off My husband and I decided that I should look at SUVs exclusively because having one in the family allows us to do partial do it yourself moves for which the government will pay us for the amount of household goods we move ourselves  rather than the commercial moving company contracted to move the bulk of our things  it s like getting a bonus for bringing along the luggage and essentials that we d take with us anyway  Also  my husband was very insistent that I continue to drive an SUV for safety reasons  I began test driving SUVs and looking around for potential replacements  In the process  I drove a Nissan Pathfinder  a Nissan Exterra  a Ford Escape  a Ford 4 door XLT Explorer  a Mazda Liberty  a Mercury Mountaineer  all new  and various used models  including a 2000 Ford Explorer  Since neither of us wanted to shell out  30 000  for a new SUV  a used vehicle was more within our budget  In all of my test driving experiments  I found that I liked best the handling and turning radius of my 1994 Explorer and the other Explorers I test drove and decided that I would be happiest with another Explorer and narrowed my search accordingly On April 2  I purchased a white  2000 Ford 4 door XLT Explorer  This particular vehicle had been a rental car  auctioned off after a year  still under the manufacturer s warranty  and had nearly 24 000 miles on it  In the seven months I ve owned the vehicle  I ve put another 10 000 miles on it with moving from Virginia to New England  going back for our wedding  and various trips between my duty station and my husband s on the weekends as well as regular day to day use b Gas Mileage  The 2000 model I purchased gets slightly worse gas mileage than the 1994 Sport I owned  The 1994 Explorer had a standard transmission and was about a foot smaller without the additional passenger doors  My gas mileage hovers around 15mpg in town and 19mpg on the highway  Since I have less of a commute  my fuel costs have gone down significantly  rather than up  However  this is not a fuel efficient vehicle b Features  i Safety Features   The 2000 Explorer XLT has anti lock brakes and dual front seat airbags  The vehicle comes equipped with a remote keyless entry system and an anti theft system  The ignition key has a chip inside it so that the vehicle cannot be started except with the ignition key  or by a really good professional car thief  The driver s side door also has a keypad so that if I lock the keys in the car  I can punch in the code to open the driver s door only and retrieve the keys  I ve found this feature very useful when I want to go running  I lock the house keys in the car  run  and unlock the car using the keypad so I m not carrying keys with me  or losing them  while I exercise  The remote keyless entry system unlocks the driver s side door with one touch  With two touches  it unlocks the rest of the vehicles  I like this feature because I can control unlocking the doors independent of each other  by only unlocking the driver s door  I can jump in and lock that door quickly  possibly preventing an assailant from getting into the car through another door  The windows have a lock feature controlled by the driver which has come in handy  During our drive from Virginia to New York  we allowed the cats out of their crates  As they wandered around the interior of the vehicle  one of my cats stepped on the window control of one of the back passenger doors and the window began to roll down  I immediately flipped on the lock and rolled the window back up so that my cat wouldn t get any bright ideas about jumping out of the car at 70mph  I believe this feature will also come in handy when I have children in the car i Cool Gadgets   The 2000 Explorer has a CD player in the dash  as well as cassette and an AM FM radio  The vehicle came equipped with cruise control  air conditioning  rear air conditioning  which my cats and other passengers appreciate  two visors each for the driver and front passenger seats  spare tire mounted underneath  lots of cargo space  about a foot more than the Explorer Sport  six way adjustable driver s seat with tilted steering wheel  power locks  windows and mirrors  two cup holders in the console that accommodate different sizes of drink containers  and an extra charging outlet that my husband uses for his Palm  The overhead compartment for sunglasses is too small for the case  but too rough to put my sunglasses in  The temperature feature is nice  but I find the compass fairly useless and could do without it  I opted for a vehicle with cloth seats instead of leather because I find leather to be sticky in the summertime and too cold in the winter   Repairs and Maintenance  Unlike my 1994 Explorer  I ve taken the 2000 Explorer to a dealership twice and had it repaired under the warranty   I did not purchase the additional warranty since my last Explorer was so reliable and the manufacturer s warranty on this vehicle is good until December 2002  The first repair was for the back window wiper  At first it worked  but sporadically  and eventually quit working at all  The motor was burned out and replaced  I noticed that I had to ensure that the wiper is properly positioned after opening and closing the cargo window  which can be opened independently of the cargo door  The wiper is positioned so that it sometimes gets trapped when the window closes  I m fairly sure that the wiper was trapped and various rental car drivers would turn on the rear wiper and just leave it on  burning out the motor even when the wiper wasn t working The second time I took the Explorer in because the ABS light came on when I started the vehicle and stayed on  indicating that the anti lock brake system had disabled itself because of a problem  My assumption was correct  and the service department made the necessary adjustments to the brakes that had caused the ABS to disable itself  Like the 1994 Explorer  the 2000 Explorer has all the owner operator parts marked in yellow  the oil dipstick  the battery  the various liquid wells  I ve had the oil changed once since purchase and it s due again  At the oil change  no other repairs or maintenance were needed other than the oil was a quart low when I brought it in I am slightly annoyed that I had to bring the vehicle into the dealership for service at all  since I did not once use the warranty on my first Explorer  But the repairs were free so I can t complain too loudly b Handling  As I stated above  I kept coming back to the Explorer because it handled so much better than the other SUVs I test drove  even the slightly longer 4 door model  While driving an SUV statistically protects you more in accidents  I see SUV drivers all the time flouting the road conditions and driving like maniacs  Newsflash people  an SUV will protect one more in an accident  but isn t it better to not be in an accident in the first place  If the road conditions are hazardous due to snow or rain  driving an SUV does not give one license to continue to drive at 70mph when everyone else is going 45mph  The high speeds in bad weather conditions not only endangers oneself and one s passengers  it also endangers the other drivers on the road who have more respect for the necessity of slowing down in bad weather  My other rant concerns the stability of the Explorer  The vehicle does have a higher center of gravity than a car or some of the smaller SUVs  Driving an SUV requires some adjustments  one often has to take curves more slowly so that the vehicle won t tip over  The Explorer is very stable  if one drives it keeping in mind the higher center of gravity  If you think you re a racecar or stunt driver  this is not the vehicle for you b Cost  With my trade in and some bargaining  I paid just under  19 000 for my used 2000 Explorer  which actually worked out to a little bit more than what I paid for my new 1994 Explorer  The 2000 Explorer  at the time of purchase in my area  had a Kelley Blue Book retail value of approximately  25 000  so I felt like I got a good deal  Of course  the dealership low balled the trade in value of my Explorer  but I bargained them down to the price range I wanted  18 19 000   I have a theory about why dealerships low ball trade ins  The consumer pays the sales tax on the new car  If the buyer trades in a car  the purchase price is lowered accordingly and the buyer pays sales tax on that price  The dealership  however  would have to pay sales tax on the used trade in  I assume  To pass that sales tax along to the buyer  the dealership tries to get the used car price as low as possible to reduce their tax while the buyer has to pay more in sales tax on the new car  Since I am a service member with residency in Nevada  I don t have to pay sales tax when I buy a car so the amount I got for my trade in mattered very little to me as long as I got the overall price I wanted  This is not the case for most car buyers  If you know why dealerships low ball the trade in values  please satisfy my curiosity and leave a comment b Overall  I highly recommend the 2000 Ford Explorer XLT  The standard items are very convenient and easy to use  the vehicle is easy to maintain  I have plenty of cargo room for moving 600 800 pounds of my things  or even waiving furniture delivery fees and transporting pieces of furniture home myself  I love this Explorer almost as much as I loved my first one  
Pos, My husband  amp  I recently bought a Ford Explorer after much research  amp  study  We decided on a Sports Utility  amp  then had to decide which one  We had many times driven or been in my father in law s Ford Expedition  This was out of our price range  but we liked what it had to offer  We found that the Ford Explorer had many of those same options that we like so much in the Expedition in our price range  The Ford Explorer is the biggest SUV in it s class   It s considered to be in the small sport s utility class  We have loved our SUV ever since  One of the things that we noticed when searching for a sports utility was that some of the 2 wheel drive SUV s have rear wheel instead of front wheel drive  We decided against the Honda Passport for this very reason  The Ford Explorer 2 wheel drive does have front wheel drive  This is a very important feature if you live in a hilly or snow prone areas  If you live in California  though  it may not be that important to you The higher insurance we now have because we re driving a sports utility isn t a great feature  However  it s still comparatively lower than the insurance cost for other SUV s  Overall  the Ford Explorer is the best buy in its class     
Pos, In a time when SUVs are getting bigger and bigger  Excursion  Suburban  etc  the Ford Explorer Sport stands out as a quality vehicle  not only relative to size  but also overall  It is loaded to the gills with features  with the top of the line models still costing less than  30 000  This car is available in manual  or for just an extra thousand dollars  automatic  It packs a huge V 6 standard  or an optional V 8 under its tiny hood  Because of a shorter wheelbase  all this power is very easy to control  Even with the two door design  there is still room for two passengers to sit comfortably in the back seat  which can be folded down to accommodate skis or other large packages  This car is a great winter vehicle  but if you want to go skiing in it  you may run into problems trying to store longer skis in the back  However  the car is short enough that one can easily access a ski rack on the roof  This another benefit of the Sport over other SUV behemoths on the road today  On the inside  various packages can get you a high end MACH Audio system with a six disc CD changer  Even without this  the second level stereo still has AM FM  cassette deck  and a single CD player  There are several auxilery powerpoints for numerous electronics  It comes with standard AC and heat  both in the front and back seats  There is an extra power door lock by the back gate  so that you can lock the doors after taking stuff out of the back  The car has great handling for an SUV  due to its smaller size  The four wheel drive is easy to use  and results in very little loss of control  This is a great winter car  especially for a young driver  which is the type of person that I would strongly recommend this car for  It handles well in tough conditions  which is very helpful  plus it is not too large  and it is very affordable  So  if you are looking into a 4x4 for a new driver  or buying your first  I would definitely recommend the Explorer Sport     
Pos, We bought our first Explorer  a 1991  we were admittedly naive in the SUV buying field  It was our first SUV purchase  and we were young enough to go for the best  deal   read  cheapest  SUV for sale  Unfortunately  the dealership we dealt with was not the most reputable and hid some of the problems temporarily until the warranty exchange period had expired  Subsequently  we drove an Explorer with bad lifters  anyone who s ever been in that situation can tell you how embarrassing it was to drive around in a car that clicked loudly  causing people to make comments to us about oil changes and vehicle maintenance  and eventually had the engine rebuilt  After this experience and the bellyaching our family and friends heard for over three years  everyone was surprised when we traded it in for a new 2000 model   Why i  they asked   would you put yourselves through this when you just fixed the last one i  There were simply too many good features on Explorers that we loved to NOT own one  plus we knew from talking to mechanic friends that the engineering and quality had improved in later models  Our family camps frequently  so the extra space offered by SUV s is a must have   Why not get a mini van i  you might ask  Living in Michigan with a difficult to plow driveway and the winter precipitation plus camping in rural areas only accessible via very rough two track areas  we ve learned that an SUV is an excellent choice for our situation  It s not just about the looks  although we do like the sleek design  but just as much about function  Also  I play keyboards and will frequently haul a large load of equipment  so secure  sheltered space is definitely a NEED for us  I ve owned a pickup in the past and prefer an SUV for this purpose  Plus we can have more passengers along with the equipment Knowing what we liked in an SUV  we shopped around the SUV market and eventually decided on another Explorer for many different reason  We ended up leasing a 2000 Explorer XLS with a V6  automatic transmission  and lots of nice features b Convenience Features  In addition to standard power locks  there is another lock unlock switch located just inside the opening rear window  NICE FEATURE  This allows you to lock the vehicle after retrieving  one last thing  from the cargo storage area without opening one of the front doors  It s very convenient and a great idea from the folks at Ford The power windows are  well  powerful  The rear doors of the vehicle now each contain a suction cup once attached to childrens  window shades  swallowed up after I had rolled down the window  forgetting the shades were installed  Driver s window automatically rolls down with extra pressure on the switch  but rolling it up requires holding down the switch through completion  Also  the driver has a Window Lock switch to prevent any of the other passengers from playing with the windows  nice for kid safety  bad for a spouse that has angered the driver  Privacy glass is a nice option  All windows with the exception of windshield and front seat windows are tinted nice and dark  not quite limo tint but enough to make anyone in the rear comfortable in a late afternoon driving session  The tint is good quality  has not scratched or faded at all Running boards came with our vehicle  although not necessary for us they are nice for older people who join us  the boards are usable by both front and rear seat passengers  They are very heavy duty  as our salesman can attest  he once had a 350 pound local athlete jump up and down on the bars without causing any sort of damage The air conditioning works wonderfully and is very cold when you want it to be  One complaint  however  is that the output for A C is NOT adjustable  it will only be forced out the vents blowing directly on your face  It would be nice to adjust where the A C blows  The heater works just as well  and in bone chilling Michigan winters it heats up quickly without having to start the engine five minutes before leaving the house Cruise control works remarkably well  maintaining your chosen speed regardless of weather or incline situations you might be experiencing  It is  of course  easy to operate  incorporating the standard buttons which are snuggled up to the airbag area on both sides of the wheel Standard delay feature on the windshield wipers applies  although I m somewhat disappointed to see that a mist feature has not been added  To sweep the windshield only once  the wipers must actually be turned on then quickly turned off  This  I imagine  adds extra wear and tear to the control  versus having a  mist  function that can be tapped to sweep the windshield once or twice The tilt steering wheel is also equipped  I have nothing remarkable to say about this  it tilts the steering wheel  Not too technical here As part of the vehicle that we purchased  we have the towing option  This means that there is a wiring kit provided to hook up to a trailer when you want to tow it  To be honest  we have not used this feature yet  although we are planning to use it this summer to tow a small pop up camper  we need to get a hitch installed first  The rear window is equipped with a wiper that has a two or three delay settings plus it squirts windshield washer fluid  Two complaints here  1  After a while  the wiper only now cleans a portion of the area it once used to  it leaves a large gap toward the top of the window  2  The control is located on the other side of the stereo   it needs to be located closer to the other controls  because it is quite a reach when you re trying to concentrate on driving in weather in which the rear wiper is needed The stereo is quite nice  a CD cassette combo unit with six nice LARGE preset buttons to eliminate a lot of groping and fumbling while watching the road  It is easy to operate and sounds nice  Also it has a mute button for when you are on the phone  although personally I don t use the phone while driving   I ignore it or pull off the road  I can t concentrate on too many things at once  A roof rack tops off our sleek black SUV  It s only been used once  carting a live Christmas tree from store to home  It s unremarkable  but nice when you need it  There are four adjustable little rope loop things in addition to the two cross bars  this was nice when tying the tree on the top We have the fog lamp option  which is really nice when driving at night because it illuminates the side of the road very well without disturbing other drivers  Especially nice in our area because deer making a go at crossing the road at midnight are much more easily seen than without these lights b Safety Features  In addition to dual front impact airbags  side curtain airbags are included for the front passengers  The airbags are actually stored in the outside of the front seats  on the sides  facing the doors  On side impact  these airbags will be there to shield you from the side window  or from the side windows shattering into your face  Fortunately we have never had any accidents in the vehicle so I can t tell you how well the airbags work  The four wheel Anti Lock Braking System  ABS  is installed also  This is a nice safety feature so you don t go skidding out of control by slamming the brakes b Repair Record  So Far  This vehicle has needed only a few very minor repairs since we took delivery nearly 18 000 miles ago  An oil pressure sensor was replaced  and a seat belt assembly  factory recall  There have been no major mechanical or drive train failures so far b Grievances  The one negative part of the vehicle on my list is the interior  The cover for the jack  located on the left wall of the storage cargo area  comes loose  does not open  when driving and sometimes makes noises with road vibration  Also  the interior door handles seem to be cheap  the frame around the handle on the driver s door has gone crooked  Also the rear passenger handle does not seem to be able to open the door  but it is stuck partially out  I checked the child safety latch and that did not seem to be the cause  Currently this is on the list to be checked out during our next visit to the dealership  for maintenance b Reliability  With the extreme variances of weather we experience  we have never encountered a problem with starting or operating the vehicle  It has been very reliable car b Summary  This is a great vehicle for all our needs and uses  It is very comfortable for long trips and fits us perfectly  Overall  we are very happy with the car  We are planning on purchasing it at the end of the lease period and look forward to many more years of enjoyment for leisure  business and hauling around the kids  
Pos, This xmas my wife took me to the ford dealer to see a vehicle  A lot of our friends own and drive Ford Explorers and we have heard many good things about it but to tell the truth  I wasn t too thrilled  That was the 23rd of December  Today I have owned an Explorer for 2 weeks and I can tell you that I am nothing but pleased  It is everything our friends had said about it and more  We bought the Explorer XLS four door  It is roomy  You ride very high and it gives you a great view of the road  The ride is smooth and it handles very well  The  23 000 price tag  includes a c  stereo w cd  running boards  luggage rack  and luxury wheels  The gas mileage is very good  especially for a vehicle this size  and the engine has lots of pep  Up to now  all I can find that is not to my liking is that it idles a wee bit rough for a new car  I test drove others and they all did the same  Overall  I feel that we got a lot of value for our money and would surely recommend that anyone thinking about buying a new car take a serious look at the Ford Explorer br br  
Pos, The Ford Explorer was one of the best investments i have ever made  That stuff that people say about a car flipping over isn t true with this SUV  You feel safe when you re behind the wheel  The car rides smooth and is great for long trips with lots of cargo space  I ve owned this vehicle for 2 months and have had slight problems  This car really hasn t had any problems  and it s reliable  But the minor problems were both fixed by the Ford Company because of the 36 000 mile warranty  The company is fair and honest  and they really know how to treat a customer  Also  my car has been hit four times when it was parked somewhere  It has survived all four instances without even receiving a scratch  I may just be lucky  but i would say that the car is built to protect the driver  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who loves to drive because it is great for road trips or just cruisin  around town  It is definitely an awesome buy     
Pos, I m considering starting an on line ford explorer club  do you think there is interest  I see many such clubs on the web for Mustangs  Camaros  Eclipses etc  There seems to be as many Explorers out there as anything so I think there could be a need for this  I will be contacting Ford to get their support and approval  My idea is to have a free membership where people can enroll and submit the latest news  information and developments regarding their vehicle  e mail me if your interested at kevincwgordon yahoo com   If I get a good response I will start work on the site over the holidays     
Pos, Currently own Dark Wedgewood  Eddie Bauer Edition  4 x 4  I am impressed with the fit and finish of the interior  and the convenience items  Most impressive is the note recorder and garage door opener on the sunvisor  what a surprise and delight when I discovered this feature  Very useful  The acceleration is very good at the bottom end while not so impressive at the top end  The automatic 4 wheel drive feature is also very useful  it just switches to 4 wheel drive when you need it  The vehicle is very stable and comfortable at higher speeds unlike previous year models I have owned  While the styling is a little long in the tooth  I still like the current design  looks very sporty and strong  I personally like the size  just right  I had an Expedition before and found it to be a little big  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a very good looking  stable  and roomy SUV br br

Pos, What can I say other than WOW  This really is one of the greatest vehicles on the market today  The Ford Explorer has great handling and rides very smoothly  The inner portion of the Explorer has more than plenty of room to allow you to drive with the utmost comfort  I would definately recommend this vehicle to anyone  The Ford Explorer is a highly reliable SUV sport utility vehicle  The only downside that this vehicle has is that it eats gas  but then again what SUV doesn t  I would also recommend the Expedition and the Explorer Sport as highly efficient vehicles  If you are a person who just absolutely loves sport utility vehicles  then this is the one for you br br  
Pos, some history I have always been a Ford boy  Had an 84 BroncoII  still have a 86 BroncoII  Stills runs great with 200 K showing and is my current hunting wagon  So my experience with supposedly easy to tip over SUV s runs deep  And thankfully so far I have not had any of the feared rollovers  I purchased this Gem in 12 00 for  22K   a steal in my opinion One bit of advice for SUV wannabees  Don t buy this vehicle or any other SUV if you are prone to radical highway driving or are prone to being distracted by chatting on cell phones with lovers  or using such fine vehicles as a dressing room while driving and especially if you prefer to drink while driving  don t buy a fine vehicle like this  If you do buy it keep both hands on wheel and treat it with the respect which it deserves Now the details  Mine is the 4door E  Bauer with all the gizmos  Leather  data display  digital memo  overhead console  rear sound system  rear a c control  keyless entry alarm  puddle lites  xenon lighting  16 FIRESTONE s  yes I trust em still  but I am on the list for replacement with Michelin Crossterrain just getting some mileage out of the Firestones first almost 46K so far on them  also have the roof rack and trailer package and electric everything  The only option  I think  not on this gem is the power moonroof and to be honest I don t miss it  I had one on the BroncoII and after a few years it began to have a persistent leak in rainstorms So if you keep vehicles longterm like I do skip the moonroof and eliminate the rainstorm possibility  My likes are many and dislikes are nil In the winter the Ford heating system is fast and strong in summer the A C is just as fast and strong  Road feel and comfort in the Explorer are vastly improved over my 86 BroncoII as well as power and towing capability  And when it snows I smile knowing that this beast eats snow for a living  One thing my BroncoII has over the Explorer is its capability off road The 86 had manual 5 speed with manual locking hubs and shorter wheelbase and was lighter as well  With its 2 9 V6 the BroncoII could run circles around the explorer on a muddy goat track  However in the Explorers defense I did recently travel  with two gals on board with all the camping equipment and luggage etc  to the Boardman river in the Per Marquette National Forest in Northern Lower Michigan We were definitely up a goat track more than 1 5 miles to the river bank where we set up camp  And let me tell you this Transport Tank Explorer did not even flinch  Surefooted and comfortable all the way with 10 disc cd changer to boot  How civilized a way to off road  Way to go Ford technical My 4 0 SOHC v 6 delivers and average 21MPG fairly consistently  I live on a dirt road in Howell MI and travel roughly 2 3 of the time on highway  So far  after 45 000 miles I have had no repairs of any kind no rattles no wind noises nothing but joy and bliss  I do ALL my own maintenance and I made sure to get the complete shop manual 2 book set tossed in when i purchased it from Ford  In the near term it looks as tho the brake pads will need to be replaced  45 50K miles not bad at all  and I may even upgrade shocks and toss in a tweaked computer chip to upgrade the standing start performance  As noted by many the explorer has adequate power for passing its off the line performance is a bit dull but hey  its a truck  whattaya want  Other than that I change the oil more frequently than the 10K interval and I check the tranny fluid levels almost whenever I check oil  Also I stay away from automated car washes preferring to powerwash myself and I frequently do  clean cars dont rust proof is my 86 broncoII I look forward to reporting back when this stallion hits 100 000 miles if you want a recommendation Jeep grand wagoneers have cramped foot space on both left and right front cowls  they have more road noise and just don t compare on interior or exterior appointments But they aren t Jeeps anymore since they are technically a Chrysler product Durangos  just plain cheap feel  GM blazer jimmy  bravada whatever  all the same tinny under powered rattling pieces of Detroit junk  The imports  all inferior way over priced copies of GMC and Chrysler products Buy American Buy Ford  Explorer Rocks Detroit Jon S Howell Michigan just north of Hell  MI  
Pos, If so  this is the vehicle for all your adventures  Whether one mile to your destination or 687 miles  it is still the most comfortable ride I have ever had Car buying can be such a hassle  but this buying experience was not  My honey and I chose a beautiful red Explorer  We like Dodge products  but their prices are much higher than Ford  The look of the Explorer was also an attraction next to the price  This Explorer has power everything  seats  windows  etc  The roomy Explorer has seats that fold down and a cover for the back behind the seat  so people don t have to see what you are hauling around  It is so nice to carry our golf clubs in a nice  reachable vehicle  versus a deep  dark trunk or a dirty pick up truck  The radio ahh  it has a CD and a tape deck  How many vehicles have you seen like that It had approximately 3000 miles on it when we decided to take a trip down to Alabama to visit some family  I was so amazed at the comfort and coziness for such a long trip  The radio was blasting and we were singing away  happy as we could be  I never thought we could be so happy driving for a long period of time in a vehicle You would think this vehicle wouldn t corner well  but oh my  you would be so surprised  I don t even feel it going around a corner  It is completely smooth  better than a car  No matter where we have been  I always am comfortable and feel completely safe  Many of our friends have complimented us on how comfortable it is to ride in the back seat  None of them get sick anymore  We can take people and stuff anywhere and not ruin the comfortable exploring we do If you are looking for a roomy  comfortable get around vehicle this is a good choice br br  
Pos, The Explorer is the best equipped  most reliable  and the most comfortable in its class When my wife and I decided to buy and SUV we looked at them all  the Rodeo  Pathfinder  Blazer  and 4Runner  Although the Pathfinder and 4Runner were very nice they just couldn t touch the complete package offer by the Explorer I have a 9 month old and a dog  The Explorer makes traveling them the two of them a breeze  The carseat fits great in the back  and the dog loves being out of the weather  My wife loves how easy it is to get the stroller in and out of the explorer vs  the Ford Contour For value  comfort  resell value  and safety look no further than the Ford Explorer br br  
Pos, When I signed a 2 yr lease for a new Explorer I had never had a SUV  I Can t believe I lived so long with out one  I have 22 000 miles on the Explorer and the my plan is to purchase it at lease end  My only warranty repair work has been the Firestone Tire recall and the rear window wiper motor stopped working  The AM FM receiver is great  I can get radio stations I never could in my other vehicles  However  the standard speaker system is pretty lame and the in dash single CD player will skip if you go over really rough roads The Air condition and Heater is great  This vehicle isn t equipped with the Rear Heater AC vents  but with our summer trips to Florida and Winter trips to Michigan the rear passengers were always comfortable  The front optional Captain chairs are very comfortable and roomy  However  the rear seating isn t all that great for adults  but children seem to be content with the rear seat comfort and they like the added feeling of being  up high  with the wider window visibility  And since the back windows are darkly tinted we don t have the sun bake effect Unlike other passenger cars  my young son has never felt car sick in this vehicle  The Cargo area with the fold down rear seats is great for hauling everything from Christmas trees to home remodeling supplies  The Gas mileage is only about 20 mpg at best  and the passing ability on 2 lane roads is poor  but I assume this is normal for V6 SUV s  hey  this is not a sports car Cup Holders   Awesome  The 2 in the front can hold the biggest drink out there  even a 1 liter water bottle  And the 2 in the back are a blessing with kids Snow Wish I could report but we ve had a couple of really mild winters here in the Midwest and I haven t had a chance to try her out  But she s great for going over curbs  Ford Explorer are everywhere  Here in the Midwest it would probably be very easy to find repair shops and parts to work on this vehicle when it s off warranty  
Pos, On June 28  2000 I took possession of my 2000 Ford Explorer  That summer I was driving a friend s mother to the dentist on a regular basis along with the regular trafficing of children  mine and others  The standard joke was the  little men  dancing on my dash board  In particular we would check out who accompanied the  little man with the pillow on his lap  I am writing this in October of 2001  This beautifully designed car this wonderful car to drive is still a nightmare for the techs at the dealership  Lights on the dash board disappear after a visit and reappear flashing new codes I am quite upset with Ford that they cannot and have not sent someone out from Detroit to fix this car once and for all  Ford has not supported the local dealership  It does in fact drive perfectly  Although I come to ignore the  check engine   check fuel gauge and  fuel cap lights  THIS IS DANGEROUS  In fact there is going to be a problem and it will be ignored  We are used to these lights and their warnings are going to be ignored at the wrong time Of all the parts that have been replaced  for example  side air bags in the fronts seats and air bag in the steering wheel  wiring harnesses  etc  nothing has totally solved the problem  It has actually only changed the flashing codes and the number of lights that come on  We are told that this is the only car with this problem that the dealership has had to deal with  It seems that Ford must have encountered this problem with this model vehicle before or in other models  Nevertheless  this is a Ford problem and should be a priority  I am very unhappy with FORD  Maybe I should be directed to another dealership  But frankly  I think Foard should be sending an  expert  out once and for all I do not want a new car  It could have other problems  I do not like the 2002  I like my car  I want my car fixed  I do not want to do a trade in In all the visits and all the replacements of parts  It all ends up with ANOTHER visit in same symptoms I was told by a woman at the regional headquarters that I had a guardian angel on my dash board  
Pos, This is my first Bronco  I ve always have had full size 4X4 pickups  I m really impressed with its handling and power  Mine has the 5 8L engine  I was only getting about 10 mpg around town and 14 on the highway  I increased this dramatically along with its power  by putting a K N fuel injection performance pack air filter  I also switched out the stock coil with a Crane  I put a 3 inch cat back exhaust  WOW  What a difference  I now get close to 16mpg around town  I even get 12 3 mpg average crawling around the rocks in 4 wheel drive  I took out the auto locking hubs and replaced with Warn locking hubs  It climbs with the best of the factory 4X4 s  Much roomier than my trucks and turns on a dime Happy You bet  
Pos, I just purchased a Ford Explorer  four wheel drive two door SUV  and I love it  This truck is outstanding  Room  The Explorer is very roomy  It has room for several adults  and lots of gear  The back seat folds down for extra storage space  I recently transported two large mountain bikes in this vehicle  and they fit with no problem  in fact there was quite a bit of room to spare Power and Speed  Oh yeah  This thing is  quot zippy quot  It feels like it could fly  The engine certainly provides more than enough power for a vehicle of this size  And with the 4wd engaged it can go through just about anything  I can t wait for winter to get her  so I can run it through some serious ice  snow  and mud Handling  This truck corners very nicely  really grips the road  However I do have one complaint  the steering seems a bit  quot loose quot  a takes too little pressure on the wheel to turn  and this causes it to seem unstable  It really takes some getting used to Brakes  Good  Solid antilock brakes  No complaints there Ammenities  Air conditioner  power locks  power windows  AM FM cassette stereo  all the standard bells and whistles  I just wish it had a CD player Aesthetics  Mine is red  Very red  The lines are smooth  and rounded  It has a very pleasing look to it  The gray interior is a nice counterpoint to the bright red exterior  it provides a calming effect  Overall this thing looks great Safety  Seat belts  natch  air bags  two  Anti lock brakes  That s about all you can ask for In conclusion  a great vehicle  all around wonderful with two points of worry  steering takes some getting used to  and doesn t have a CD player br br  
Pos, Boy  how I hated Fords  At the time I was buying my Thunderbird  I thought it would be the perfect vehicle  I was dead wrong  There was more wrong with this car than right and Ford couldn t seem to find and fix all the problems that existed with this monster We decided to trade it in and buy something new  My  die hard Ford loving  husband wanted a Ford  I wanted something that didn t spend more time in the shop than on the road  Since he owned a Ford truck that required little maintenance  took him to and from work for the past 7 years and had well over 100 000 miles on it  I figured a truck might be the way to go  Ford seemed to make better trucks than cars We began looking at various  trucks  and SUVs  Actually  at that time  our SUV was considered to be a  truck  So much for a name  Anyway  at a local Ford dealer  we spotted a very handsome  SUV  called the  Explorer XLT with 4 wheel drive   Living on Long Island  NY  with a married daughter in the hills of Connecticut  we realized 4 wheel drive was necessary What first attracted me to the Ford Explorer was its looks  I wanted a mid sized  truck  that didn t have the spare tire hanging on the way of the back hatch  Neither did I want something that looked like an over sized station wagon  Seeing the Explorer  I took it for a test drive  I was immediately impressed on its easy handling  Although I had been driving a small Miata  and sometimes the Thunderbird when it wasn t in the shop  the larger vehicle was just as easy to maneuver through heavy traffic  There was no effort at all in fitting into tight parking spots and the mirrors located on each front side door  along with the rearview mirror  makes spotting any surrounding vehicles a piece of cake  My Explorer has  electronic seats  which makes it easier to position for either my husband or myself  Just one press of the button will easily bring you forward or back  Put the button up and the seat rises up  for those people like me who like to sit higher in the seat  Push that same button down  and the seat lowers  for those taller people who need the extra head room  The  lumbar pillow  is adjustable by pressing another button located directly above the seat positioning button  When the lumbar pillow is inflated  it definitely comes in handy to relieve the pressure off my back and make the ride so much more comfortable  Since the  back seat fold down individually   it s most convenient when company comes to visit and we load the back with supplies  This way  should you only have one back seat passenger but a whole lot of items to carry  you can lower only the one seat and your passenger can sit comfortably and enjoy the ride b And speaking of the back b  there is more room than we know what to do with   which  now that we live in Florida  comes in handy for our trips to the north at Christmas  and the addition of so many grandchildren who love toys  My Explorer came with a  4 0 EFI  Fuel Injected  Catalyst  V6 Engine   After all these years  the pick up this engine emits is awesome  Whether doing the  unbearable  30 mph here in my small town of PGI or the  more enjoyable  80 mph on I 75  on our trips north  the engine has never failed to give its best  never once hesitating or failing in any way Our model is equipped with a  5 speed O D Automatic transmission   In addition to the  driver and passenger airbags   the other safety feature I like best is the  4 wheel anti lock brake system  and side door guard beams  For those who have children  or visiting grandchildren  you ll enjoy the  standard child proof rear door locks   In other words  the doors will NOT open from the inside  However  these locks CAN be turned off for the comfort of adults sitting in the rear Another part of my Explorer s standard equipment is the very functional  4 wheel drive CONTROL TRAC drive  electric shift transfer case and rack   pinion steering b In addition to it s  independent front suspension  all four wheels have powered disc brakes  While there are just so many other little things that make this vehicle a dream to own and drive  the most important is that I ve found it to be almost maintenance free  With the exception of periodic oil changes  and finally tire changes  we have had to do nothing else   not even a brake change   yet This SUV  truck  has certainly changed my mind about Fords  Would I buy another FORD  As long as I can have another EXPLORER I think the Ford Explorer is a great car for active people who are looking for something large enough to store and haul equipment and yet  want the maneuverability of a small car  The Explorer offers both  I ve had my Explorer for over five years and have found nothing to dislike about it  In fact  we praised our Explorer so much  that when our friends needed a new car  they went directly to a Ford Dealership and bought the sports model of the Explorer  which is a bit smaller than ours  but suits them fine  But that s their story  
Pos, I highly recommend this Ford Explorer  I own a 1997 XLT V 6 SOHC  I purchased this vehicle b c of its value  great engine performance  still has great pickup after 2 5 yrs  and had all the options I wanted without getting a lot of other useless features Driving this vehicle is very smooth  It has a relatively good turning radius  given its size  I have driven it in rain  great handling when going through mud puddles on the highways  snow  on the way to the mountains  ice  last Christmas  and it is very controlled  amp  responsive  Note this is an SUV so it doesn t corner as tightly as a car sport car  but the pros outweigh this con  also this is the same problem for other SUV s of this size When I was looking for an SUV  it looked for  a minimum of a V6  which shut out a lot of the smaller SUV s  power for the money  I looked at a Jeep Grand Cherokee but would have to get a V8 in order to get any pickup  it would ride high  as opposed to a Subaru  full time 4WD  so I wouldn t have to be changing back  amp  forth  thus discounted Toyota 4Runner  wide back seats  i e  the amount of room to get into the back seat  this discounted a Land Rover Discovery  you have to really twist in order to get into the back seat  lift glass in the rear door  would recommend the Explorer read door configuration  the same on a 97 Grand Cherokee  i e  it lifts up  so you can stand under it  which is quite nice in rainy Portland preferred the spare tire to not be in the cargo area I also required that the SUV has a Sun Moonroof  amp  CD Player Changer As a side note the stereo on this Explorer is very good  no clipping or distortion br br  
Pos, This product has proven completely reliable  comfortable and utilitarian  and I highly recommend an Explorer for a family or adventurer  Either the V 8 power or the V 6 is great  I ve had both  and the V 8 has full time all wheel drive  which is helpful for those of us who commute in snowy climates  It s a strong engine which warms up quickly and started yesterday after sitting in a parking lot for 60 hours in five degree temperatures The creature comforts  like heated leather seats  are wonderful and make for comfortable driving trips  The rear seats fold easily and cargo is protected by an easily removable cargo cover  Driving position is comfortable for my 6 3 quot  frame and also for my smaller friends I haul all sorts of things  and pull a three place snowmobile trailer  with sleds  with no problem I highly recommend the Explorer for the demanding consumer who wants a long term reliable vehicle br br  
Pos, When I bought my first Explorer I owned a Town Car by Lincoln  I never felt very comfortable in it because I always felt it was not me  When I traded it for my Explorer I felt like I had been liberated  I have more fun driving this car than any I have ever owned  I now own my second Explorer and will buy another when the time comes to trade  This is a perfect car for me because I travel a lot and I feel very safe in it and also I am a grandmother to four wonderful children  They have a great time riding with me  The only time I feel uncomfortable is on Sunday going to church and I have so far to step up in a dress  This is a great car and I do recommend it br br  
Pos, I personally own one and I love it  Still the best selling sport utility on the planet  the Explorer rolls into  98 essentially unchanged from its 1995 redesign  although a number of details have been improved  including refinements to the Control Trac automatic 4WD system and  for  98  standard four wheel antilock brakes  An even more significant enhancement  added for the  97 model year  is the option of a new overhead cam 4 0 liter V6 engine and a five speed automatic transmission  The new V6 came along a little too late for our testing last year  so that was our prime focus for  98  and when the dust had settled we emerged with a strong respect for this new engine  With 205 horsepower and 245 ft lbs  of torque 45 hp and 20 more ft lbs  than the standard V6  a 4 0 liter pushrod design the new V6 delivers far better go and hauling power  a 5 800 pound towing capacity  versus 5 300 pounds  than the anemic base engine  Ford also offers a 5 0 liter V8 option  but the 4WD system that goes with the V8 does not include a low range feature  The Explorer s handling was no better than average in our track testing  marked by strong understeer and a slight tendency to lift the inside front wheel when pressed to its limits  On the other hand  its rack and pinion steering system is among the best  both in feel and precision  The same can be said for its braking  and the improved ABS reduces the unnerving pedal pulse and noise that still afflicts some antilock systems  As with the Durango  the four door Explorer s long wheelbase  111 5 inches  and limited ground clearance conspire to make it a marginal choice for tough off road conditions  If that s likely to be on your menu  the two door version is a better bet  with packages designed to enhance clearances and a much shorter  101 7 inches  wheelbase  The Explorer s strongest suit continues to be roominess  even though it s been upstaged a bit in this department by the Durango  The Explorer also has one of the most attractive interior designs of any sport utility  excellent seating  and  like most of its competition  a wide range of features and options  Some of the trim packages the Eddie Bauer and Limited versions  for example will send the price well over  30 000  But if you shop the option list judiciously  the Explorer is still a good buy  with or without 4WD  Our only major caveat  Avoid the base engine  Even though the base V6 is the only one offered with a manual transmission  the new overhead cam engine makes the going much more pleasant     
Pos, In 1995 I met my husband  In 1996 we had twins  In 1998 we bought a minivan  Ack  what were we thinking  But before I go on and on about the dehumanizing effects of driving around in that giant green 7 passenger egg  let me just say how relieved we all were when we finally got RID OF IT and  in 2001  bought ourselves a 1997 Ford Explorer XL I d been enamored with the Explorer since I d worked  briefly  for Ford in the mid 90 s  During that time I had driven a couple of Explorers and really loved  em  Unfortunately  price was a major issue   plus after we had the twins everyone convinced me we needed the dreaded minivan  for more on that see my separate review  The Explorer is just a COOL vehicle  especially up here in the Pacific Northwest where everybody and their neighbor owns an SUV  Yes  the road is practically littered with Explorers   but maybe I m just not the stand out in the crowd type Now for the specifics  I personally  love  that the Explorer has less space than the minivan  From 7 seats to 5   I thought it would be a sacrifice but it hasn t been  There is plenty of room for our family and one extra passenger  We rarely used all 7 seats in the minivan  And speaking of space  that minivan seemed to just attract junk  Well  the Explorer does too  maybe it s not the car  but the kids who attract junk  but it attracts a lot LESS junk and is a breeze to clean out The seating itself is comfortable  roomy enough for our larger than normal derrieres and for both kids to spread out a little in the back seat  In the front seat  there is a nice console between the driver and passenger   including space for CD s  cassettes  2 drinks  and a little slot just perfectly sized for our cel phone  There is also a larger than average glove compartment and  makeup mirrors  on both the driver and passenger visors  In the back seat  there are seat pockets in front of each child   a big bonus  I d LOVE to see Ford  and for that matter  every other manufacturer who hasn t already done so  integrate cup holders into the back seats  It s a nice feature  and it s one thing I do miss about the minivan The rear cargo area of the Explorer is roomy and functional  It holds a LOT of stuff  we do lots of camping  and is at waist height so it s easy to load unload without too much bending and reaching  Also easy to vaccum  1 3 of the back seat also folds down flat  so that you can fit in longer things  We hauled lumber last week and still fit both of us and the two kids in the car There are a couple of features on this vehicle that really stand out  First is the rear glass can be opened separately from the rear door  That way  if you just want to stick some groceries in you don t have to open up the whole door  Another wonderful feature is that the whole car can be locked unlocked via a well placed switch inside the back door  So while I m loading the groceries  I can unlock the doors for the kids without having to fumble for my keys Our Explorer also includes a towing package  making it capable of towing up to 3 500 pounds  about the size of a small travel trailer or boat  a nice cassette stereo system  and roof rack  The vehicle is sturdy  survived a rear end collision this winter that caused  2 500 in damage to the other vehicle and left our car with not even a scratch  roomy  and safe  We also have had the opportunity to use the 4WD a couple of times and it worked flawlessly  It s shift on the fly so there is no need to get out of the car to lock the hubs or anything annoying like that  Our repair bills  knock on wood  have been negligible   we keep the oil changed and keep up on the schedule maintenance  and  I know I m jinxing myself here  she runs like a gem The only major drawbacks to the Explorer are the excessive road noise  sometimes that s nice  though  as it tends to lull the kids to sleep  and the poor gas mileage  We fill up about once a week  and that s with average daily around town driving  A freeway trip to Seattle  180 miles round trip  costs us about  10 12 in gas  Expect about 280 miles per tank full on the highway and about 200 in town  I guess that s just what we expect when you buy an SUV  though   we have to trade  something  for all that space  
Pos, I LOVE my Ford Explorer  As I sat in many a traffic jam in my tiny little aging economy car  I longed at the Explorers that sat in my view  Considering my situation  newly married and planning a family  in a professional job  having hobbies including skeet shooting  woodworking  and other things that would require some cargo space  I felt that the Explorer would be an excellent car for me The best things about the care in my opinion are being up high  looking sharp  and having an excellent balance between cargo space and passenger space  I am no longer ashamed to drive my bosses around  but I can still haul a big pile of wood and tools from Home Depot when I get the urge to try that  weekend  woodworking project  or help my friends fix up their homes  The safety features of the Explorer are also a plus  My wife used to cringe at the thought of me driving around in my little Sentra that had no airbags  let alone crumple zones or reinforced doors  It is very comforting to have a safe car I can t say that I m totally without complaints  but I have learned to live with the few I have about the Explorer  Okay  so it is a bit bouncy  it s a truck  it s supposed to be bouncy  If I wanted a smooth ride  I would ve bought something lower to the ground  And note that I say  bouncy  not bumpy  Though you do bounce up and down over a speedbump or a bump in the road  you are not being racked around like a rock in a tumbler  Its more smooth  like a waterbed  Another thing is that it gets really poor gas mileage  Again  good gas mileage is for Honda Accords and Toyota Corollas  The trade off is worth it to me  If I have to fill up a little more often  it s worth the power and space I have  and the tank is 20gal  so it does last a while  even with the poor mileage Other than the bouncy problem  driving the explorer is like a dream  It handles very well  stops nice  and has enough power to get you around that 18 wheeler that is weaving from side to side  and it is very  very quiet If you have the means and are ready to move into the SUV class  I would recommend an explorer  If you want good gas mileage and a smoother ride  you might want to look at one of the smaller SUVs from those manufacturers that make the high gas mileage economy cars  And if you want a smoother ride  you ll probably have to dish out a few thousand extra bucks and go for one of those luxury manufacturer SUVs  But if you just want a good solid  American  made car  though I d venture to guess that few cars are completely made in America today  that gives you the best features of a passenger car with the versatility of a pickup  I d go for the Explorer br br  
Pos, I bought this 1997 Ford Explorer because I wanted to upgrade to something larger than a car  but not a mini van  I can tow  should I need to  but don t on a regular basis  It s big  but not too big  I love the adjustable seats  Being only 5 2 quot  I can set my seat just the way I want to  And I can see over the hood  I have the tinted windows  which I think keep my explorer cooler in the hot  sunny south  It also provides some privacy  I find it gives me a very comfortable ride  even on long 7 hour trips  My husband drives a Lexus and says the explorer drives like a truck  but that I know  I still think it is a comfortable ride  for a truck It has pretty good pickup for a V6  I didn t get the 4 wheel drive  but plan to the next time around  At the time  I didn t think I would really need it  but it would have been nice to have  The dash is laid out really nice and I love the middle console  It holds my cd s and a tissue box holder is build in  And if I need to slide in something larger than the back cargo area  I can fold down the back seats br br  
Pos, When I was shopping for a newer vehicle I wanted something that would get me back and forth to work  and something that was fun to drive on weekends  I think I got both  So far  I have taken my 97 Explorer Sport four wheeling in places most people wouldn t take their beat up off roaders  I have taken it on trails in the woods  through swamps  and through a few snow drifts  And  when I was done playing  I took it to the car wash  hosed it off  put a new coat of wax on it  and it was ready to go to work on Mondays Like any vehicle  there were some minor problems  one was a bad sensor for the 4 wheel drive selenoid  The truck would shift into 4 low and not come out until I would shut it off and start it again  That was fixed under warranty  and hasn t occoured since  Other than that  the usual maintenance items are all that needed replacing on this truck I would recommend it to anyone looking for a functional  and fun vehicle  It rides and handles great on and off road     
Pos, I own a 1996 Ford Escort  I love it  Even though a 4 door it is still small enough to fit into the smallest parking space  which means alot to me  If your looking for a car that handles great in the winter  this is your car  This car is the most reliable car I ve owned yet  I bought it used and though 4 years old I havent had a single problem with it yet  Also though small it is still quite roomy  I think this car is an all occasions car  good for family  teenagers just starting out  or anyone  Also has an awesome heating system br br  
Pos, Its just a great  reliable little car  We commute 600 miles a week and have 115 000  miles on this four year old car and she s still running strong  In all those miles  we ve only spent about  1500 in maintenance on her  We tried to run her out of oil on a trip to Canada  keep forgetting to get the oil changed  don t get her washed enough  but she still keeps going  Very comfortable  even for 2 larger people in front  Run medium grade gasoline in her and she s very peppy on the highway too  Even with all those miles  our Escort still averages 30 MPG with an even mix of highway travel and in town traffic  We d definitely buy an Escort again and plan to stick with Fords in general in the future br br

Pos, If you needed a commuter vehicle  what would you want most  When I bought my 1991 Ford Festiva new  I went out with a list that looked like this  I want it to be small so I can park anywhere  I want it to run on fumes  cheap to insure  not a lot of bells and whistles to break and encourage theft  and to be ugly enough to discourage the thieves and junkie denizens of my commute destination  It d be a cold day in Hell if I ever found this car up on blocks missing those tiny 12 quot  wheels  I put Sears or Grand Auto  99 00 for four tires on it every couple of years  It has no radio  five of my radios in other cars were stolen in SF with lots of damage to the car  I also wanted a well built  reliable car  so when I learned that the Festiva was built in Korea using Mazda parts  I knew I had found what I wanted The car is now over 8 years old  has over 100K miles  looks like a habitue of the Bowery  but still will travel at sustained speeds of 80 mph  if needed  It continues to get 40  miles to the gallon  My ownership expenses are minimal  one battery  self done oil changes every 2 5K miles  the front disc brake pads replaced once  and it s on its third set of 12 quot  tires  Insurance for it runs about  400 yr  and no one has ever tried to steal it  This  91 horribly ugly Surf Green Festiva is  quite simply  the least troublesome  inexpensive car I ve ever owned  Too bad Ford stopped selling them after the  93 model year I have tried finding body parts for this car in junkyards it got sideswiped while parked  and has lots of ugly bondo  but most in my area don t even have a single Festiva  so people must be keeping them  If you can get one that has been taken care of  don t have too much concern for how pretty and impressive your commute car is  you ll have some trouble finding anything better suited for commuting that will serve you as well as this ugly duckling  No  mine is not for sale  I m going to run it till one of us dies     
Pos, We bought our 1991 Ford Festiva new  and the  quot Korean Komet quot  or  quot Red Rocket quot  is still serving us today  The car gets incredible mileage and almost never needs repairs  and it starts up in even the coldest of weather  It handles well in the snow  and has an AMAZING turning radius  You could park this thing anywhere  I guess the only downside is that if you should get hit in this thing  there s not much car to protect you  Other than that  I think the car has a lot of personality and is a great value  I m a high school student and I just put a new sound system in  and now I can cruise for chicks in my sweet ride while blasting out the beach boys tunes  Woooo br br  
Pos, We are stationed overseas in Okinawa Japan through the AirForce  We are used to driving old foreign junkers that we picked up for about  800 or less  just to last us through our tour and also allowed us to save some money  We decided that since we are leaving Okinawa for Hawaii or Guam  it was time to buy a new car for all of our hard work and sacrifice in paying off bills  Enter the debate Ford Escape   OR  Pontiac Aztec  Now some of you will immediately shout out  Ugghhh  NOT the Aztec  But I fell in love with the Aztec immediately  The amazing features and handling of that SRV are just so wonderful  and yes  I am one of the rare breeds that actually LOVE the styling of the Aztec  My husband on the other hand fell in love with the Escape  which I had to admit  was my first choice before spotting the Aztec  To make a long story short  we chose the Aztec  Don t get me wrong  I think the Escape is great vehicle  Which is why I decided to write this review after our test drive  If the Aztec is too out there for you  or if you just think it is ugly   Then I would definitly check out the Escape THE SHELL  This is a steel shell that protects the entire front end  and continues around the sides using  side intrusion door beams   steel beams along each and every door for protection in a crash  I have to young girls who sit in carseats on the outer back seats  and this feature makes me feel all warm and cozy inside  knowing that they are protected  Throw in the dual and side airbags  and I am on cloud nine  When I found out that the Aztec had this feature also  I was sold  otherwise it would have been the Escape When I drove the SUV  it was SOOOOOOO smooth  NO rattles whatsoever  It was peaceful  my kids were not inside at the time  lol  I felt that it accelerated super fast and powerful  but then again  I am not used to driving state of the art speed cars  Quite the opposite actually  If you are going from a Mustang  or some other sporty get up  then you may be disappointed  I sure wasn t  It cornered wonderfully  Those U turns we all need to make from time to time would be SOO easy  as the wheel turning radius  have no idea if I am using the right terminology  seems very tight  nice sharp turns  Parking was a breeze  as again  the wheel turning radius is nice and sharp  I felt no roll at all when making quick and fast turns  It did score a 3 star rating on the roll over resistance rating for both the 4 wheel drive and 2 wheel drive  This is the highest rating that SUV s have gotten  except for the Pontiac Aztec 4x4  4 door which scored a 4 out of 5 stars  the 2 wheel drive Aztec scored a 3  While there have not been any crash tests on the Ford Escape 4x2  the 4x4 has received excellent ratings  5 stars for the tests done on the front driver side  side drivers side and rear seats side  and 4 starts for the front passenger side test  This is awesome On a low note  I did feel that for the XLT model  the controls and front panels were a bit basic looking  Nothing high tech  but a small tradeoff for the superior safety you get from this SUV  Another thing that bothers me is the gas mileage which is supposedly around 19 24  But I knew this going in to an SUV  I guess if gas mileage is a big concern for you  then forget the SUV and opt for a sedan or passenger car  Another more minor detail that bothers me  With the XLT  you get the 6 disc in dash cd changer system  but only 4 speakers  It seams for such a large  larger than a car  vehicle with an upgraded sound system  they could at least throw in a few more speakers  You can get the 7 speaker system added on  but for about  600 more  Sheesh  On the Aztec  6 speaker is standard I believe  with also some speakers in very back for tailgating usage  Some other feature that the Aztec has that I think would be nice on the Escape are as follows 1  HUD  heads up display  projects speed and other info onto the lower windshield so you can always see it without taking eyes off the road  Come on Ford  add that on the Escape 2 Acceleration volume control  made that term up to  lol  as your speed increases  the volume on your stereo slightly elevates  and visa versa as speed decreases 3 Power outlets in rear of vehicle  Aztec has outlets in the rear  for use during camping  cleaning  etc  Just a nice touch 4 Stereo controls on the steering wheel  I want that  man Oh  and also  the price I was quoted is from the AAFES Military car sales  If you are military  I highly suggest that you check out your AAFES dealership before considering another dealership  Great experience  The only options that I did not get with my price were 1 leather seats  2 the side stepping bar  I did get the Choice XLT model  higher than the Value  and lower than Sport  but did not want Sport anyhow   Thanks for reading my review  I am not a car professional  but wanted to comment on these 2 vehicles in a safety comparison  Good luck in your SUV purchase  I am also writing a review for the Aztec  so check it out if you are interested GOOD LUCK  
Pos, I traded in my Lexus   so I m new to SUV s and American made vehicles  But I was looking for something that would give me more flexibility and was fun to drive the 2002 Escape fit the bill  I first test drove the sister SUV the Mazda Tribute and was instantly hooked  When I started doing research I discovered that Ford sold the identical  minor trim changes  vehicle but usually at a lower price   and Ford was offering much better financing terms and more for my trade in A week after taking delivery on my 2002 XLT V6 with leather interior and the premium sound system  I went on a 4 day road trip and must say that overall I found the truck very comfortable  very economical  and fun to drive  There is considerably more road noise than with my Lexus   but I figured it was just because you are sitting up so much higher and you have all that trim and luggage rack that adds to the wind noise  I have read several reviews that talk about engine noise   I have heard none   just wind noise at high speeds  I do have a complaint about the placement of the steering column shifter   it does block easy access to the volume button on the radio   but once you get use to it   not a problem  There is lot s of cargo space which I have really enjoyed   a nice retractable cargo cover  and an adjustable luggage rack  I guess I m spoilt by the Lexus   but I find the carpets in my Escape to be a little skimpy   I just keep reminding myself that it s a truck  The leather seats are comfortable by not luxurious  the stereo on the other hand is actually better than the Lexus   great system  I like to drive with my headlights on and the 2002 comes with auto lights out after about 2 minutes but the irritating thing is the dinger still sounds when you leave the lights on  I don t see the point of having an auto lights out feature if the alarm is going to sound  
Pos, I am not going to write about stats and specs for this SUV  That is mostly available in car magazines  and many other websites First impressions 1  From the outside  it looks larger and  meaner  than a comparably priced Toyota Rav4 or Honda CRV  It looks tough and durable and not quite as  cute  as other comparable mini SUVs 2  The two tone body color takes a little getting used to  I liked the silver color  so it blends a bit better with the black 3  I really like the factory alloy wheels  It looks sporty  rugged  and classy at the same time 4  The front looks ready for off road  similar to an Explorer The interior 1  Very nice  The leather is comfortable and I was impressed with number of features it offers for the price  It has power front seats  large moonroof  very roomy for a small SUV  and the gauges are nicely located and very easy to read  2  The Mach Audio system is probably one of the best factory sound system I have listened to  It comes with 6 disc changer  and 7 speakers  3  The controls seem to plain such as the AC controls  vents  etc  Also  one complaint I have was it has no air vents for the rear seats  The drive 1  It was a bit on the loud and rough side 2  Acceleration is car like but I was hoping it would be faster since it is after all  a 201 hp V6 carrying a fairly light load  I have driven the 4Runner  which has less power and heavier  but seems to accelerate just as fast  I suppose the powerband of the Ford s Duratec V6 is geared towards more on the upper RPMs  3  With its independent suspension  the Escape handles like a car and show no hint of tilt or body roll on a fairly fast 90 degree turn 4  The power brakes are good but does not have the car like stopping power This SUV provides an overall good balance in terms of 1  Price 2  Features 3  Performance And one last thing  this SUV does not cost too much to insure  
Pos, I recently had the chance to rent a loaded Escape for a week long business trip an experience I have been looking forward to having  Overall  I liked the Escape a great deal  but I m not sure I d plunk down my own hard earned dollars to own one The Escape does everything well  It is amazingly roomy and well laid out for such a small vehicle  Seat comfort was great  there was TONS of cargo room  ride and handling were very enjoyable  and the V6 performed well  Ford offers lots of well thought out gadgets and toys in the Escape things like armrests and storage compartments and radio controls feel especially well placed and engineered  The Escape was easy to drive for long periods and was an enjoyable  airy place to spend time  On the highway and back roads  the Escape handles better than almost every other SUV I ve ever driven  large and small  I even had the chance to take the Escape off road a little bit  and it was less happy there  The Escape felt much more like a tall station wagon than a true SUV while off the pavement  I recall my mother s Explorer feeling much the same when taken off the beaten path  Of course  most folks will never use the Escape s SUV ness in anything other than snow and rain  and I m sure that the all wheel drive is perfect in these situations  However  the AWD was slow to engage off road and the minimal ground clearance  for an SUV  didn t help matters My complaints about the Escape are  ironically  centered around its strengths  Though the Ford is very good at lots of things  it seems to have sacrificed being truly great in any areas to be so competent overall  The V6 is powerful  but it sucks up gas and is VERY noisy  So much so that the radio has to be blared to drown out the sound  As long as you have plenty of CDs which you enjoy on hand you will never mind  but there is no Escaping the fact that this is a noisy  and thirsty  vehicle  The ride and handling are great in 90  of situations  but one cannot sling this thing around a highway off ramp at high speeds  Finally  to make such a fine vehicle it feels that Ford has cut costs in building materials and construction  The Escape I drove had lots of rattles and felt and sounded generally loose  but this may be due to the fact that it was a rental and rentals are usually beaters  Still  a brand new car shouldn t have felt so loose I have been thinking about getting a small SUV  and the Escape would be high on my list  So would a number of other terrific choices  though  I feel that a Jeep Liberty is just as pleasant a place to spend time  and the Jeep has lots more character  both inside and out  The Jeep also handles poorly  though  and is just as thirsty and loud as is the Escape  Then again  the Jeep would go literally anywhere  on road or off  I feel that the new Land Rover Freelander is similar more uniqueness but less utility  I think if it were my   on the line  I d go for the redesigned Honda CR V  Sure  it s be a little slower than the Escape and certainly more dull to both look at and drive  but the Honda s quality and fit and finish would be impeccable  it would be more efficient  and have even more room  Of course  none of this changes the fact that the Escape is a great all around car and I would certainly recommend it to friends who have lots of   for fuel and who are already hard of hearing  
Pos, We live on a small farm and needed a truck to haul feed and livestock  Since our children are now teens we knew that the extended cab was ready to be upgraded to a full crew cab  The full crew cab gives plenty of room for up to six people  This pickup handles all of our family s needs  It is a workhorse for the farm and a pleasure to drive  and ride in  as a  quot family car quot  The 4 wheel drive is great when it comes time to get hay out of the field  or when off road  The power stroke diesel gives all the power you could want when passing on the highway  even when hauling or pulling a load  The new  quot scalloped quot  front driver and passenger windows are really a great help for seeing small cars beside you  This is a great vehicle for people that need to haul and have a family  Because of the relatively low gas mileage I would not recommend it for total pleasure use or for singles or couples  Although the diesel engine gets better mileage than a gas engine br br  
Pos, My F350 is a fine truck however having problems with Ford fixing two major problems  Problems are as follows 1  My truck is a early model  The air intake is in the fender well and I have a problem a loud sucking or as I call it a loud howling noise from that area  Ford s district mgr refuses to fix the problem  Dealers in other areas have solved this problem by rerouting the air intake to the front grille like the later Ford models and this does fix the problem  2  When I start the Powerstroke after setting for awhile I get a loud thump noise from under the hood  I continually complain about this but nothing seems to be done to fix it   
Pos, The 1999 Ford F 350 has an awesome look to match it s awesome abilities  The model we purchased has four doors  the long 8ft bed  4WD and is toped off with the Triton V 10 engine with enough horsepower to satisfy any truck fan  Big and roomy  Ford made this truck to complete many tasks that will fit everyone  From hauling 8ft sheets of plywood  moving a friend  taking huge loads of branches to the local dump  taking a long family trip  or even for a mountain hunting trip  this truck is truly built ford tough  Personal recommendations  Put on a camper shell if you want to use it for travel  You can fit 6 people very comfortable  so having the shell will enable you to put all of your travel needs  as well as shopping bags in an air shell for both room and protection  With a shell on the long bed  this truck will be bigger and badder that the suburbans  and even Fords new Excursion  Also  putting a supercharger will bulk up the already tremendous amount of horsepower so I wouldn t call it a necessity  Put on a 2 or 3 chamber Flowmaster muffler to get out that loud V 10 sound  and if you like custom vehicles  change the tires and rims to either get a Lower  sleeker look  or a higher  tougher look  Take it for a test drive and feel the power of Ford Triton engines br br  
Pos, The Ford F 350 with the 7 3 Turbo diesel is the best truck on the road  With its 500lbs of torque it will pull just about anything  Horse trailers  trailers are no problem for this truck  it pulls a hill with a trailer behind it as if it was not there at all  Comfort is a given in this truck  wether you get the 40 20 40 seats or the Captains chairs you will ride in comfort  The adjustable seat belts make it easy for a tall or short person to be comfortable and not have a strap rub them over their neck  The mileage factor with the 7 3 is fantastic  when you are not pulling a load 22 mpg is normal and under load 18 is average  You will leave a Dodge Cummings in the dust if you are both pulling a hill  the power is fantastic As the saying goes  quot Try it you ll like it quot br br  
Pos, At the age of 16 I bought my first 1992 f 150 it was a great truck it had 100 000 miles on it and still ran like a top  I added a K N filter and it upped my horse power and shortly after that i added dual exhaust and man did that baby roar  I had very little engine trouble  In that fall of 2003 I sold this truck but not because of the truck I just wanted bigger and better so I bought my second 1992 F 150  I can haul anything that I need and have all the horsepower any country hick like me would need  I have never been stuck even though I have tried  I have many late night calls to pull vehicles out of ditches or mud and have not had a problem yet  This truck also has over 100 000 miles and I have yet to have any engine or transmission problems probably due to the fact that the engine is very strong and has great get up and go power and the tranmission has very smooth shifting  I would put my 1992 F 150 against any full size truck out there Now I am now 18 years and have been a F 150 lover for 2 years now and will never go back  Not only have I not had any mechanical problems but no structural problems either I am more impressed with this truck than any other  The handling on this vehicle is decent the turning radius isn t the best but all around it is alright  I haven t ever had a load on the vehicle that has ever effected the handling  The brakes on the F 150 are excellent with very good stopping power  The only thing I could say is that they are relatively touchy If you are out there and you are looking for raw towing power along with horse power and a comfortable smooth ride on and off the highway with a drivers seat that you could sleep in that will get you around anywhere then the ford F 150 4 wheel drive is the way to go One drawback to this vehicle is the gas mileage on the regular stock truck I would get about 16 17 mpg on the highway and about 13 14 in town but now that I have the 33  tires and the 3  body lift I get about 9 10 in town and 11 12 on the highway So far with my F 150 I have added many accessories to my truck like  3 inch body lift  33 inch mud brute tires  5th wheel hitch in the middle my truck bed  K N high performance air filter  Delta toolbox  Reese hitch So if you are out there and looking for a truck with all around use this is the one for you it hasn t let me down and I don t believe it would let you down either  
Pos, I bought my wagon used in 1994  It s a 1992  Low mileage and price is what first brought me to this car  Upon test driving it though  I really found that I liked it even better  It was a nice ride  I m not one for mini van s or SUV s  so this was a good option for me  I ve never had trouble fitting anything and everything in this wagon  Put it this way  2 adults  1 child with car seat  luggage for 10 days  and 1 120lb dog all fit in this wagon  And the only problem that I have had is the fan that cool s the engine that should come on and off depending on temp  doesn t  and still cannot find anyone who can fix it  Though I have figured a way around it  I know that when this wagon need s to be replaced  no question in my mind  it will be another Escort Wagon br br  
Pos, I used to own a 1992 Escort in college  and it was a great car  It was a 5 speed with the dual overhead cam which made for a very sporty ride  People were always surprised by the performance  and I was always very pleased with it  The interior was extremely comfy  with lots of room in the back seat  4 door  pleanty of head and leg room  and the trunk had generous space as well  I bought it used and never had to fix anything on it  well once I had to replace the battery  It was a wonderful car  and always reliable and dependable  If you re thinking about buying a used one in this era  I would strongly recommed that you get one with the cam  you won t regret it  I loved the car br br  
Pos, Having recently purchased a 2003 Taurus  age is finally starting to get to me  At least I am not too old  as I did not even consider a Buick LeSabre  Ain t middle age great Of all the mid to large size cars available in this class  one has the choice of the Chevy Impala  the Pontiac Bonneville  and the Dodge Intrepid from the domestic manufacturers  and the Nissan Maxmia  the Honda Accord  the Toyota Camary  the Mazda 6  and the Subaru Legecy from Japan  and the Hyundai Sonota from Korea  plus the Volkswagen Passat from Germany The Impala would not have been a bad choice as it is slightly better equipped for about the same price  however the engine is of a cast iron pushrod design that has been around since Louis Chevrolet built his first car in 1912  The interior looks postively cheap  like it was lifted right out of a Chevette  The Pontiac has sooo many tacked on plastic body clading it looks like a third grade car design competition gone amok  The issues I had with the Dodge is that the 2 7 liter engine has a dubious history as I have seen many fail prematurely due to the water pump failing and the pump itself is built into the block All of the cars from Japan  except the Maxmia and Subauru  come standard with 4 cylinder engines  I prefer a 6 cylinder  but where they are an option  this prices them a couple of thousand more than a Taurus  I had driven a Hyundai Sonata  and was somewhat impressed  however it was smaller inside  and I later found out that Hyundai had lied about the horsepower figures for the 2 7 liter engine and had to offer consumers cash or an extension of the warranty The Volkswagen was just too expensive for the amount of room and features Which brings us back to the Taurus  I know that the resale value will not be as good as the Japanese as these vehicles are the choice of rental car companies and commercial fleets  There are simply a ton of Tauruses on the roads and the law of supply and demand dictates that when it comes time to sell or trade  don t expect much  The plus to this situation is that normal wear and tear parts will be easy to come by and downright cheap to obtain I purchased a Taurus SES with the Sport package  With this I received the 3 0 DOHC Duratec V6  two tone cloth bucket seats  special alloy wheels and a rear spoiler  plus Ford threw in a free sunroof  The wife was parcial to getting the leather interior and the wood package  however with the dog to be riding in the back seat  perhaps cloth was the better choice  Stepping up to the SES trim Duratec combo helps avoid having the car appear to be a rental vehicle Driving the Taurus reveals that the Duratec is smooth and powerful  and with a chain driven camshaft design  I will not be worring about replacing the drive belt  It is reasonably quiet and the 4 speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly  however it does not allow manual selection for the full range of ratios  Wind noise is not at all objectionable  and the seats are comfortable  The EPA rates this as a large car and interior room is very good  with the exception of the front wheel well intruding on your left foot space  The brakes  std ABS in the SES  are very good  Steering with the variable assist is linear and handling is also very good What you don t get for your money is somewhat minor  Rear disc brakes are only available in the wagon model  however with the front brakes handling 80  of the braking force  this is a non issue  A power adjustable passenger seat is only available in the top of the line SEL model  so your front seat passenger will just have to deal with that the best that they can  Side air bags are also a option  Some of the places where Ford also saved money is in the use of cheap feeling switches  however they all do work and perform their intended uses  The only major gripe that I have is that the cheap plastic console squeaks and that is houses the equally cheap 6 disc CD changer magazine that was made in China  I could have done without the rear spoiler  as I seriously doubt that it adds much downforce or makes the car handle any better With Ford pushing the metal out the door with incentives  this allows one to purchase a fully equipped Taurus for the price of a fully equipped Honda Civic  Nissan Altima  or Toyota Corolla  To me  it was a no brainer  With  4000 in rebates and the ability to purchase at dealer invoice  the initial value is just too hard to pass up  
Pos, When I first started looking for another car  I knew I wanted an SUV of some type  I do a lot of traveling on the road and I like to have room for all of my luggage  camping gear and emergency equipment as well as my passengers  This baby does it all with room to spare and good gas mileage too I had looked at the Montero  the 4Runner and the Blazer first  The Montero is nice and roomy  but the mileage sucks  it s expensive and the insurance on them is outrageous for someone my age  21 at the time  Then I looked at the 4Runner  Nice  decent mileage and it has a fair sized cab  but again the insurance was killer plus they seemed to be breaking down a lot and were not cheap to fix  Now the Blazer was really nice  Good mileage  fairly cheap insurance  but it was really  really small inside  The back seats were barely there Then I came to the Ford dealership  They showed me a few Explorers and I was hooked  They have a good V 6 engine  good sized front and back seats  plus a decent storage area in the rear for all my gear  It also has an adjustable luggage rack on top and it got 20 miles to the gallon highway and 17 city  Mine is the 1991 Sport Edition so it only has 2 door  but that s all I need anyway  It is a 5 speed manual transmission  a must for me  and it has push button 4 wheel drive with low range  It also has a main dome light and 2 reading lights for the driver and front passenger  I signed the papers for it the same day and I have not had anything to complain about since then  and that was almost 4 years ago  I have had it in the shop for basic maintenance and had to have the radiator and water pump replaced  my fault though  but other than that it has run great for me  It always starts for me no matter what the weather is  I have started it in 100  and in  40 below without any problems  Also  when they say 4 wheel drive they mean all 4 wheels  Not one front wheel and one back wheel like some other companies do Really the only thing I can complain about is that there is only one cup holder and it is inconveniently located behind and below the shifter knob  No problem for soda cans but a Burger King cup gets knocked out every time I shift to third gear  Other than that minor bit  it s a great SUV and I couldn t be happier  I just topped 100 000 miles and I m sure I ll see 200 000 easy br br  
Pos, I have had my  1991 Ford Explorer XLT  for a little over a year  I bought it with 105 000 miles on it  During this time I have driven it for over 30 000 miles  I have had it in the shop only for scheduled oil changes and tire rotations I drive every day for work in all weather conditions  I also drive my Explorer off road from time to time  The Ford Explorer runs well and has excellent handling on snow and ice as well as in the mud  I was particularly happy with my Explorer on December 28  1999 when I was driving to Columbus from Cleveland as the first winter storm of the year blew through blanketing the streets with snow and causing white out conditions  I was driving south on US23 toward Columbus and I counted 14 cars along the side of the road  One accident was a 6 car pile up  After seeing these accidents  I was cautious but I felt comfortable in my Explorer  Needless to say I arrived home safely and I credit much of my safety to my Explorer I have compared it to a Chevy Blazer of a similar year and the Blazer does not compare  Not only does the Explorer have more storage room  it is also much more comfortable to drive My Ford Explorer is very reliable and I feel safe driving it  I highly recommend the purchase of a Ford Explorer br br  
Pos, I have owned a  91 Explorer Sport for nine years  My driving skills are very aggressive  especially off road  This has placed me in several awkward and embarrassing moments due to my driving  The Explorer came through everytime  and I don t even have all wheel drive capability  Parts can be expensive and hard to find  but there worth it  I have never once broke down or have experienced a component failure  I do recommend upgrading stock tires to more aggressive tread and a K amp N Filtercharger for increased performance  Explorers do need constant care and attention  If this is done  you too may own a vehicle and still love it after 10 years     
Pos, I am extremely happy with this vehicle  I am a  over protective  mom of a teenage girl about to turn 17 years old  We gave her this vehicle a 1991 Ford Explorer XLT for her birthday and to ease up on our schlepping back  amp  forth during very hectic work weeks  Well  I was quite the wreck when she turned 16 last year and was got her drivers license  What parent isn t   We bought the Explorer from a private party who practically gave it to us  They didn t want the hassle of having every Tom  Dick  and Harry coming over to see it  After some initial repairs were made we brought it in to the owner s mechanic and had the front brakes done  along with the power steering unit everything else was in order we got the vehicle for  2 750  Yes  you read that right  Although it does have 90K miles on it  They were initially asking  4 000 then down to  3 000 then after repairs we had the gall to negotiate to  2500 we then settled on  2750  My daughter is the proud owner now and is quite smitten with her  brand new  SUV  I want it    I feel very comfortable with her driving it  It s a safe vehicle I like the size and sturdiness of it  She handles it beautifully  It even has a tilt sunroof for a  91  It s almost in excellent condition except for some minor rust on the underside and a missing handle on the inside  I highly recommend this vehicle br br  
Pos, The 95 FORD Contour is really a great car for anybody  It runs great every time I start it up  I ve had it for 6 years now and absolutely no major problems  Just a few minor fixer uppers  The reliability is amazing  The quality of the interior is nice  nothing fancy  but definitely nice and comfortable  The air conditioner vents are nicely designed and well placed  The over all look of the inside is well done  The v6 engine is nice and powerful  perfect for anyone The 95 Contour is also very spacious  Especially in the front  The back seats aren t too cramped though  and they could fit any average sized person comfortably  I am really impressed with the space this car has I can t say enough about the over all quality and reliability of this car  Very nice for long or short trips  Highly recommended  
Pos, I bought my 1995 Contour brand new  off the showroom floor  in July  1995  From day one  it has been a joy to drive comfortable  easy to handle and fuel efficient  And the air conditioner works very well a critical issue in the Texas heat While I don t drive every day  many of my trips keep me in the car for one to five hours at a time  The Contour makes those trips easy It is always a challenge to find a car both my 6 5  husband and 5 1  me can drive  I don t have any trouble reaching the pedals in the Contour  and my husband doesn t hit his head on the roof The car now has 70 000 miles on it  It has required minimal maintenance  you know  the usual  tires  brakes  oil changes  etc  and has been incredibly dependable  The only problem I can remember was with the sunroof switch  not factory installed  When the car sat in the sun and got hot  the switch wouldn t work  That took two trips to the dealership to get fixed Looking at the car  it was not my first choice  I thought  and still do  that it is a sort of boring little lump  My husband begs to differ he loves the styling  My mind started to change the second I sat in the car  and I was sold as soon as I drove it  It also helped that I found one in teal  a color I love My original plan was to keep this car about six years  however  as we get closer to the six year mark  I find myself thinking I don t want to give it up that soon   Update  10 02  I recently sold this car  after owning it 7 years and a couple of months  It had about 93 000 miles on it  and was still virtually trouble free  At one maintenance visit  the dealer service department mentioned that the AC clutch was a little loud  but didn t recommend doing anything because  in their words  the AC was  pumping out ice cubes  I hadn t heard the noise  and the AC continued to work well  In the last few months I owned the car  I noticed a bit of a squeal in the AC  but it continued to cool very well  even in the hot Houston summers   And you wouldn t hear the squeal if you turned up the radio a little   o   I loved owning and driving this car  The only reason I decided to get a new car was that I take quite a few long road trips and I was concerned  at nearly 100 000 miles  that it might become less reliable  I didn t want to have the car s first breakdown on some deserted stretch of Texas highway  My original review of the 1995 Ford Contour stands  It was reliable  economical and comfortable  And I hope it s new owner enjoys it for many years to come  
Pos, I bought my Contour with almost 100k  and it still runs great  It is very reliable  and has nice creature comforts  CD  sunroof  power everything  It is not very flashy  or overly sporty  It doesn t have much get up and go  but I do feel very safe with dual airbags  and traction control  It gets decent gas mileage  and seats four adults comfortably  I would recommend this car to someone looking for endurance at a good value  This car is also very easy to work on  and parts can be found at most major parts stores  I would recommend attempting personal maintenance over dealer maintenance which I was disappointed in the one time I took it to them br br  
Pos, I got a 1991 Ford Mustang GT from my parents back in 1991 for my senior year  They always told me they would buy me and my sister one good car to go to college on and that was it  After that I would have to buy the next one  Little did I know that I would still be driving this car almost 10 years later  Well  that s exactly what I am doing and I haven t had it in the shop for more than minor work ever  I have never had to take it to the shop to do any kind of work on the engine  transmission  or other major parts  There are many pros to this particular car  There are also a few cons  I will list each of these below  Keep in mind that this is a 10 year old car that has run like a charm ever since I got it b Pros  1   Acceleration and speed    I have never had a problem with the acceleration of this car  In fact  it will almost go too fast  I have had it at an ungodly speed  that I do not wish to diverge here  It will get up and go with the best of them  2   Handling    I went to school at the University of Arkansas my first year of college  The road I chose to take was very windy and I loved it  Never once did I lose control of this car or even have the tires slip  I typically doubled each suggested speed limit up to around 30 mph 3   Looks    Even though this car is 10 years old  I have tried to keep it looking good  especially on the outside  I still get some looks from people while I am driving because the car demands looks from others  It is still fun to drive around town and see how many people turn their heads  This particular model was the first year Ford put five star rims on it  In my epinion  this makes the car much more appealing to the eyes b Cons  1   Cheap minor parts    I think that Ford spent all of their money on the engine and transmission  The major problem I have had with my car is minor parts breaking  I have replaced the inside and outside door handles more than once  The speedometer is broken  The hydraulics for the hatch won t hold up the hatch anymore  These are the majority of problems I have had  The door handles were just poorly made  They have some plastic parts that aren t very strong 2   Service at dealership    I know this isn t really dealing with the car  but our local dealership is very hard to deal with  It is Smith Ford in Conway  Many times they refused to fix something that they actually screwed up  I had them put on a new door handle many years ago and they scratched the paint  They agreed to repaint the door  but it had new paint on it  The rest of the car had paint that was around four years old  It didn t match and you can still tell it today 3   Spare tire    I know this is very minor  but I really wish they would have included a regular sized spare tire with the car  The donut tire is really small and  if you were in a bind  you can t drive it very fast So  there are a few pros and cons to the 1991 Ford Mustang  I feel that the pros heavily outweigh the cons  Yes  I would like to have a new car  but I m not getting rid of my pony  I plan on keeping it forever  I am going to rebuild it  fix the minor things that are wrong with it  and get a new paint job  Then my wife and I can cruise around town in a 30  year old car that looks brand new  Actually  I hope one of my kids wants to drive it when they get old enough br br  
Pos, I ve had my 1991 Ford Mustang LX for 3 years now  I had just come off a bad relationship with an 86 Cadillac and found this rather sorry looking Mustang for sale by a private owner  I picked it up with hopes of exchanging it within a year for something better  but it seems to be getting better with age  I did an awful lot of cosmetic work on the car because it s previous owner did not care for it properly  Now it is not only looking almost like new with it s original paint  but well accessorized as well  I ve added many performance products to this 2 3L car and have gotten the response of a V6  while maintaining the exceptional gas mileage  She spins tires in third gear  which  for the engine type  is impressive  It gets me to work and back  it s quick off the line  it looks great  and I ve had many offers  It s over the 110 000 mile mark and NO LEAKS  It has visited the shop about 3 times for regular maintenance  radiator  clutch cable  differential gasket  Other than that  I ve done all the tune ups and oil changes  Runs like a dream  smooth  quick  and just plain exiting  Unfortunately  you see too many of these cars on the road looking like they haven t seen a rag or sponge in years the better you take care of it  the better it will take care of you  
Pos, Don Garlits  the  quot Big Daddy quot  of drag racing  is who I think of after test driving a new 1998 Ford Mustang GT  Before driving one  I thought of the Mustang as just another sporty looking spineless car for secretaries and factory workers to flog to work and back When we climbed into the car s black interior  I instantly noticed the exceedingly plasticky dashboard  the uncomfortable seat  the flimsy door panel  the obstructed rear view and the infant sized rear seat  Although the actual driving position was nearly perfect   steering wheel  shifter and brakes were precisely where I needed them to be  I was pretty sure the car s only redeeming feature was the brand cache of the horse dancing on the grill As soon as I turned the key  I knew I was wrong  Ford s 4 6 liter modular V 8 emits a tense growl through the exhaust pipes at idle  Blipping the throttle was a sensory experience  even at a standstill  An engine with a snarl like this one means  business i  even if its 230 horsepower is lower than the perennial competitor  the Camaro  I slipped the perfectly angled shifter into first and idled   no  make that  burbled  out to the road First gear came and went with a mechanical howl  and second gear did much the same  Then my wife informed me   quot we re already going 40 quot  And so we were  in about as much time as it takes to read this  The city ended  and the road opened up into a divided highway and I explored the 40 70mph roll on power  With a muted scream  the  Stang accelerated straight up to speed At cruise  however  the mechanical noise which is so electrifying under acceleration became plain old noise  making conversation hard in the pony car  I could imagine long road trips with this car becoming an exercise in the  quot What did you say quot  maneuver But then I came to the next stoplight   yes  on a divided highway  and had a chance to dip into the V 8 s strong point  Burnouts   a la  Mr  Garlits  I am proud to say that I executed a perfect right hand throttle turn  bringing the rear around smartly and hooking the tires back up to rocket off down the next road When we returned to the Ford dealer  my heart was beginning to settle down  and we had stopped our crazy talk of canceling our order for a new Volvo which at that time was in the works  Summed up  the Mustang GT has a marvelous engine  transmission and brakes in search of a comparable car  because as soon as the ignition was switched off  the uncomfortable seat  creaky dashboard and all the rest were back again the wonderful  machismo  of V 8 s and  quot Big Daddy quot  burnouts simply can t overcome it  and the insurance companies who underwrite it will be happy to tell you the same thing The Mustang GT  It s a beautiful car to drive  but I couldn t imagine living with one br br  
Pos, I have a 80 mile round trip to work each day  which means a lot of wear  amp  tear in a short time  Having  quot been there quot  with front wheel drive and its mechanical weaknesses  this time I wanted low tech and low maintenance  That means good ol  stone age rear wheel drive   Pretty much the reason cops  amp  cabbies prefer Crown Vic s  The Mustang was exactly what I wanted  The V6 and 5 speed make all the power a grown up commuter could ask for  while large  3 8l  for its output  150 HP  the engine makes plenty of low rev torque and will chirp its tires in second gear if asked  All while delivering a comfortable  if heavy  ride  The standard 80 watt stereo with CD sounds excellent  with plenty of clean volume and enough bass for anyone short of a rap fan  One thing to be aware of is that on snow or ice you will IMMEDIATELY be aware that this is a rear drive car  I would gladly have paid extra for the limited slip axle used on the GT s if it was available  If you do a lot of driving in these kind of conditions  you should probably consider another car  With 40000 miles on the car  it s as solid as the day it was made  Nothing has failed  malfunctioned  or broken  It was also equipped with the cleanest brakes I ve ever seen  When they re due for replacement  which won t be for a while yet  I ll actually get the replacements at a Ford dealer   they re that good  The GT wheels that came with the Sport Appearance Package have a durable finish and are blessed by being free of nooks and crannies that make other wheels such a chore to clean  Make sure your car gets to a dealer to have a  quot silent quot  campaign fix  there is a kit available to re route the fuel hoses coming from the charcoal canister  Otherwise the car has a tendency to pass a gasoline odor into the passenger compartment after the car has sloshed its fuel around in stop and go driving  It s a free fix from the factory  Overall  the car is a pleasure br br  
Pos, I have loved mustangs since I was old enough to drive  I finally got one  It was well worth the wait  I have had more fun with this car than any other I ve driven  I bought the car used because I was just not quite ready for a brand new car  Besides  Mustangs always hold their worth  She is small enough that I can move in and out of traffic with ease  yet I am very comfortable when driving  The only downside is the small back seat  Or at least it is a downside to my daughter who has the very long legs  The back seat does not bother me at all in the driver seat  This is a sports car and not a family vehicle  The car will really run too  Not that I am a speed demon or anything  Anyone who wants to have fun driving should get one  If you are a young family with small children  you may want to wait until all the kids are driving themselves  But eventually everyone should experience the fun of a mustang  There is only one thing that I would change about my car  That is the placement of the drink cup holder  It sits directly behind my stick shift and sometimes a drink will get in my way  It needs to be back about 3 inches  Other than that  I have the perfect car     
Pos, I love this car  You get the feel of a sports car  the handling of a sports car  the look of a sports car at a non sports car price  What more could one ask for  Standard on the car comes the one disk cdplayer  a must for anyone these days who listens to music and the sound quality on the base model still out performs most cars  When a person thinks of a two door car the first thing that comes to mind is SPACE  It is not a worry in this car  there is plenty of trunk space for those long trips  a middle console to hold anything from cds to papers and plenty of leg room for front seat passengers  This vehicle with its V 6 engine gets very good gas milage perfect for those who have long commutes to work or who just drive a lot  Speaking of V 6 this engine gives you more bang for your buck even at 80 miles an hour  it feels like 60  the car moves with you gliding along curves and passing the competition  You are in control when driving this car  This vehicle is the perfect car for college students  young professionals  retired persons alike  The only people i do not recommend this car for you people with children because of the obvious lingistics that entails  If you are looking for a car that is just right for you  try a mustang you will NOT be disappointed   
Pos, Ever since high school I ve wanted to own a Mustang GT  I bought it two years ago with about every option imaginable and have been very happy with it overall It is a true sports car which means it was designed to drive fast and handle like a sports car not a cadillac  It s a lot of fun to drive  The seats are somewhat uncomfortable especially for long trips  If you have a bad back this is not a good every day choice for you The 4 6liter V8 packs a pretty good punch  225 horsepower is decent  not quite as fast as the Z28 of the same year but much better looking A few pet peeves the cup holders are ridiculous  there is one huge one which if you put a drink in there   it inevitably falls out on the floor and one smaller one which if you put your drink in it  you can t shift into second or fourth because it s blocked by your drink  don t Ford engineers drive these cars themselves the head rest is set so far back that it might as well not be there at all sunroof was not an option  I had to install myself for an extra 1 000 br br  
Pos, I have the 98 Mustang GT and much prefer the rear end style so I was glad I didn t wait for the 99 to come out  The car over all is a great car and a lot of fun to drive  The only complaint I have had is that the gearbox is very tight compared to other car I have driven which initially was very frustrating The car handles very well and looks exceptionally sharp on the road  If you like to drive on windy roads  I highly recommend the standard VS  automatic for the fun of maneuvering all those curves  Top down or up  this car is a lot of fun to drive over the coast highway and draws a lot of attention  Mileage at 18 25 mpg is certainly acceptable for a high performance car Even adding the luxury of leather seats  a high performance sound system  and 16 inch wheels  the price is well under  30K The down side is lack of comfort in the back seat for passengers and limited trunk space  Headspace is tight especially if you are tall  but over all this is a very sharp car br br  
Pos, First off let me say the Mustang is one fun car to drive  I have read every review of this car  and I have to say that people are buying this car for the wrong reason  If your looking for performance  then buy the GT  Cobra  or Saleen  You cant buy a 6cyl and complain that it doesn t drive like a GT  Example  you wouldn t buy a Jeep without 4x4  Buying this car one has to keep in mind that this car is for fun and speed  It is not for hauling or transporting people long distances  Now with that said  on to my experiences  I recently purchased a 1998 Mustang Gt Convertible  I haven t owned a new car in over 10 years and I was ready  After many discussions with the wife  she recommened the Mustang  I have always thought that is was a cool looking car  but I really knew nothing about it  So the search begins  I got everything I wanted except a manual transmission  I believe that a sports car should have this so you can control the throttle  But I ended up changing my mind and I don t regret my decision at all now I can hold my coffee and drive I own a Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel  Chevy Venture Van so I wanted a play car  The car stock car is very quick  Handling is excellent and road noise with the convertible is minimal  Again if you don t want to hear the road don t buy the Conv  The cockpit is designed perfect for driving this car  Even though it has seats in the back  in my opinion its a two seater  My kis however can fit back there now but the older they get the more cramped it will be  Longer leg people might not like driving this car  I m 6 2  and with the seat all the way back  I just barely make it  So test drive one before you buy  The day we bought it the wife and I were going skiing  The total mileage was around 410 miles  I got awesome gas mileage and we weren t fatigued from driving the car  The sound system is awesome  This is one stock stereo system that is not getting taken out  The upgraded rims and tires are sweet  but will be pricey for replacement  My tires can not be rotated because they are directional tires  but I accept that  If you left this car stock  you would always have a fast sports car for a great price  But if your like me you can modify it to you taste s the mod bug has bitten me On a scale of 1 10 I give this a 9 Have fun  
Pos, I got to choose a new car for my graduation present  I always wanted a Mustang but I never thought my parents would buy one for me  After looking at many types of cars I narrowed my decision down to a Mustang and a Pontiac Grand AM  The Mustang had so many more options compared to the Grand Am  First of all  it comes fully loaded including power locks  power windows  CD player  automatic seats  etc  The price of the two cars were the same  but I would of been a moron to choose the Grand AM because it did not have to same package deal  I took the car off to college with me and found i could get most of my stuff in it because the trunk is pretty big and the back seats fold down  I recently went on a road trip with three other people in the car  I thought it would be miserable for the passengers  To our suprise  the Mustang had plenty of knee room and space to sleep in the back seat I love the storage compartments and the cell phone adaptor I have not had any problems with this car  I m very pleased with my car br br  
Pos, I have had Ford F250 s in both 7 3 and 6 9 diesels  Both have great power and reliability  The 6 9 was a 1985 model with over 300 000 miles on it  The 7 3 is a 1991 model  Both are 4 wheel drive and were used on the farm to pull stock trailers  Both get about the same fuel mileage  which is about 17 mpg highway unloaded  and about 10 12 mpg pulling a 16  loaded stock trailer  Both also have 4 10 rear ends  which I think is a little low  but they sure do pull good  The thing I like about the 91 model is the 5 speed transmission  the 85 is a 4 speed  The bad thing about a 4 speed is they top out at about 75 or 80 mph  the 5 speed tops out at about 95  It has no trouble maintaining about 75 to 80 mph on level ground and slight hills  big hills will of course slow it down  but not to an unacceptable speed  Ford s diesel engine is made by International  the Powerstroke is basically a 7 3 with a turbo and modified injectors  My 91 has about 240 00 miles on the engine and still runs great and will not burn any oil I have been very pleased with both My next truck will probably be a Ford F250 with a Powerstroke br br  
Pos, We purchased a Ford Escort wagon brand new in 1998  It was very economical  and although I was not ready for the  quot Wagon quot  my two kids and a dog were  With soccer  baseball  volleyball and choir practice  I needed a car that I could fill with kids and or equipment and still save money on gas  This car gets great gas milage  I have safety locks on the back doors so the kids cant roll out into the street and a pull over shade  to hide anything in the hatch from the sun or would be theifs  I have yet to have a breakdown except when I ran out of gas LOL  and other than a problem with the ghost in the dome light  this has been a great family car  I did have the dome light replaced  only to continue having the problem of it coming on sporatically  Now I have it turned off entirely  With that one problem  I feel I am doing pretty well  this car has been a wonderful car for a family that couldnt afford a luxury car  The ride is smooth and seating is plenty  Good mid income family value br br  
Pos, The 1997 Ford Escort is highly reliable  but somewhat less impressive to be seen in than its distant cousin  the Mustang The compact has a very small turning radius  which  in city driving  is crucial  Another benefit for city drivers is the way the Escort holds its alignment  After 1 1 2 years of driving the pothole laced Monroe Ave  in Rochester  NY  and discovering many of the previously mentioned potholes  I have yet to need an alignment  The Escort s sturdy frame is a surprise  but this 4 banger s pep keeps pace with that surprise  Its speed  however  does not keep pace with radar or NY State Troopers  police band radios  Caution is needed for the heavy footed  unless you opt for the cruise control feature The trunk  likewise  is surprisingly roomy  with enough room to pack for a weekend getaway with a clotheshorse spouse and an infant s accessories  The trunk is also accessible through the fold down rear seat  which gives much needed added room when bringing 2X4 s home from the hardware store On the down side  the driver s seat is just enough off center to help your chiropractor keep up the payments on his timeshare  Additionally  the headlights tend to go out a little too often The Escort  though  is sweet on gas  scoring nearly 30 MPG in stop and go driving  And  with its front wheel drive  it s an economical option to SUV s for winter driving br br  
Pos, The precursor to the highly touted Ford Focus  the Escort is a small  economical car  My 1997 Escort is a 4DR with a small engine but can really crank out the gas mileage  Even today  with 50 000 miles I average around 29 30 miles a gallon  I have relied on this car for two years to drive me 5 hours to college and make multiple road trips The only problems I have encountered in 2 years of used car ownership have been minor electrical problems with the dome light and trunk light  I also needed to buy a special CD player installation kit from Circuit City when I put in sound system  However  even the base speakers pack a punch in a little body The best part about my model is that the back seats fold down  creating a massive amount of trunk space  and wide enough area to fit long objects  like my hockey sticks  If your concern is that it appears to be a weak   grocery getter  rest assured the designers did a good job creating a trendy  smooth look  The 4DR models with a spoiler and moon roof and the 2DR ZX2 are also very stylish The 1997 Escort is the perfect first or second car for young drivers and a reliable auto for anyone  
Pos, I really enjoy my little red 1997 Ford Escort  The size seems just about perfect for easy handling  for one thing  Also  the heater works very well to warm the car up fairly quickly on a cold day  faster than my mother s Taurus  My aunt actually picked this car out for me as it was a moderately priced used vehicle  bought May 98 for  10 000  The only things I don t like about it are minor  I don t like the cup holders  anything larger than a  small  can tips over when you turn sharply  also  the gear shift will smash larger cups when you put the car in park  The horn also seems to require a lot of pressure to get it to honk  It has a nice rear window defrost  I also enjoy the remote control trunk and the foldable back seats  Driving is very pleasant  the car is comfortable and responds well  The model I own is a 4 door  perfect for my family of 4  Anyone who likes a maneuverable  comfortable small car should buy it  I suppose those with large families or hauling needs shouldn t  
Pos, My wife and I live paycheck to paycheck just like most of the World does and our current car was falling apart quick  So when we decided that that we needed a new car we sat down and talked about what we wanted  With a tight budget we knew our choices were limited  All I wanted was an american car with a tape deck  She wanted a car with four doors  since we had a 1 year old and one more on the way  and an air conditioner since we lived in Georgia at the time  I was very stern about buying american because that s what keeps out country running and I feel that every time you buy something foreign an american worker loses his job  So we checked out the dealerships for Chevrolet  Dodge  GMC  Saturn  Ford  Jeep and many others  We looked all around looking for the cheapest and the best car we could find  Once we looked at the escort we knew that s what we wanted  It had everything we needed  Four doors for easy access to the loading and unloading of kids  an air conditioner and a tape deck for me  The interior and exterior are holding up pretty good after 4 years but nothing is child proof  The engine is still in good condition after 50 000 miles in 4 years  routine maintenance conducted regularly  but the leg room leaves something to be desired  Granted the leg room isn t anything like a Geo Metro or a ford festiva where your knees are in your chest  You have enough room to move around and not get cramps but i wouldn t try stretching out to much br br  
Pos, I surprised myself when I ended up buying a used 97 Escort last year  I was in the market for a new used car  but I had sworn to myself and my dad that I wouldn t get an escort  We had an 88 or 89 when I was a kid and it was one of the most atrociously ugly cars I ve ever seen  It looked like a small happy meal box on wheels  or maybe just a tanks  Well  to get to the point One afternooon I was at a used car dealership and saw a silver 97 Escort in my price range  The main reason I chose to test drive it  aside from it being silver my favorite car color  was to get my dad to stop bugging me about one  Miraculously  I realized it was a great car while I was driving it  It has decent pickup for a car in its class and has wonderful handling  I bought it that very afternoon I m still very happy with my purchase  though I ve had a few small problems with it since I bought it  The service engine light came on repeatedly the first couple of months and then we found out the light itself had gone bad  I recently had the check coolant light come on from time to time  but that stopped once I had the radiator serviced Overall  it is a great car for someone who doesn t have a lot of money to spend on a car  but wants something sort of nice that handles well Oh  and the title of this review is  quot Hillary quot  because I have a  quot Hillary for Senate quot  bumpersticker on my Escort  and it seems to be its new name br br  
Pos, You love your wife  but sometimes she eats too much I love my 1996 Ford Explorer XLT  It is nice  attractive  strong and quiet  I bought this car to have my family in a secure vehicle when on road  Before buying this car I tested similar SUVs such as Toyota 4Runner  Nissan Pathfinder  Chevrolet Blazer and Mitsubishi Montero The Explorer comes loaded with a bunch of features you will not easily find on other SUV  I love the knob activated four wheel drive that allows me to turn it on at any time or any speed without stopping the car  This is useful when it starts raining and you want your tires to stick to the pavement  The engine is powerful enough to handle the truck  but may be a little less responsive in short accelerations  I corrected this problem with the installation of a PowerJet  150 There is not other SUV that offers the comfort  luxury and beauty of a Ford Explorer  This is a car to fall in love  Everything is powered  the back seat radio and air conditioning console is definitely a plus Mileage is definitely an issue  The Explorer eats too much  My average consumption improved a little after I installed the PowerJet The ride inside the Explorer is quiet  soft and smooth  You can barely hear the motor or the transmission  It took me a while to know how to handle it  It drives amazingly well in straight roads even at 90mph  but you have to be careful when cornering I had a transmission problem during the warranty period  sort of a solenoid was replaced  Few months later they replaced the gas pump solenoid too I recommend this truck to any family that wants comfort security and adventure  The Explorer is great for long trips and its cargo area fits more stuff than you could imagine  Believe me  my wife brings the whole house into the car when we go on vacation  My wife loves the sense of security this car provides and she can handle it easily Recently I decided to sell my Explorer and went looking for another SUV with better mileage  None of the year 2000 models I saw  could barely compare in features to my Explorer  I still keep it  it is a vehicle you want forever  just like a wife even if she eats too much br br  
Pos, The ford explorer is a very tricky car  when i first bought it  it was as if it was a dream  it drives like no other  and its very comfortable  but after a few months of driving  it began breaking down  and loosing parts very fast  not only did it stall all the time  and had to change light bulbs  batteries etc  the cost became very great  since i was having to fix it all the time  it got expensive  the parts where also expensive  the car is a very safe car  but you cannot take corners fast  it topples over easily  it is a very top heavy car  it has room  and has a big engine  it handles nice in the snow  over all i give it a three out of five stars   
Pos, If you Love Quality  and You Love Comfort  This is the Vehicle for you It s not only sporty but it has many luxuries to go along with it I don t personally own this vehicle  but I had it for about a month  It was my bosses  I used to have to drive him around and things like that  The particular Explorer that he had was a 1996 with the Eddie Bauer package  What a nice truck  It had leather interior  4 WD  the handling of it was excellent  I d driven through some snowy messes that I know I would have never made it through with my car  and that truck just went through it like it was nothing  This truck also got great gas milage  I can t really give exact numbers right now  I don t remember  But I do know that for the amount of driving that I had done  it didn t take as much gas as I had thought it would  No different than what my car takes  It handles well on the highway  or over rugged mountain roads  Either way you go  you have great control  Another feature I liked about this truck was the fact that it told you in digital numbers what the temperature was outside  what direction you were going and everything  It tells you how soon you need to refuel  when you need your next oil change etc  For instance say you put in 20 gallons of gasoline  You drive a little while and look at the meter  it will tell you that you have 15 gallons left  Great idea Ford  I like that  Power windows  power locks  combination lock on the door  if you forget your key  All great features of this wonderful truck  As for cons  I never found any  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a sporty vehicle  but yet solid  safe and sound  If you don t know if you d want to own one  just go test drive one someday  You ll see what I m talking about br br  
Pos, I own a 1996 Ford Explorer with leather interior and all the options  It is a classy looking SUV that is luxurious to drive  It has smooth handling and and has been very reliable  Cornering is ok but sometimes tippy on very sharp turns  Four wheel drive is excellent for winter conditions  especially slippery stop and goes I would not recommend this vehicle for someone who is planning to drive on rough terrain  It is very bumpy on rough roads and is better for road driving People who should buy this vehicle are small families  individuals who are worried about driving in winter conditions  and anyone who camps or participates in outdoor activities such as skiing or biking Overall  this is a great vehicle to own because it is a nice ride  is asthetically pleasing  is good in winter conditions  and has luxurious options   
Pos, After buying and driving small cars  Hondas  Saturns  even an MG for the past twenty years I was uncertain about going the SUV route  But  as my interests now require me to have more room for hauling around equipment  I scuba dive I needed a vehicle that had more room The Explorer has all the room one needs yet also has the  quot car quot  feel I was so afraid to lose  As I also commute over 100 miles per day to work this vehicle has gotten a rigorous workout  100 000 miles in three years  and has not given me a single headache It truly is a utility vehicle  it has the class and looks for going to a formal wedding yet makes itself right at home at the camp ground  I am not a rugged individual  actually a short 40 year old woman  this vehicle has not only changed the way I feel about SUV s and trucks in general I will most certainly purchase another SUV  and probably another Explorer  when the time to trade in come around  But after over 100 000 miles the car looks and drives like new  so that may not be for quite sometime br br  
Pos, Puschased used with 60 000 miles  This is an XLT model and is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned  In the 1st 6 months  I have driven about 10 000 miles and have had no problems  I have had to replace 2 tail light bulbs and the battery  Regular service has included power stearing fluid change  Transmission fluid change  radiator cleaned and flushed and 2 wiper blades in addition to regular oil changes with Mobil 1 5W30 motor oil  Excellent The remote outside mirrors leave no blind spots when properly adjusted  Handling is excellent  stearing is responsive and predictable  It is one of the smoothest riding vehicles I have ever owned  Twice in this time I have moved 400 and 900 miles and found the cargo capacity excellent  Even fully loaded  the handling is smooth  I like the option of opening the rear glass or the whole tailgate  The seats are cloth and very comfortable  This vehicle has power seats with lumbar and calf support which allows very comfortable adjustments  In my opinion this is an excellent choice for anyone who needs the ability to haul children and or stuff  Front Rear seating is ample and comfortable  Head and leg room superior to most I have driven  Gas mileage is good  Wind noise above 60 mph moderate Would recommend this SUV highly  Since it has dual air bags  small children should only ride in the back seat  Auto 4 Wheel drive excellent for rail snow ice br br  
Pos, In 1996 I needed a new vehicle and since I already owned an 92 explorer I decided to go and see what more it had to offer quot OH MY GOD quot  was I shocked  quot THIS EXPLORER IS AWESOME quot  I fell deeply in love with something that is not human I had to take it for a test drive well I did and I paid cash on the spot  I couldn t believe how nice this vehicle is and to this day I will not give up this vehicle As a matter of fact I m in the market for a new one now  and I just can t wait but I have to at least one more week I m here to tell you that the ride and the feeling of being behind the wheel is such an experience that you will want to cherish forever and you ll try to keep it to yourself but you just can t do it  because once you drive it you just want to keep on going forever and you ll have to tell someone your awesome experience quot that you will never forget quot sooner than later The EXPLORER has everything that I could ever dream of having in a car such as cd player air cruse the best ride I ve found yet smooth when you want it fast when needed easy visuals and in dash equipment and much much much much more I ll tell you this quot if you like feeling in control or like going offroad or just taking a sunday ride  or going shopping in comfort style and knowing you ll be fine in the snow and be seen in awwwwed then this is the ride for you     
Pos, I had a 96 Ford Explorer with all of the toys  I really enjoyed this vehicle  However  it does have its faults  It s towing capability isn t good  the in line 6 doesn t have enough power  I know your saying why didn t you get the V8  I ll tell you  To get an Explorer with a V8 I lose the option of 2WD  If Ford would have not went to AWD with the V8 I would have gotten it  It s offroad capabilty it s great either  Low ground clearance and poor shocks are 2 faults So If your looking for a sport utility to drive like a car and get car like gas mileage get an Explorer  If you want a SUV to kick some butt  I d look at a Durango  I have a Durango now br br  
Pos, Well what to say about the ford explorer limited besides that it is GREAT  I recently bought a 1996 ford explorer limited with 54 000 miles for  14 000  Which I consider a very good price considering that Kelly Blue Book value is  20 000  www kellybluebook com Since the limited is top of the line  the interior is luxurious and comfortable  There is an electronic control center that gives me such information as gas usage and oil information as well as much other useful info  I bought this explorer for it s handsome looks  widespread popularity  and size  It does what I want when I want it to  I also like how my passengers in the back receive rear air  an option in XLT and up  Also the windows in the back go farther down than a Chevy Tahoe  The explorer is capabale of off roading  I know so because I have gone off roading  it is not the best but does what any soccer mom sport utility is capable of  The running boards hit A LOT of times when heading off the trail  So if y ou plan on off roading  then do not get them  Also the factory running boards are narrow and hard to use  I do not recommend them  An aftermarket supplier can supply great ones  Now let s hear about the cons  THE ENGINE  I would definetly go with the V8 In 1996 the V8 was not available so I have a 4 0 V6 with 160 horsepower  My wifes 1999 Ford Taurus SE has a 200 horsepower V6  Also  some of the interior is plastic feeling and kinda cheap looking  I have had no problems and my carfax report was 100  clear  I definetly recommend this versatile sport utility to anyone with the need for it or for anyone who wants some comfortable driving br br  
Pos, With  2500 in Ford Citibank dollars to apply toward the purchase of my 1996 Eddie Bauer 4x2 Explorer  it was hard to choose another SUV  However  I test drove all the rest  At that time  the Chevy Blazer had the smoothest ride  but the inside had too much plastic  The Toyota 4Runner was hot  but close to  6 000 more than a comparably equipped Explorer  Also  I discovered that the insurance on a 4Runner was  600 year higher  After 45 000 miles  my Explorer has operated with zero defects  Other than changing the oil every three thousand miles  and one thorough servicing  250  at 30 000 miles  I haven t spent a dime maintaining this truck  The paint has held up to the abuses of street parking in Los Angeles and San Francisco  The ride is a bit rough for those looking for more of a car than a truck  If I had to do it over  I would have waited until 1997 to get the larger V6  The 160hp V6 in my Explorer is pretty weak and a 190hp V6 was offered in 1997  Other than that  the interior is extremely comfortable  The Eddie Bauer package includes power  leather seats with power lumbar support   an excellent feature for long drives  This is a solid truck that is proving to be a great value br br  
Pos, I bought my Explorer for basically one main reason  More Space  I had previously owned a 1995 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP 2 door and its small back seat was cramping for my large dog  Max   He now has plenty of windows to look out and tons of room to move around as he desires  It s also nice being able to go to Sam s Club and fit everything I  my mother    my sister purchase into one car  This SUV has outweighed my expectations  It heats up quickly in freezing weather  has minimal maintenance problems  and smooth ride  This vehicle fits into my life well I am very much amazed at the reliability of my Explorer  I bought my 1996 Ford Explorer used in September  2001 with 120 000 miles on it  and two days ago it hit 130 000  I was amazed to have gone 10 000 miles without a single problem except for nails in my tire  Those 10 000 miles weren t easy either  mostly driving through downtown Chicago s bumpy streets on my way to college  This vehicle also has plenty of room for all necessary activities  Shopping  Clothes   Groceries  nights out in downtown Chicago  carting around my 80 Lb Chocolate Laborador  helping friends move  driving to school  camping  etc  etc  This vehicle s looks are stylish and rugged at the same time and perfect for any occasion  My ONLY complaint with this vehicle is its horrible gas consumption  I drive approximately 200 miles a week  City   Suburb  and have to fill the 17 Gallon tank up each week  All of the Ford Explorer s amenities outweigh this one drawback  and make me feel completely satisfied with this purchase  
Pos, I replaced my totaled Ramcharger with a 1995 Bronco XLT  I looked around carefully   read my review entitled  quot Before you talk turkey  inspect the bird quot    I found what has been a gem The truck had high mileage for a 2 year old machine  but that did not seem a problem  A check on the previous owner  and contact with him  confirmed that the truck had been used for a 60 mile commute  all highway driving This Bronco has all the amenities you think you are driving around in a four wheel drive Lincoln  All the power accessories bothered me  they tend to break  So far  after 2 1 2 years  none have  I ve put over 100 000 miles on the vehicle since buying it it has the overdrive automatic transmission  so at 65 miles per hour  the engine is running at under 2000 RPM and can get up to 19 5 MPG if I leave the cruise control on  32x1150 tires  The overall average is about 16 5   I do a lot of highway driving I noted in another review by a mechanic comments about the cost of repairs in the areas of ball joints and exhaust systems  He s right   if you need exhaust headers replaced in a late model Bronco  it s a major job  You can get ball joints with lube points  so if you replace the original set with these  then keep them lubed  they will last a long time  By the way when you have ball joints done  have the front axle u joints replaced while the whole thing is apart The other aspect of front suspension component wear are the twin I beam control arms  The key things that get loose are the large control arm bushings that stabilize the rear of the arms  These arms in turn stabilize the twin I beam front axle system  The right side is the most likely to have problems   it s close to exhaust system components  and there are heat shielding bushing collars that protect the rubber part of the bushings  Over time  the right side rubber bushing can get mushy from heat exposure  Just keep an eye on it Another thing to think about   this applies to Broncos with serpentine belts  and any other vehicle so equipped    periodically check the belt  and remove it to make sure that the things it turns are without bearing or bushing noise and shaft play  Make sure the idler and tension pulley bushings are good  If something freezes up  you are SOL  Carry a spare serpentine belt if you travel in remote areas The key to owning a Bronco  and really  any other vehicle  is in the maintenance program  Since in some areas  there s more to an SUV than a regular vehicle  there are added maintenance points that need to be attended to One of the things that you must do is to periodically lock the hubs and drive a while  If your Bronco is equipped with the auto locking hubs  you cannot do this unless in four wheel drive  so you have to be off road  The auto locking hubs are a nice convenience   but one of the first things I did was to replace them with Warn manual locking hubs  The auto locking hubs can result in too little exercise for the front axle u joints  Once these joints start getting twitchy from lack of exercise  they can cause the auto hubs to lock falsely  The off road performance of the Bronco is good  It has gone everywhere I wanted to go with no complaints or difficulties  By the way   if you are one of those who likes  quot mudding quot    remember that that mud gets into things and can reduce longevity unless properly cleaned out This is another truck that the manufacturer has discontinued in favor of fancier  more expensive rigs aimed at the yuppie market  It s a shame   it s a good truck  1996 was the last model year if you are looking for a strong machine that still has some  not all  of the simplicity of the basic pickup truck  the Bronco can serve you well br br  
Pos, We originally bought the Bronco because it suited our family needs  The wife and I have 2 growing boys and 2 dogs  The Bronco is a great vehicle to comfortably haul the whole crew around It is also surprisingly easy to drive  with power everything  the size of the vehicle is generally not an issue  We love the easy viewing from on high and the basic ruggedness The Bronco even makes a nice cross country traveler  getting about 17 miles to the gallon on the highway Unfortunately  the in town mileage tends to hover around 10 mpg  It is a thirsty beast The quality of the vehicle was generally good  but we did have one major complaint  Before the 15 000 mile mark  we replaced the front brake rotors and calipers because they had warped  This caused an annoying pulsing sensation when braking  We took it to Ford several times  where they would turn the rotors only to have them warp again within the next 1000 miles or so  After 3 trips to Ford  we went to aftermarket components  Sperry  which cured the problem and actually provided better feel than stock  Cost was  450 00 The Bronco is a vehicle that gives a lot of satisfaction  but is not necessarily going to be cheap to feed or maintain  We would recommend it to folks who really need a rugged  powerful SUV and are willing to pay for it br br

Pos, Due to a combination of circumstances with which I will not bore my busy audience  it was recently necessary that I make a trip from Boston  MA to Atlanta  GA and back  a journey of some 1000 odd miles each way  Due to the amount of luggage that needed to make the trip as well  flying was prohibitively expensive  and due to that same quantity of luggage none of the cars owned by the four parties involved were large enough  so the decision was made to rent a minivan  The automobile chosen was the 2001 Ford Windstar  and having now spent a total of 34  hours driving and riding in the vehicle through sun  rain and fog at all hours of the day and night  I have prepared a brief sketch detailing my thoughts  After all  I might as well have something to show for my absence from epinions  right As a passenger I must first note that I found the rear seats  which are pretty comfortable for basic sitting  a little firm  but not unpleasantly so  to be almost impossible to sleep on  Since we were taking turns with the driving and going straight through a 14 hour trip after not having slept a whole lot the night before  this distance is from CT to Atlanta we rested after the three hour trip from Boston to CT  it would have been very helpful if the drivers to be could have gotten some sleep while waiting for their shifts  but this was extremely difficult  This is partly due to the fact that the back seats are bucket seats and are placed about six inches away from the inside wall of the car normally I like to lean against the door with a pillow to sleep in a vehicle  but this was impossible in the Windstar  This may seem minor  but I considered it a serious flaw due to the situation  on the return trip we left at 9 30 pm and drove all night  so comfortable seats for sleeping would definitely have been helpful For those who do not anticipate spending a lot of time sleeping in the back seat this may not be much of an issue  but if you are ever considering renting one for a trip  as we did  I would say that this factor definitely warrants consideration as all four of us had a lot of trouble getting any rest while on the road  The front seat  which is set against the door in the usual manner  was a little better for sleeping  but it still proved hard to find a good position  The firm seats don t really yield well to any position other than sitting upright  so any sort of slouching or leaning in an attempt to nod off is not welcomed by the car I should note that the vehicle has a removable second back seat which is a bench seat we rented it without this to leave more room for the cargo  but that one may well be more comfortable for napping than the two rear bucket seats we had The front seats are easily adjustable to a wide range of angles handy since three people of varying heights were taking turns at driving and the rear seats recline pretty far back  although  not to belabor a point  this somehow did not prove helpful when it came to sleeping As a passenger in the back seat I also noticed that it swayed quite a bit in the rear  I could often feel it lurching a little from side to side due to wind  swerves  etc  but this was barely noticeable in the front seats and did not seem to affect the vehicle s handling I drove the Windstar for the most part on highways  The little city driving I did was unremarkable I mostly noticed that I was more uncomfortable with the vehicle in town because with more other cars closer to me the size of it became more noticeable and I am not used to driving a large car  but it handled smoothly and braked well  I am always interested in brakes  and since I managed not to sideswipe anyone I consider the adventure a success Out on the highway it took a little while to get up to cruising speed  probably about average pickup for a large vehicle  although I don t have much to compare it with  and lost a little speed when going up hills  but when cruising on a flat road it performed admirably  There was no noticeable difference in feel between 50 and 80 mph  and occasionally and briefly up to 95  the ride stayed smooth and the noise level  it was always a little loud  but conversation was still possible between front and back seats with a little raising of the voice  remained the same  This was sometimes a bit of a problem when I would glance down and notice that I was going 85 without meaning to  but once I learned to keep a close eye on the speedometer I could only admire the smooth way it handled high speeds  It is also equipped with cruise control  so if you like to use it this would also have solved that problem Personally I prefer to moderate speed manually  but I also prefer standard transmission  just a control freak  I guess  The Windstar  of course  is an automatic  and I can report that transmission was smooth and quiet It does take rather wide turns  and turning feels a little tricky at high speeds  but then  no matter what you re driving you should be careful around turns at 80 mph  but otherwise the handling at highway speeds was very nice  I did find that I had a tendency to drift a little to the right  although this may be my own fault rather than anything to do with the car  and there is a marked blind spot on the right side  but the car was always responsive and I never felt in danger of losing control This remained true even in pouring rain  Aside from sometimes speeding like a maniac  I am a cautious driver and tend to be wary of wet roads  but I felt firmly in control of the Windstar  after reducing speed a little to about 60 mph  even in the middle of a downpour Changing lanes was a little nerve wracking at first when moving to the left since the side of the vehicle is so long  but once you get used to it there should be no problem  Likewise  backing up was a challenge since I wasn t used to looking through such a long interior to the rear window  and parking was interesting  but these are all issues that would quickly be resolved if I had time to get really accustomed to driving a larger vehicle We had to refuel 6 times during the trip  including once to fill the tank before returning the car to the rental agency  We spent about  25 30 each time  and concluded that we got decent gas mileage for a large vehicle Cargo space  without the third row of seats  was pretty much exactly adequate for our needs  We were carrying two large cardboard boxes  five backpack sized bags of personal effects  several smaller bags of snacks and odds and ends  a video camera  a microphone case  a couple of poster tubes and some lumber  This filled up all the space with little room left over  but did not take up enough room to interfere with vision through the rear window  I would estimate that the size would be adequate for most general moving needs There are also many nice little nooks and crannies to store things elsewhere in the van  including little cubbies between both front and rear seats  a CD holder up front  a coin holder on the ceiling  etc  The cup holders in front were a little flimsy looking  but did the job  Cup holders in back were more solid and were a nice touch since we jointly consumed about 30 bottles of water and soda on the journey  We were also entertained by a little fold out mirror that allows people in the front to keep an eye on the back seats  We didn t have a whole lot of use for it  but it would probably be handy for those with lively  squirming children I should mention that this vehicle has a sliding door on each side providing access to the back seats  rather than the usual right side only door  This is a major selling point for Ford  I think  and I can report that it was indeed very handy not to have anyone having to climb over seats to get inside  We also liked the fact that the child safety lock feature  which prevents the side doors from being opened from the inside  was easy to turn off  just flip a lever on the edge of the sliding door once it s open The controls were fairly standard  lights on a dial  turn signal and windshield wipers on a lever on the steering column  emergency brake below  etc  The gear shift is on the steering column  which some people like and some don t  Personally I don t have a strong preference either way as long as it gets the job done  which this did There were no aspects of the controls that we found to be odd or hard to get used to in the short time we were driving the vehicle We had slight problems with the temperature  but only because I am always cold and everyone else in the car was always hot  Mechanically  the climate control worked just fine  There is even a separate control dial to give a different temperature for the back than the front  We didn t really do a stringent test of this function  since everyone but me was agreed on a cool temperature  but at one point we did try warming the back for those people trying to sleep while keeping the front cool to maintain alertness in the driver  and it seemed to work I obviously cannot speak to any issues that might arise as the vehicle gets to be a few years older  We had no mechanical problems  but it would have been surprising if we had  since the car was practically brand new and rented to boot  and there could be age related problems down the line that we will never know about I cannot give a recommendation on whether to buy or not buy based on my experience  but I can offer advice to anyone considering renting a vehicle to haul a bunch of stuff or several people  That advice would be  go for it if you re not planning to need sleep  but if you re going to be in it for the long haul I would seriously suggest looking for something with more comfortable seats  I would give the Windstar 4 stars in general for speediness  control  carrying capacity and gas mileage  but due to the unpleasant experience with the seats I can only give it three  Again  this may seem a small issue  but all four of us agreed that the inability to sleep in the seats was a problem on the long drive  and I personally would think twice before renting another Windstar for any extensive trip Otherwise  I have no fault to find with the vehicle  which performed admirably in the few days we had it And since I can think of no more to say  here ends my song of the rented Windstar  
Pos, Since our family has multiplied from 2 to 3  we knew it was time to drive a car that could carry all of our stuff  So out we went test driving everything under the sun until we came across a bright red Ford Windstar 2001 minivan  I do mean Bright RED  At first I was not crazy about the color  but since we live in a town with a bunch of crazy drivers  at least they can t miss us pulling out It was a cold yucky day  So when we popped into this vehicle the sales guy gave us the key and started the engine  While we were sitting in the parking lot the van quickly got warm This was a good sign  The front and the back are on two different temperature controls  The front passengers can decide the temperature for the whole crew or give the control to whoever is sitting in the back The seats are incredible  After owning a Jetta VW and Mazda 626 for what seems like forever  we love these seats  We can t wait for our next big trip from South Carolina to Ohio or Florida  My friend just bought a Ford Explorer and after her last long trip she is ready to trade it in and get a Windstar  She loves to ride in it  and so do all of the neighborhood kids I still can t get over how roomy this minivan is  When you are in the vehicle you feel like you can stretch out and really enjoy the ride  If you need to  you or your passenger can pop into the back without getting out of the vehicle  Of course after the vehicle has come to a full and complete stop  This helps on big trips  But if and when you need to get out the interior lights can be switched to the sleeping baby mode so that only the floor lights will light up As far as removing seats  My husband does that  He says that they are heavy and we are not quite sure where we would store them if we have to remove them while we were away from home  That is why the Mazda MVP is better in that department  Their back seat folds into the bottom of the floor board  That is a nice feature that I hope becomes a standard next on all minivans  Two doors  Need I say more  I am not quite sure how  without getting into the minivan  I would buckle in 2 children with only 1 door If you are ready to plunge into the family minivan make sure you get a minivan with at least these options 1  Power windows for the front and the back  So on hot days you can open the back windows to let the hot air escape and close to keep in the air conditioning 2  Dark tinted windows to keep some of hot sun out and children s goofy offending faces in 3  Two control panels for the temperature controls  One for the front and one for the back  You the driver will always have the main control 4  Try to get a light as possible colored car if you live like us in the south  The darker the car the faster it will heat up in the hot  hot sun 5  Test drive as many cars as you can stand  Take your time and remember to have your vehicle checked by a good mechanic  There are a lot of lemons out there and you have to be careful with whatever car you purchase  
Pos, I recently purchased a 2003 Ford ZX2 and even though I have only had the vehicle for about a month I am very happy with its performance The reason for choosing this vehicle was after my wife had read the consumer report on the vehicle we felt that safety was an important feature and this car seemed to be just that  The car has a very sporty look to it and the size is just right for a smaller family  The price also was very reasonable and with the trade in on my Grand Am and the cash bonus my final price was just under  10 000 00 In this day of high gas prices this was another reason for my choice  My ZX2 is a 4 cylinder  but I was very surprised with the power it still has  Going up hill does not seem to be a problem for this car and the smooth ride for the size is just right for me  After checking gas mileage around town I am averaging about 26 miles to the gallon  I live in an area with many hills and with that type of mileage I was very pleased  As far as the safety I spoke of earlier the vehicle seems to be built very solid and that was very important to me  If you are like me you read all you can on something before you spend a numerous amount of money  so even though I have only had this vehicle a month I am very pleased to say I am happy with my purchase  
Pos, It finally arrived  I waited nine months for Ford to fill my order for a 2002 T bird  It was love at first sight  and at first drive I m someone who does not know a lot about mechanics  but is impressed by detail and design  The 2002 T bird is obviously a car engineered with passion  From the powerful motor and firm suspension right down to the chrome trimmed cup holders  this is a car that exudes style and quality This car drives nearly silent with the optional hard top on  Take the hard top off and it is still very quiet inside  even at highway speeds  Conversation is easy  though the fantastic Bose stereo system with CD changer may have you cranking up the tunes  Ford makes a big point of saying that this car is a  cruiser  and not intended to be a Porshe like sports car  It s a car to drive around town in and a car to enjoy a road trip  What is surprising is that the tight suspension and responsive V 8 do give the driver a real thrill  It s all the performance I could possibly use in a car  and I m not gentle with the gas when I drive a car If you are worried about room inside  don t be  I m 6 1  and the car is comfortable and fun  with or without the hard top on  It is even more fun without the top  of course  This really is a two seater  though  It s a good size car  so many people assume that there must be a small seat or shelf hidden back there  There is not  The trunk is surprisingly spacious  I haven t put my clubs in it yet  but I don t anticipate a problem  My father  who owned one of the  57s that inspired the 2002  recently told me   Everyone should own a car like this once in their life  It s true  This car is a thing of beauty  A bit of advice  California dealers were marking up the T birds  10 000 15 000  depending on the color  So  I ordered mine from a Florida dealer  had them ship it to me  and paid very close to sticker  If you really want this car  be patient  They all get built at the same factory  so check around the country for the dealer willing to give you the best price October update to this review  I ve got a couple of thousand miles on the T bird now really driven this car  It s better than ever  No regrets on this purchase  Though the trunk is small  I regularly cart around two sets of golf clubs  I ve driven the car three hundred miles in a single day and found it comfortable  The sound system is just amazing  Now that it is  broken in  it sounds just fantastic  I actually prefer listening to CDs in the car  rather than my home theater system  Lessons learned  carry sunscreen in the car and a leather jacket in the trunk and it s almost never necessary to put up the top  Now that the engine has a few thousand miles on it  I drive the car more aggressively  Wow  what a blast  This thing hauls  The low center of gravity and wide tires also makes for nice cornering  What is really interesting is how people react to this piece of new Americana  Older folks remember the 50 s T birds and are happy to see  it s back  The younger skateboarding crowd often yell  cool car  when I drive by and I wonder if they even know that this car is based on a 1950s style  Six months after my purchase  I still strongly recommend this vehicle  My advice remains the same  though  Don t pay a big mark up on the vehicle  They are out there and you can ship a car across country for a couple hundred bucks  I had mine built at Ford from and order placed by a Florida dealer and then shipped to a fleet center in Dublin  California  I never met the salesman I bought the car from  but then again I didn t pay the  6 000 mark up my local dealer wanted to charge me  Be patient  This car is worth waiting for  
Pos, My husband loves Jaguars  He has a current lease on an S type  has been to tour their factories in England  and has numerable collectables and trinkets adorning our home  tantamount to his love of this legendary car  So why am I writing about a Ford Escape  Because it took a will and determination equal to his passion to convince him NOT to renew his lease on another Jaguar  OK  all you fellow jag nuts can come assassinate me now  but at least hear me out first  Our S type was riddled with problems  and has had no less than THREE major  147hospital 148 visits in the two years it has lived with us  and this does not count the time I had a teeny tiny little scrape up  and had to have the rear bumper replaced 133oops  Nor does this count the numerous times we had to take it in for minor repairs  I wont go into detail of our woes now  that will be for another review  but suffice it to say  I was ready for something with a little more reliability  So  we set off on a quest for a car that fit our bill of needs  sporty  stylish  a luxurious feel  and  not at all in the least  coverage by Ford 146s A plan  aah  yes  the limiting factor  And so we ended up at the Ford Escape b The Car  My new Escape is a brand new 2003  4WD Limited model  with BOTH available options of the power moonroof and the trailer towing package  This model Escape comes complete with a 4 liter  V6 engine  I chose the silver color  more on my husband 146s insistance than anything else  I would have preferred black  for a sleeker look  The interior is black leather b Appearance  I  Outside   The Escape is not an ugly small SUV  but its overall outward appearance is rather boxy by my standards  This is compounded by the lack of plastic  147fenders 148 on the Limited model  which are a distinguishing identifier of the XLT and XLS models  Apparantly Ford thinks that a monotone body looks more stylish and  147upperclass 148  but I think the black edging gives the bottom of the car a finished look  I don 146t know how this will translate into long term preservation of the car 146s finish  but I expect the bottom of the car may show more dings and scratches  and be more prone to rust  In addition  all Escapes have a rather high  square  hind end  This adds to the boxy appearance  but does mean more storage space in the cargo area  so it is an equitable trade off    Inside   The inside of the Limited Escape has a much more luxurious feel than the outside  It feels quite roomy  and the front passenger seating area seems to have as much space as the larger Explorer  The black leather seats are quite nice  both looks wise and in comfort  The simulated leather trim on the dash  however  does not uphold the luxury car appearance  It is too grainy  and puckered in some places  I don 146t know what would have worked better  since real leather or wood probably would have put the car outside of its price class  perhaps a simulated wood could have done the trick  The driver controls panel is somewhat stylish by day  the round  white windows look rather futuristic  but the effect is ruined at night  Rather than continuing to glow their opalescent white  they turn black  with illuminated dials and numbers in the oh so christmasy green and red  Personally  I think the white  147glow bug 148 look is much nicer  and some neon blue dials would have completed the look nicely  The  piece de resistance   of the dash area is the silver temperature audio console  It contrasts nicely with the black surface covering  and greatly adds to the  147luxury 148 feel of the car  This takes up most of the middle area of the front dash  and is complete with 6 CD in dash changer  tuner  air temperature controls and vents  and storage pockets  some of which seem more useful than others The backseat and cargo areas are also quite nice  The pockets on the back of the front seats look to be quite useful for children 146s accessories  and the rear seat headrests are a nice  and not often seen feature  The cargo area is roomy  with plenty of headspace for tall objects  There is also a stylish roll up style cover  which can be pulled over low lying objects for privacy  This can be rolled up when not in use  and even removed entirely The entire interior has a uniform feel  with its black leather seating and dash surfaces  and black plush carpeting covering the floors  mats  cargo area  and front face of rear seats  and the tinted windows and moonroof complete the mood lit effect of being in a dark car b Functionality  I Comfort  Sitting in this car is quite nice  the driver seat is fully adjustable in so many ways it would be hard not to find a good fit  One thing I don 146t understand is why there are no power controls on the passenger side seat  and why the power controls don 146t extend to the lumbar support and seat tilt on the driver side  Really  if you 146re going to go power  please just go all the way  However  all power controls are close at hand  including those to the windows and moonroof  and one touch butt warmers  so nice  and this ease of use extends to the space age silver temp audio console  Everything is within reach and self explanatory  no muddling about with buttons trying to figure out what does which  One control which is not in the best location is the all too important GEAR SHIFT  Come on guys  Why make the gear shift handle block the view of the gear shift indicator  Being a new car  I don 146t yet have a good feel of where drive  neutral  etc  are  and it is quite disconcerting to have to move my head around to see what gear I have shifted too  I am sure this is something that will come to bother me less in time  as I develop a feel for the car  but right now it is an irritating testament to Ford quality  or not  The backseat is also quite roomy and comfortable  even for a full size adult  which I am not  measuring in at a mere 5 ft tall  but even my husband had room to move his feet around  This comfort tested out for both the side and middle seats  so there should be minimal fussing over which child goes where  As far as storage areas go  this car offers plenty  The glove box and armrest console are quite roomy  and there is some storage built in for CD cases  There are 2 potentially useful bins underneath the audio console  one with an extra power jack  and 2 good sized cupholders  one of which holds a removable ashtray  This would give you room for a cell phone  sunglasses  and some change  but looks prone to collecting semi useless junk that wont quite stay in place  One nice feature is the press able garage door opener holder that sits above the rear view mirror  The rear cargo area  as stated before  also seems quite useful  and the rear seats fold down to allow for oversized objects I Practicality   Well  the guts of this review should be how well this car works and drives  and here it is  although I can 146t promise this will show off my reviewing ability to its finest  I am not a car connoisseur  and I know little about the mechanical innards that make them go  I am writing this from the point of view of your average driver  not an expert on the subject by any means  Well  with the disclaimer in place  here goes  I am a truck driver by nature  having graduated to my Escape from a Ford Ranger Splash  and I was unsure of how I would like the  147car chassy 148 feel of the Escape  Well  I like it  I can 146t say that it drives like my truck  but it does have a similar feel  including the better visibility that comes with the extra height  The car has a nice amount of pick up  but it does take some time to switch gears  about 2 seconds after I think it should have  which can be slightly disconcerting  Once going  the car cruises along quite happily  without any feel of a struggle  I have read in some reviews that there is excessive wind noise  however I did not find this to be the case  Perhaps it is because I am used to trucks  which tend to be louder than cars  The car has some nice driving features  my favorite of which is the 4WD  I am used to the 3 option 4WD    off  low  or high  with appropriate measures needed to switch from one to the other  This little truck has a nice  147auto 148 feature  which enables the car to switch power to whichever wheel needs it most  This essentially allows you to have 4WD on all the time  without the excess fuel consumption  There is  of course  also the option of putting it in full time 4WD  presumably better for snowy or slippery conditions  Overall  the car feels quite stable  I always feel like it is  in control  with no fear of swaying or tipping  It feels like a quality ride b Synposis  I am quite happy with my new little Escape  I will gingerly classify it as a  147luxury 148 SUV  because in the Limited model  it has the finest equipment one could want in a utility vehicle  It has a nice upscale feel to it  and it drives quite nicely  forming a near perfect hybrid of car and truck  I think it makes a nice alternative to both the unimaginative mini van and the fuel guzzling true trucks or SUV  It may just make a perfect match for someone who needs extra space for children and accompanying accessories  but who does not want to give up owning a luxury car b POST NOTE b While this review is on a 2003 Escape  for some reason Epinions did not offer 2003 as an option in the  model year  drop down window  Fear not  it is not a review of a 2002 car  
Pos, Yes indeed  this  compact  SUV is a gentle ride with superb  responsive handling  Braking is smooth and crisp and the 16 inch wheels are very nice  The exterior looks are clean  sporty and have a touch of elegance  especially with the 2 tone grey lower body moulding  The Mach stereo is quite bold and the 6 CD changer is handy to have  saves me from fishing around in the center console for another disc  The 2 tone leather seating is elegant and upscale  the storage pods are plenty and the leg room for driver and passenger belies its size  The sun roof is easy to operate and an option with every penny when you can smell the sweet breeze Initially I wasn t wild about the color of my Escape  red  but it s really more of a rich ruby and I ve received a ton of compliments on the hue Mostly though I appreciate the safety factors such as the front and side air bags and the ABS braking capabilities On the down side  as I glance over my left shoulder in preparation for a lane change  the visual is not clear  and folding down the rear seats is more complicated than it should be  The gear shift lever is too long and sometimes gets in the way of the nicely placed instrument panel  The fabled  wind noise  problem is corrected for me by rolling up windows Folks  I m a long time GMC  Jimmy  owner and I was skeptical of a Ford product  Believe me  my initial resistance has been replaced by cheerleading for this frisky  sporty  sophisticated SUV  Additionally  almost all of the sites I visited through various search engines raved about the Escape  More importantly  owners of Escapes did too I can recommend the 2003 Ford Escape XLT Premium without qualification  You ll be so happy with this vehicle  
Pos, I bought this truck new  had 800 Miles on it  that s new in my book  about 2 weeks ago  Although I have only had it for a short time  I find the ride very enjoyable  on the highway as well as through town  Through town the ride is a little bumpy  but it  quot is quot  a pickup truck  Considering its center of gravity is a little higher than the standard models  because of the 235 tires  It corners fairly well for a pickup truck The 4 0L V6 provides plenty of power  decent acceleration as well as a good amount of torque  I get about 17 Miles to the gallon on the Highway  that s traveling between 75 and 85 MPH  It also has good mid level acceleration  from 35 to 65 MPH  The truck boasts a top speed of about 102MPH  The 5 gear automatic transmission s shifting is almost unnoticeable even under heavy acceleration  It is also equipped with an overdrive switch to limit the transmission to the 4 base gears for those up and down back road trips we all love so much  The cast aluminum deep dish wheels look very sharp on this truck  Another nice feature is the Vacuum Lock 4X4 switching  which allows the truck to be switched from 2w high to 4w high and back to 2w high at almost any speed  The interior of the truck is well laid out  The 60 40 split front seat is quite comfortable  and the center fold up Arm Rest tape holder CD holder Change holder is also a very nice feature  Although the cab is pretty roomy  It is hard for me to imagine 2 grown adults being able to sit on the tiny fold down seats provided in the extended cab  The space within the extended portion of the cab is made super accessible by the two fold out doors on either side  These doors are very well hidden  so well hidden in fact it took me 2 days to realize my new truck was actually a 4 door  There is plenty of room for a great deal of cargo back there  And loading and unloading is a snap My advice for someone thinking of purchasing one of these trucks  is to go with the Extended Cab 4x4 with the 4 0L V6  I have heard from many that the 3 0L V6 and the 2 5L 4 are both under powered for this truck   Besides bigger is usually better  Once I have had this truck a little longer and have more info about the reliability I will write some more reviews on it  I am also planning on making some modifications on this truck which I will also share with you all br br  
Pos, First let me say that as a rock star  I object to the stereotypical view of people who own pickup trucks as rednecks  I am on the cutting edge of music and fashion  and I ve never owned a pair of boots in my life  That said  I must tell you that the 1999 Ford Ranger extended cab is the perfect vehicle for a young musician such as myself  The bed is plenty big enough for all of my band s equipment  There s more than enough power to haul it all around the southeastern US  The cab is quite roomy  and the four door option makes it easy to lure 16 year old girls into it  The stereo is great  mine came with cassette and cd players  The outside appearance is sport enough to say  hey  I ve got style  but humble enough to not attract too much attention  I got the step side model  which I think looks really cool  almost as sexy as me Living in an urban area  you d think I d have trouble parking a 4x4 pickup  not so  Even though it s big enough to haul anything I could put in it  it s small enough to park anywhere I ve recomended this truck to all of my friends  Three of them took my recomendation and are now as happy as I am with it  
Pos, I d only driven Chevy products until recently  I considered myself a die hard Chevy person  Then my mom got a new Ford Ranger SuperCab  I went to New York to visit her and wound up  having  to drive her truck while I was there  I mean she really had to twist my arm I was pretty astounded  I d never thought myself to be a truck girl  but I fell in love with this Ranger  It s a 1999 Cherry Red Ranger  fully loaded with CD player  electric everything  etc  The ride is incredibly smooth  and it has all the comforts of home If you re looking for a manly truck  this isn t for you  It s definitely more accomodating  with easy to use features and lots of gadgets  The SuperCab is helpful as well  as my mother has 3 children still at home  She drove from Illinois to New York with 2 adults and 2 children  all of their  quot stuff quot  and my new living room set with no problems  no cramping  etc  Plus  it s still stylish and fun to drive I took it off roading on the back roads in upstate New York  and it has quite of bit of pick up and go  With all of it s power and superior handling  I still wasn t overwhelmed  I m 5 3 quot  and weigh 110 lbs on a good day  so needless to say  I m used to driving really little cars  Chevy Cavalier  so I thought I d freak out having to drive a truck Not at all I highly recommend this truck for anyone who wants a fun  handy little truck br br  
Pos, I recommend this vehicle for it s safety as well as it s comfort  My husband and I liked it so much after we traded it the first time we went back to Ford and got the same truck back  The only downfall on this truck is that if you have more than one child who is ultimately going to grow up quicker than you can imagine then you will need to get the king cab  I have two children and as they grow older it is getting a bit crowded in the truck  Other than that it is a wonderful truck  It stands up much better than the other models as far as breakdowns and best built  A few months ago I backed into a dodge  which my husband wasn t very thrilled with  but the Ford never even got a scratch on it  The dodge on the other hand was so weakly built that it just dented immediately  Even my insurance agent was shocked  Not a scrap on it  So if you re looking for reliable and durable the Ford F150 XL is the way to go br br  
Pos, OK  a little background on myself  I ve owned two Toyota 4wd pickups  one was an ExtraCab  one wasn t  I ve owned full size GMCs and Fords  and I ve driven just about all of the small pick up class brands  Second  let me give my disclaimer  Having owned a few pick ups in my life and knowing the loyalties that come with pick up ownership  I am not about to force my preference on anyone  However  I can honestly say that without any hesitation that I have never been happier with the truck I am driving today  I bought my 2000 Ford Ranger in March of 2000  The Ford dealership was the last place I went  only after combing the Toyota  Nissan  and Chevy lots  Nissan went out the window after about ten minutes  Despite the weird looks of their entry into the smaller truck market  the salesman had the ability to annoy me right off the lot  quot that excite  cha   quot hey  buddy that excite  cha quot whatever  Nissan  Anyway  Toyota almost had me  I ve been a fan of Toyotas for awhile and would still recommend them to anyone that had the money and didn t mind having to buy a new truck every few years  Thats my only gripe about Toyota  They just seem to give way and start to feel a little shaky after a few years of semi hard driving  I d hate to see how they fare in real difficult terrain  Another minus  The paper thin doors  As far as Chevy goes  close but not quite  Chevy seems to have a decent product  but I think that if you are going to go for a Chevy  make it a full size  One thing I ve never really liked about Chevy is that they have never impressed me as a  working  truck  They always seemed too  street  for me  On to Ford  Despite having had on of the closest to pleasant experiences I ve ever had at a dealership  the Ranger just worked for me  Solid doors and tailgate  the windows closed tightly  and the engine and transmission worked  and still work  like they should  I purchased the 3 0 V6  and so far have had no problems  Semi frequent obstacles have required me to utilize the shift on the fly 4WD  which has worked like a charm  Only once  on the beach  has it felt a little squirrely  But we survived intact  I still believe that a truck is a truck  and you are never going to get loyalists to change their views on which is best  I m glad I did  though  I guess my ultimate advice is this  If you want to buy a truck  go to every brand dealer and drive them all  full size and smaller versions  Thats what I did  and it put me in the seat of the Ranger  and firmly planted in my mind that my next truck will be a Ranger  too br br  
Pos, I m currently leasing a brand new 2000 Ford Ranger Truck  It s a 4 wheel drive with a V 6 engine  It rides pretty smooth and it came with all the accessories and I do mean ALL  I love the CD player  This is my first truck and it wasn t my first choice  Money was a factor since I still owed on my other car and trucks depreciate less I ve been told  All in all I like it  Besides the accessories  I like the fact that I sit high up and the 4 wheel drive will come in handy in the snow  I live in Minnesota  It also has a step on the side to get up into the the pick up area if you are carrying something in back  It would be great for moving big furniture  I find it hard to get back into the extended cab area  however  to store things  I miss my trunk  Also  it doesn t get good gas mileage and I drive a lot for my job  THere s also this annoying sound when you don t buckle your seat belt right away  It will ding about ten times very fast and if you still don t put your seat belt on it will continue to do this every minute  O K  Already  Anyway  so far  it has turned out to be a nice little truck for me br br  
Pos, I bought my 1991 Ford Taurus L Wagon from a local used car lot in really good condition  It said 71 XXX on the five digit odometer so there was no telling how many miles was on it  I needed to have a car  and I always admired the Ford Taurus Wagons  I took it on a test drive  and fell in love with the handling and with some of the features  I purchased the car for  2 000 doing a  Buy here  Pay here  financing  Which I later paid it off early and only paid  1 800 for it  I took a trip the same day about 50 miles away from my home  On my way I ended up getting a speeding ticket for 80mph in a 65mph  I was actually so impressed with the handling and quality of ride  I was unaware that I was speeding  I was just watching the road  I made that trip  and back  and an extra couple of days on that full tank of gas  which impressed me for being a wagon  After a while I started noticing the  flaws  in it  I started having problems with the transmission  it started lacking Horsepower  and the AC started getting warm  The rear wiper motor and rear defroster stopped working  I ended up re charging the AC retrofitted  and replacing the thermostat  water pump  radiator  the original one cracked and exploded  could have caused serious injury  both front motor mounts  and a battery  Though we replaced a lot of stuff  we live in the mountains in NC and put about 20 000 miles a year on it  and I was very impressed with how this 10 year old car took the stresses of everyday climbing hills and pulling a lot of weight with its front wheel drive  I sold this wagon to get a 92 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser  Check out that review later  
Pos, I recently had to rent a car after a snowy truck accident  So they gave me a Ford Focus from enterprise Exterior The new  edge  styling looks pretty cool  It s modern and attractive for a car in my opinion  The wheelbase is a little longer than a comparable Honda Civic Interior The dashboard is clean and functional  The instrument panel also has that new  modern  look and feel to it  The stereo and a c settings are pretty easy to use  and the buttons are well defined and easy to access The stereo reception isn t the greatest and the system is sub par overall The seats are pretty comfortable but lacks in lumbar support and armrest  I still found it to be fairly comfortable for everyday driving Driving Experience It surprisingly handled pretty well for a car in its class  Very European like feel  However  the steering wheel tended to vibrate a lot over rough pavement  And be prepared for a noisy ride The ride is actually pretty comfortable  I was pleasantly surprised  It s a bit on the firm side  and you still feel all the road s irregularities  but it s a lot better than most cars in its class The one thing that did bother me a bit was the amount of road engine noise  I ve heard that a comparable Hyundai Elantra does an excellent job of keeping the road engine noise down  and that car costs less than a comparable Ford Focus  Something for the Ford engineers to shoot for  This is a great value and its great fun to drive My only complaints are the noise and the always vibrating steering wheel It would have got a 4 star if it wasn t for that annoying vibrating steering wheel  trust me  it vibrates like crazy  
Pos, I bought my Aerostar Van brand new in 1992  I still drive and enjoy my van to this very day  Every time I think about trading it in for a newer vehicle I can t think of anything I would rather have to drive  I bought the extended version of the Aerostar because I wanted and needed the extra space  I can get all my groceries in the back  the kids toys and necessities when traveling to Grandma s house  and when going on a long trip suitcases and everything the kids  quot have to bring quot  along fit nicely in the extend space  I just don t understand how people who have regular mini vans fit everything in when going on vacations  I can t imagine what the passenger area looks like  The extend area of the Aerostar allows for comfortable and less crowded seating when hauling items  The seats are removable allowing for even more room for hauling large items  We have carried lumber  furniture  mattresses  and even key stones in the back of our Aerostar van  It is almost like having a truck and van in one  The seats are not easily removed and it can be necessary to have help in taking them out My Aerostar is currently 8 years old and all I have ever really had to replace is regular wear and tear items  I ve only had to replace the brakes twice and it is on it s second set of tires  One thing I don t like about the Aerostar is that when the brakes get wet  and you go to use them  they are extremely touchy  They are so touchy that everyone is jerked forward when you touch the brakes  Usually this only happens during the first couple of times of using them until they dry out It is for these reasons that I still haven t had the desire to trade my old Aerostar Van in for a newer and fancier van  I value the extended part of the van too much to get a newer one that doesn t offer the extra room in the back  I could care less about dual side opening doors  remote door openers  or less mileage just give me more rear space and I m a happy camper br br  
Pos,  PLEASE NOTICE THIS IS A REVIEW FOR A 1998 ESCORT ZX2  NOT A STANDARD ESCORT Just recently early this year  I have the opportunity to purchase this fine automobile they call an escort ZX2  I previously owned a Geo Tracker which went completely belly up on me for the fourth time  grrr  and thought it was time for a new change  also being that I desperately needed a car for spring break  and fast  I didn t waste any time to go to the town car dealership and I checked out their used car lot  They had plenty of cars there  but I had my eye on one car in particular and that was the ZX2 I was able to purchase this car remarkably for  3000  I have been a proud owner ever since  and I have had all kinds of crazy ideas on what to do to it next  Hopefully  eventually  I plan on putting a subtle body kit that will bring the lines of the car out a little more  This car is an extremely under rated car  It drives me nuts that magazines don t talk about them much  if at all  I mean  for some reason  Ford wanted to replace this car with the Focus ZX3 which  don t get me wrong  is a great car  but so is the ZX2  Well  enough about how I feel  on with the review b LOOKS b Overall  The ZX2 offers a very tasteful  sporty lines that are a step up from its Escort Coupe counterpart  Honestly  I prefer  the ZX2 over the Escort Coupe one reason only  It looks a heck of a lot better  I mean  when you drive  you want something that will turn heads  The ZX2 hopefully will do that  Also  if the factory setup isn t everything that you were looking for in a ZX2  there are plenty of body kits available for this model  Knowing where to look is the hard part  Magazines tend to leave out this fine automobile and look past its potential in becoming an excellent custom  Wings West offers an excellent  subtle body kit that is if you have the money  This body kit  as well as many others  don t come cheap b DRIVETRAIN b The Escort ZX2 is powered by the 2 0 liter  16 valve  dual overhead cam ZETEC engine which pumps out 130 horsepower stock  This car is available with a 5 speed manual transmission  or a 4 speed automatic  This car has an incredible amount of acceleration  The only disappointing fact is that Ford put a governor at 106 mph on all ZX2 models except the s r models  which has an improved cam timing  and a speedo cluster that goes up to 150 mph instead of 120 mph like the other models  Also  the s r has 150 horsepower  This car is a limited edition car that was offered in 1999 and 2000  But with a little bit of money  you can get the same performance out of your ZX2 as you can out of the s r possibly  maybe more b INTERIOR b Inside the ZX2  you will find that there is plenty of room in the front  and viewing is excellent from inside  the car has solar glass that tints slightly to the sun  The seats are very comfortable  and provide a very smooth ride  The back doesn t have as much leg room as one would anticipate  but the seats are very comfortable  The roof is slightly low in the back which makes it slightly difficult for taller people to sit in the back   HANDLING b The car is a very responsive car  It will quite possibly turn on a dime  I don t know what else to say about it other than  it handles real good b BRAKING b Just like any car  brakes need to be serviced  I changed the brakes on my ZX2 as soon as I purchased it  So far  I can t complain about the braking  except  I did experience the brakes locking up on me when turning off of a highway  It was rather scary  Fortunately  no one was in front of me  or in the other lane  I would HIGHLY recommend getting ABS brakes as an option if it doesn t come standard  I obviously don t have them after that little incident b SAFETY b My 1998 ZX2 comes standard with driver and passenger second generation air bags  ABS was an option back in 1998  not sure if it still is now  but if it isn t  like I said before  It would be very beneficial if you do get that My ZX2 is a 1998  Even though this is a review for a 1998  the whole design of the car hasn t been altered between 1998 2002  Maybe the only difference is that  Escort  was dropped off the rear bumper  My ZX2 hasn t failed me and I got mine USED with 75000 miles on it  I haven t had a problem with it yet and hopefully I won t for a long time  My ZX2 has about every option offered for the 98 model  It has power windows  power moon roof  power mirrors  alloy wheels  rear spoiler  6 disc CD changer  memory driver seat  intermittent wipers  fog lights  did i forget anything  lol  This car is HOT  They are very affordable  and very reliable  If you haven t driven a Ford lately  maybe you should start with the ZX2  you will be hooked for life  
Pos, The first car I ever had was a 1981 Ford Escort  and the first new car I bought was a 1998 Escort ZX2  The only similarity between the two vehicles is the name  and that s not a bad thing Unlike the underpowered Escort of old with the paper thin doors  the ZX2 feels like a car that isn t at the bottom of the new car price level  But the fact is the ZX2 is an affordable new car  I thinks it s the best car on the market for less than  15 000  In fact  it can be well below 15 grand if you can live without the spoiler and automatic transmission  It s more fun to drive with the manual transmission anyway After putting 43 000 miles on my ZX2 without a trip to the mechanic  I have to say I m thrilled with the car  It seems to have all the power you really need  but it isn t a gas hog with just a four cylinder engine  One of my favorite parts of the design is the wide wheelbase  which allows for excellent handling  It doesn t corner like a BMW  but you don t pay what you would for a true sports car And if you like loud music while you drive  the optional premium sound package with the CD changer is worth the money In short  this is a fine car for anyone who wants a fun  reliable car that won t make their insurance go way up  One warning This is not the perfect car for those with young children  Getting a car seat from the back would not be an easy chore br br  
Pos, Why did I buy this vehicle  My previous car was having problems  I needed a reliable car because I commuted to a college 27 miles away  I went shopping for used cars  but the dealership in my hometown  in Northern California  offered 0 9  financing on all 1998 Ford Escorts to buyers with good credit  I test drove the car  liked it  and decided to buy it  With the 0 9  financing  I got a brand new car for the same price that I could have bought a 7 or 8 thousand dollar used car  A new car was perfect for me because I needed something reliable  I love driving a car that gets 35 miles to the gallon  seats for comfortably  and can keep up with the two seaters  Having the efficiency of an economy car  the room of a family car  and a car that can climb the Siskiyou mountains  very steep  in fifth gear leaves me completely pleased with this car  It may sound corny but I can honestly say that I do not have one complaint about this car  considering the low price I paid for it  approximately  12800 and only 0 9  interest  When you test drive this vehicle  it will probably feel less swift than it actually is  This is because it is designed to be a commuter car  and it is unusually high geared  It is designed for the highway  not the speedway   You can feel the difference when driving a Contour  Who should buy this car    college students  reliability    commuters  great freeway car    families on a limited budget  has all the basic necessities of a quality car  at a price us poor folk can afford  Who shouldn t buy this car    hot rodders  like I said before  this car is for the highway not the speedway br br  
Pos, The 1998 Escort ZX2 was my first car purchase  I shopped around all of summer 1998 and bought the Escort in August  I bought it for three reasons  price  looks  and handling  Price  I bought it for  9998  with pretty much no features  radio  rear window defroster  I ve been following the used car market  and I ve noticed it s kept its value exceptionally well Looks  I bought the denim blue model  I really love the sleek lines  and low slung look of this car  Handling  This car drives like a dream  It accelerates quickly  hugs corners  and has lots of zip for a four cylinder engine If you are taller  I m 5 4 quot  you probably will feel cramped in this car  It is a perfect fit for me  I don t have to scoot the seat forward much to reach the pedals  which I do for most other vehicles  The fully loaded ZX2 came with some pretty neat stuff  like CD  ABS  moon roof  air conditioning  power door locks windows and remote keyless entry  I couldn t afford those extras  but it s nice to know I could have had them  The one noticeable lack was the absence of cruise control  For long trips the seats are comfy  the stereo is decent  but no cruise control is a drag  I highly recommend this car for commuters or for mostly in town driving  For long trips though  the gas mileage is great  It has quite a bit of trunk space for a coupe  and the back seats are pretty spacious     
Pos, My husband owns a 1998 Ford Escort ZX2  He loves his little car  He always talks about it and talks of how people compliment him on the look of the car  At first we bought this car because of the low price  As we began to drive it more often we decided we liked it better than cars we ve owned in the past  The things I love about this car is the quick acceleration and sporty look  The gas mileage is good for a sports car  We usually get around 35 city 45 highway  The downfalls are the lack of head room and the loud running engine  It is nice to drive this vehicle around town because of how fast it will get up and go  It is easy to pass slow drivers and make that yellow light  I think this car would be best for the teenagers  Thanks   
Pos, When I went out looking for a vehicle I had the price and how long the car would last in mind  Price was comparable with other makes and models so I checked on the length of time it would last  People I had talked to who owned them had nothing but good things to say about the long lasting motor and body  That to me was a plus  It is comfortable unless you go on a very lengthy trip then the driver side seat tends to get uncomfortable  After driving the vehicle to work for quite sometime I found it was very good on gas  I drive an estimated 25 miles to work 6 days a week so on an average I drive 300 miles a week and fill my gas tank once  The car handles very well in the winter  I live close to the snow belt here in Michigan so I need something dependable  The bigger vehicles just don t make me feel as safe as driving smaller vehicles  I feel as though I have more control over my actions and I have found this particularly comforting with this vehicle We have for the first snow falls this year parked a 4x4 truck we own and drove the escort solely since the truck was all over the road  The escort went without a problem The things I can say I tend to hate about the vehicle is that you can only have three beverages in the car with only three cup holders  That are also small and the two front ones are too close to the dash so only short cups will fit  Sitting in the back seat is uncomfortable if you have a tall person sitting in front  The seats crack and creek when a heavier set person sits in front so I feel as though they aren t built as solidly Overall I would say this is a very economical vehicle worth the money if you are looking for something mechanically well built  Unfortunately for the taller and well built man this would not be the type vehicle to own  If you are a smoker sadly you must pay an extra charge for an ashtray the size of a tennis ball and only one per vehicle br br  
Pos, I bought the car because my dad bought the first escort back in 84 and i wanted to be like dad  I waited till there was an escort worthy of a by from me and I m not just bragging because I own one  it is one of the most reliable cars on the market I didn t just go out and buy it because it was a ford and I looked at the market and it really was the best in power and in gas mileage and in over all performance I would give this car an 11 out of 10 on looks and handing  well as for theft protecting i does have some flaws there mine was stolen twice from me in the state of Tennessee and i was lucky to be able to say I have the car in my hands once more  mine is green in color and use to have five spoke 14 quot  rims but i have to replace them all I would recommend for every one to get steel rims for your escort br br  
Pos, I recently purchased a 1998 Ford Escort Station Wagon  I can t tell you how much I love it  I drive almost 70 miles per day  5 days a week  That car just keeps going and going  I am getting roughly 32 miles to the gallon so I certainly can t complain about that The interior is comfortable  almost like a luxury car  There is plenty of room for all the people you want to bring along  the dog  cats  luggage  anything that you want to go with you  The maintenance on this car is virtually non existent  The tires are the kind where you can buy them most anywhere in stock and they are not that expensive I have AC  a really good stereo system  rear wiper and sprayer  keyless entry on the back and the drivers side door  Of course it has roll down windows  but that is one less thing that can go wrong when you have the electric ones  The brakes are power which I prefer  not the ABS which I can t seem to get used to when I drive my husband s car All in all  I am very pleased with this car  It has plenty of power  speeds along especially on the highway where I do most of my driving  It is a beautiful Sable Green color and is a very attractive wagon  Also have a roof rack for any extras  I love this wagon  If you would be in the market for a wagon  check these out  I am just disappointed that they don t make these anymore  
Pos, This is my first new car and I was interested in getting the best car for the cheapest price  and that is what I got with the Ford Escort  The price was great  and I even got extras  Automatic door lock  air conditioning  automatic transmission  were all included  The only problem with the climate control is the heat does not get REALLY hot and it does take a long time to heat up  this occurs only in the severe cold  The air conditioner works immediately and gets REALLY cold  The only other  quot problem quot  or disadvantage with this car is the pick up  I do not notice any problem until I am merging into heavy traffic and have to make a quick entrance onto the roadway it just doesn t happen  The engine revs  but I find myself pushing myself back and forth  in a futile attempt to get the car to perform faster  Other than those 2 minor disadvantages  the car is wonderful  It is small enough to get in and out of places easily  yet does not compromise comfort   I suppose if you weighed over 200 lbs  there might be a problem  Very smooth ride  and easy to handle  The back seats are split and either one can come down  or both  and give more trunk room  I notice of all my cars and I have had many this one has the most useable trunk space never have problems with my groceries  Gas mileage is great  The only thing I have ever had done was oil changes and have had no mechanical problems  It is a great car  for a family of 4  2 kids and 2 adults fit with no  quot room quot  problems     
Pos, My Ford Escort is my first car  I purchased a Ford because it was made in the United States and I wanted to feel like I was giving back to my community in some way  I also got a Ford because Ford products are good and reliable products for the most part  My parents had a Ford type vehicle at one point when I was a child and I really liked that car  They also had a Ford Explorer when I got my Escort  So Ford has been a tradition in my family  My favorite feature is my sound system  I love music and the sound system is good  The bass and the treble sound great  It has enough clarity to play my tunes and keep me happy  I do waiver about whether I like the fact that the antenna has to be manually pulled up  But I mostly like the fact that it is manual at least it s something I don t have to worry about when I got through the car wash and for the most part I don t need it for the stations that I listen to on a regular basis  My Ford Escort has enough get up and go for me too  I have a 34 mile commute to work and school five days a week  but I don t seem to need to fill up the gas tank more than once a week for the most part  In cold weather  my car has performed up to the standards I think it should as well  Overall I have no real complaints about my 1998 Ford Escort  I was a little sad that they were discontinuing the Escort in favor of the Focus  
Pos, I was originally looking for a Honda and willing to pay the extra thousands of dollars I saved when I purchased my Ford Escort ZX2 Starting college in Sept I ll have enough expenses without spending a lot on a car  I didn t even know what a Ford Escort was and when I was looking for cars  It caught my eye  It s good on gas and has the power to get up and go  I wish it had a little more leg room in the back for passengers but as the driver I don t have any complaints  I drove a Toyota Camry prior to my escort and I don t feel any difference in the way it handles  I basically will use my car to commute to school Anyone looking for a economical car should check out the ZX2  You ll be surprised it s a Ford Escort  Excellent for moms with small children since it is a two door  Being a two door it is a little difficult for larger people to get in and out of the back as any two door might be     
Pos, My 1998 Ford Escort has almost 36 000 on it and I must tell you I have been very happy with my car  It is a four door  and the back seat is very roomy  My kids can have their friends go with us on trips  as 3 people can fit in the back seat  The front seats tilt back enough for roomy leg room  My six foot 2 son s head does not hit the roof  It is also very good on gas  A tank of gas can last me around 150 miles  I think it is very easy to drive and compact enough to find a good parking spot  The trunk is spacious  also  We camp a lot and I can fit in the trunk all the gear we need for a weekend  including tent  sleeping bags  firewood and cooler  I plan to pass this car along to my youngest when he turns 16  I m sure it will run as well for him as it has for me br br  
Pos, I am the second owner of a cute little 1991 red Ford Tempo  My Tempo ha 114 000 miles on it and it is still running like a top  I payed  1 900 for it and so far it had been worth every single penny  My parents own a 1987 Tempo and they will tell you the same thing the Tempo is a great  reliable car  But back to my car  Tempos are great cars for the kind of conditions i have to endure  In the summer it is blazing hot  but the Tempo is fully equiped for that  The 91 model has a newer AC unit in it that always keeps the car comfortable  In the winter i have to contend with lots and lots of snow  The Tempo is great for that because of it awsome front wheel drive and its ability to start in sub zero weather  The previous owner of my Tempo was a college student like my self  She took excelent care of the car and it shows  My car has verry little rust  and the only matenence done on it so far is the 100 000 mile tune up and regular oil changes  The only disadvantages to the Tempo are it seats  it ability for top speed  and it breaks  The seats are very likely to make your back sore if you are driving for more than an hour straight  the Tempos top speed is about 70 miles per hour so freeway driving kind of sucks  and the break roters have to be switched quite often  Other than that the temo is a great affordable car     
Pos, We bought a big  beat up truck so that no one  ever again  drove into me in my little car  It worked  This is the best car I have ever owned b WHY WE BOUGHT THIS CAR  When we moved to NY from South Africa in 1998 we bought a small  zippy Hyundai Accent  In the first three months of driving  six  people literally just drove into us  Either they didn t see my little car  or they thought they were bigger so didn t care whether I got out of the way  Since I was driving with my little son in the car we decided to buy the  biggest  thing we could afford  which turned out to be a 1989 Ford Bronco XLT  It has a bull bar on the front  a tow bar on the back and metal steps on both sides  It is rusty and dented  and since we got it I don t think I have been cut off in the traffic once b DRIVING AND MAINTENANCE  On the sensible side  we get a tune up once a year  and the engine runs like a dream  It feels safe and solid up to about 65mph  but I try to be a little careful about cornering  It accelerates like the wind  I had to replace the alternator  but otherwise I haven t had any breakdowns in 2 years  Lots of small  irritating things have had to be fixed  like the door hinges  the doors wouldn t stay open  the wiring for the back power window and a side window  and the interior light  That s just because it s old  I guess  Generally all the repairs have been really cheap  we replaced part of the exhaust on the Hyundai  just the part was over  200  the same piece on the Bronco was  19 I strongly believe that in any accident my family will be better off in this car than just about any other  particularly in our price range  All in all this truck is a joy to drive  and I must admit I rather like the image too  br br  
Pos, I love my Bronco  I think it has been the best running vehicle I have ever owned  I bought it because it was such a good deal  that I just couldn t pass it up  I ve wanted one because they looked roomy  One day I was out running around and saw it  at such a low price  I just had to have it  So I took it out for a test drive and it handled so well I took it to have my dad look at it  he went with me driving around  We took it back to the lot and filled out the paper work  I got to take it that night  I drove around for hours  I knew I that I didn t go wrong  I just love to go driving around because it runs like a dream  is real smooth  I like this vehicle so much  if I was to win the lottery  my whole family would own one  If you want to enjoy your ride to the store or just anywhere this is the vehicle for you  There is plenty of space to put a stroller  groceries  and the kids too  People who can t judge distance of your cars should not own this vehicle  because you are pretty high up and the front looks pretty wide  If you ask me  you should own one br br  
Pos, Our small business needed a cargo van a year ago and you can t really buy a cargo van without at least considering the Econoline  The Big Three all make cargo vans that are comparable in size  cargo capacity and price  We researched  measured and drove each van for at least 3 days before we made the choice to buy the Ford We found the Ford to be the easiest to drive and the best equipped for the price no matter what engine you choose  The Chevy Express Cargo Van was a good second choice but was a little more expensive and the financing offered by GMAC at the time was inferior  The Dodge Van frankly hasn t changed a lot since the 70 s and it shows in every aspect We ended up with the E250 3 4 ton model with the V 6 engine  This engine is rated at 190 horsepower and can pull the van reasonably well unless you load it full of tools or heavy equipment  Users who will push the limits of the van s cargo capacity will not like the V 6  The ONLY advantage of the V 6 is the lower acquisition cost  The 4 6L V 8 makes more power and gets better gas mileage  not to mention better resale value if you sell the van before it is a box of rust We have had no mechanical troubles at all and have put 10 000 miles on it to date  There are a lot of these vans on the road today with over 200 000 miles on them  If we had to do it again we would get the V 8  Otherwise you really cannot go wrong with this van as a great work vehicle     
Pos, Are you looking for a work van   Ford Econoline is the way to go  I haven t owned anything beside a ford van  My last van was a gray Ford Econoline 350  With proper care it lasted me ten years  I bought another van this year  I was contemplating on whether I should try another van  I couldn t even think of another van that would have what I needed  My vans usually go through a lot of wear and tear  I drive around all day from place to place  It is not the most comfortable vehicle though and it can only hold 2 passengers  If you are looking for something to be comfortable  this is not the way to go  It is comfortable for many work vans that I have been in  I would choose a car to drive around in if I didn t have to carry all of my equipment  It is a very economical and durable vehicle     
Pos,  Needs b After three years of driving my  college car  a Geo Metro  and heady with a summer s worth of paychecks  aka  more money than I d ever seen  I was in the market for an SUV  I d spent the last three years hydroplaning all over Arkansas  highways  I wanted something big  heavy  and solid to drive  I also wanted more power than my little three cylinder I eventually settled on a  Ford Explorer   I started shopping around thinking I wanted all the bells and whistles  namely four wheel drive  I  wisely  ended up with a two wheel drive  Explorer Sport   The two door  Sport  is about a foot shorter than the four door model and seemed huge enough after my Metro  I was also living in Texas and really couldn t justify four wheel drive I m not the off roading type and when Texas gets bad weather  everything completely shuts down anyway  snow and ice holidays yea b Gas Mileage b Let me get this category out of the way  Yes  my SUV is a gas hog  My  Explorer  does have a standard transmission which gets slightly better gas mileage than an automatic  What irks me about all the condemnation of SUVs for sucking down large amounts of gasoline is that mini vans are just as bad in this respect or any other vehicle with a six or eight cylinder engine  While SUVs are  status symbols  mini vans are  family vehicles  and trucks are  quot work vehicles quot  But  I digress b Features b i Anti lock brakes i  Not only has the ABS on my  Explorer   saved me from injury  it also saved me from rear ending a military police car as my  Explorer  slid approximately fifteen feet down an icy incline at a stop sign at Fort Leavenworth  Kansas  in January  The ABS kicked in almost immediately and I was able to stop the vehicle a few inches short of the police car  I also honked the horn to warn the MP that I was on a collision path with his vehicle but he didn t have enough time to react i Visors i  I m rather short  especially when seated  so no visor is perfect or long enough for me  What I like about the  Explorer s  visors are that there are two  one to flip over to the side  and another to flip down in front so that the driver and front seat passenger aren t moving one visor back and forth on a curvy road  Yes  this is a little thing  but the great thing about my  Explorer  are all the details  like an attached gas cap  that add up to comfort and convenience i Cargo Area i  Very roomy  The back seats also fold down  The cargo capacity is by far the most useful feature of this vehicle  I move  on average  every twelve months  and with the cargo capacity  I can take a good chunk of things I ll need right away in my new home  as well as pets  plants  and all the things the movers won t touch like cleaning supplies  batteries  alcohol  Because I have an SUV  the Army will reimburse me a few hundred dollars for moving up to six hundred pounds of my own stuff that I would take with me anyway  I ve crammed about seven hundred pounds in the cargo area and my bike on the luggage rack on top and could still see out the back window  Whenever I buy a piece of furniture  no problem  load it up  Note  as a safety precaution  if you can t close the cargo door completely  drive with the windows down so that any exhaust fumes that may come in aren t overpowering i Cruise Control i  Once you have it  you can t go without it again  I ve driven across the country with and without cruise control  and I prefer having it  The troublesome sciatic nerve in my right thigh also prefers it b Handling b i Stability i  Excellent  Yes  I know all the current furor over the  Explorer s  stability  I ve found my  Explorer  as stable or more stable than other SUVs and high center of gravity vehicles  including the Toyota pickup upon which I learned to drive a standard transmission  I also don t drive like a maniac or a race car driver  The handling on higher vehicles is different than cars acknowledge this from the outset and drive accordingly  As a petite woman  being up high is an advantage for me  I can see the entire road and feel safer and more aware  I recommend that short people get the step  I don t have one and it s not a problem normally  but getting in the seat can be somewhat tricky when I m wearing a mini skirt i Turning Radius i  Excellent  The  Explorer Sport  has an exceedingly tight turning radius for a vehicle its size  I ve driven the four door  Explorer  and the turning radius isn t as great  I easily swing into slanted parking spaces from the opposite direction or make U turns without hitting curbs b Repairs and Maintenance b I ve owned my  Explorer  for six years and other than the  tires   the extent of my repairs and maintenance are as follows  regular oil changes  about every 5 7 000 miles  a new air filter last summer  adjusted brakes this fall at 62 000 miles  some new belts  also at 62 000 miles  when the original ones began to dry rot  new windshield wipers a couple years ago  and I had to use epoxy to glue the gear shift knob back on when it came loose  All the repairs were recommended to me as preventive measures when I took the vehicle in for regular maintenance  I ve never taken my  Explorer  in for  quot problems quot All of the owner operator maintenance parts of the engine  like the oil wand and the opening for adding more windshield wiper fluid  are clearly marked in yellow for dummies like me who don t really know what they re looking for underneath the hood My  Explorer s  rear driver side was dented in a hit and run accident when the vehicle was parked  causing  900 in damages  promptly fixed  One of the tires exploded  my parents were driving so I don t know the details  and caused another  900 in damage to the same area  grrr Firestones  again promptly fixed  I can t tell any difference from when the vehicle was brand new  I also had another Firestone tire  front  driver s side  disintegrate while I was driving 70mph on the highway  I maintained control of the vehicle and came to a stop on the side of the road  Other than the tire  my  Explorer  suffered no damage whatsoever and handled well throughout the incident   And now I have five brand new Firestones I have the extended seven year warranty and haven t used it once  Definitely a waste of money and completely unnecessary for this vehicle b Cost b The sale price of my 1994  Explorer Sport   purchased in September 1994  was  18 168  bargained down from  21 000  sticker price  I probably could have gone lower  but I had the financial wherewithal to pay off my loan in 3 5 years  I m pretty satisfied  especially given that my insurance premiums did not increase significantly from my Metro  and I haven t had to shell out outrageous amounts for maintenance and repairs b Conclusion b My 1994  Explorer  was a good buy and I am loathe to give it up  However  my needs have changed I m moving to a climate that requires four or all wheel drive and I plan to start a family in a few years so a four door model is in order  Will I buy another  Explorer   I m still researching  but I ve narrowed the field to the 2001 all wheel drive  four door  Explorer  and the 2001 four wheel drive  four door  Nissan Pathfinder   I ll let you know in about six months or so  Happy driving br br  
Pos, I bought an  86 crown victoria for less than one thousand dollars and it never ceases to amaze me  It s got a V8  a 5 liter engine  and over one hundred and fifty horse power  This car might be old but it can definitely kick some but  It has a great pick up I have ran into a couple of problems with this car including  windows not working  alternator not working  A C not cold enough  and some little minor problems  But the car is 14 years old and it is bound to have some problems  I have had the car for about 2 years now and I have only brought it into the shop twice  Most of the problems that occur with this car are minor things that can be fixed without taking it to the shop  I love this car  It is a tank  I don t have to worry about dying in a car wreck in this car  You could probably run into a brick wall at 50 miles per hour and still walk away  It isn t hard at all to park  and it has a great suspension system  The speakers weren t too good though so I got them replaced  ad I put in a CD player  Other than that everything about my  Vic is cool  I love this car  I am going to keep it until I die or until it quits on me  I don t know which will come first It has tons of space also  Good for long distances br br  
Pos, I had gotten the bug to buy a used police car so I could yank the motor and other heavy duty items out of it for a Chevy project car I attended a Texas DPS  state police  auction to see what I could get  When they started auctioning off the Chevy Caprice s at  7000  for cars with 105 000 to 110 000 miles  I knew the prices were way out of line  anybody ever seen a used cop car  carpets all ripped  stains  loose wiring bundles etc  and set my sights on a lower priced vehicle  They finally brought out the Crown Vic s  which were all from a different agency  and the prices became more reasonable  I figured I could always adapt the Ford motor to my car if need be It had actually been used by the Alcoholic Beverage Commission in Brownsville and El Paso  The back seat looked like it had never been sat in  it was that clean  Trunk was so clean it looked like it had never been used  When I went to review the maintenance records after purchase  I found out that these cars had originally been ordered with 302 s  per VIN   but had actually come with 351W with Certified Calibration speedometer  Woohoo  Anybody wanting a cop car knows what this means  Even if you don t know it s a cop car  this is usually a dead giveaway and means all heavy duty components from the factory What I have found with this car mileage  sucks  really  I usually drive around 75mph on the highway and I can watch the gas gauge drop 1 2 tank over the course of about 150 miles braking  Haven t quite experienced brake fade but it is easy to think you re braking when you really aren t and have to squeeze harder on the pedal before rear ending someone power  initial acceleration sucks  but once it is up to speed and in the power band  you can barely tap the gas and it will accelerate quickly  and once it is going and you take your foot off the gas  it will continue to coast and barely slow down As noted by some other reviewers  I am having electric window problems  One doesn t work at all and another is slipping while going up  requiring me to manually push it up  But this isn t a big deal since I am the only who rides in this vehicle At this point  rather than yank the motor for my project car  I ve decided to strip the body off and use it as a base for a kitcar  like a Shelby Cobra or something  
Pos, I know this probably seems strange that I am writing this opinion instead of my husband but I love this truck  When I was 7 months pregnant with our second child my husband decided that we need a family car  I know this does not seem like a family car but it is used as our family car and I would not have it any other way  Why did we choose the Ford F150 SuperCab  First I have to say that my husband choose this vehicle  It would not had been my first choice  My first choice was the Ford Explorer  In the long run I am glad that my husband did not listen to me  I love driving this truck  It is so easy to drive  One of the main reasons we chose this truck is because my husband needed a large motor to pull his 19ft Wellcraft Open Fisherman four hours away from our home  That is a lot of wear and tear on a vehicle  The second reason my husband chose the Ford F150 is the size of it  It has a big bed for transporting items  As you already know if you have children  especially infants  that they require a lot of extra equipment when traveling  This was perfect  We could stuff all of the items in the back of the truck  So you are probably wondering what did we do when it rained  No we do not have top to it  We simply put tarps over the items we kept in the back  This seemed to do the trick Why do I like the Ford F150  I will admit at first I didn t like the truck  It did take some getting use to  First  it was really big and bulky  I can remember trying to park at the local store in town  I think all of the other people knew when I was coming because the parking lots were empty except for a few cars  Here I am in my big white Ford F150 trying to park  Can you only imagine  I know if my husband saw me during those first few months he would had probably banned me from driving the truck  So what did I do  Until I felt comfortable with parking next to cars and other trucks I would pick a parking space as far away as possible so I would not hit anyone  Okay men  you can laugh  Let s get serious about why I like the Ford F150 SuperCab  It is easy to drive  I like being up high where I can see everything while driving  If you are short like I am this is a nice feature  It gets decent gas mileage for a large engine  I believe it has a V8 or V6 in it  We get about 18 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the interstate  I feel safe in the big truck  We have actually tested out how safe our truck  My husband does a lot of hunting and you can only imagine what our first wreck was  While driving out in the country near my husband s hunting grounds a deer jumped in the window  Yes  you read that right  Unbelievable the truck only received a major blow to the passenger door and front window  We even drove the vehicle home that night  So I feel safe about Ford  Of course we had those unmentionable Firestone tires  Don t get me started on it  If you would like to read my review on Firestone Tires just look for Firestone Almost killed my family by davelaura  That will give you some idea how I view the tires that Ford uses on their vehicles  I don t approve of them  How do I feel when I drive my Ford F150  No  I don t feel like a redneck  I feel like myself  I love driving this truck and would not drive any other vehicle except maybe a Mercedes but I know that will never happen  Does the truck drive smooth on the open road  We do a lot of traveling and it is one of the smoothest vehicles I have been in  I used to drive a Volvo 760 and I would say this truck is almost has smooth as the car  Maybe I am pushing the truck a little too much  Are the seats comfortable  I will admit after four hours in the truck I do get a little cranky but who wouldn t after that long of a drive  Overall the truck is really comfortable and very roomy  I am sorry men if this doesn t help you but maybe it will help convince your wives why you need a truck  I was about to kill my husband when he purchased the truck  Now I love him for it     
Pos, I bought my F150 just over a year ago and I have had plenty of time to formulate an opinion     I decided to buy a full size pickup since I was in the military and figured I would be moving a lot  I had been looking at the Ford F 150 and the Dodge 1500  both in the same price feature zone  Here is what I discovered The Ford has features that make it better suited for the individual who will be travelling mainly highway or town miles for several reasons  First off  the fact that it has the best gas mileage of any truck in its class helps  and I have the Big V8 too  When you fill up a 24 gallon tank  that extra 2 miles per gallon helps believe it or not  Secondly  the acceleration on the Ford was outstanding  it was not sluggish at all which helps for changing lanes in heavy traffic  The anti lock breaks also offer better braking response than the Dodge  I have no complaints with payload either  I have an ATV that I drive right up into the bed  close the tailgate  and go on my way  With my weight and the ATV that is a total of about 800  pounds on the tailgate  and it takes it just fine without a single stress mark  Don t really even notice a difference in acceleration with the extra weight   Be careful on the turns though or you might lose your load  If you want to add a topper  the Ford has a locking tailgate so you can secure the bed without having to buy extra equipment Price will vary from dealer to dealer as you all know  but overall  the Ford dealers were more willing to drop their price to stay competitive than the Dodge dealers I dealt with  Using the site http www edmunds com I found the dealer invoice price so I knew how far they could really go  Surprisingly  the Ford dealer I bought from went  100 below their invoice to sell me a truck  Now grant it  it was near the end of the year clearance time  but they still beat the dodge by over  2500 There are some drawbacks though If you like loud music  like me  the stock stereo speakers deck are less than desirable  No problem right  Get some new speakers  Problem is  without some severe custom work  you can t even buy different speakers  That can be very costly if you don t know how to do it yourself Another sore point is the back seat  The Ford only has a 3 door extended cab  Dodge has 4 doors  and the back seat has about 4 inches less leg room than the Dodge  Because of the way the back seat folds down in the Ford  it makes installing subs or additional speakers almost impossible The Ford also does not offer any kind of convenience console like digital compass and temperature gauge  the Dodge does  No big deal  but here FYI Another piece of advice  that I wish I had adhered to  If you live in a climate that MIGHT get snow     SPEND THE EXTRA CASH ON 4 WHEEL DRIVE  I already regret not having it  Rear wheel drive only  even with weight in the bed  is darn near impossible to get up a snowy icy hill  I saw 10 or so pickups in the ditch this past winter  with little 4 cylinder front wheel drive cars passing them like nothing If you are an Urban Cowboy  the Ford is a great choice  If you want to do a lot of farm work or off roading  I would have to go with the Dodge or a larger ford  F 250 or F 350  The Ford handles more like a big car  and when you are behind the wheel of a Dodge  you know you are driving a truck br br  
Pos, This truck is an adventure every time that I step into it  First of all this is by far the larges vehicle that I ve been into  The triton V8 engine is so powerful I feel as if I could take on any other car or truck in a race  Outside if you like trucks  it s one of the most beautiful trucks I ve ever seen  The front foot room is large and would be big enough for a large sized man  In the back there is enough room for children or smaller adults  Overall this car is a great experience  the only disadvantage is parking this mammoth beast  Despite this fact I would recommend this car to anyone br br  
Pos, If you are someone who loves trucks but feel comfortable in a car as well  this is the truck for you  The Ford F 150 series has it all  They are very comfortable inside with features from basic vinyl and a radio to an extra port for utilities like a cell phone or a CD 6 speaker stereo  The ride is like being in a car instead of a truck because the suspension absorbs much of the bumps in the road  At the same time it can haul a truck load of rock and sand and still deliver control and smoothness The not so desirable features are that the side view mirrors are attached via plastic so they feel as though they are wearing out when you adjust the mirrors  Also  the standard and upgrade tires are a bit small for the muscular look of the body  Still  they do offer some nice alloy rims and good  long lasting tires Wether you are a mom  a single person  a business person  an outdoor person  construction worker  or a lover of trucks  you will be very pleased when you drive an F 150  You will want to recommend it to your friends and family  Take it from me  I have been in the Landscape Construction business for many years  this is the one  baby br br  
Pos, After driving a car for the past 30 years  I decided to buy a truck  I investigated the RAM  Chevy 1500  GMC  and the F150 The RAM looked pretty good to me  but after a test drive I felt the truck was put together rather cheaply  Plus the dealers were rude and didn t know too much about the truck at all The GM products also looked pretty good  For some reason they wanted more money for a truck that didn t stand up to the F150 The F150 is good looking  build to last  and it was affordable  The only thing that I wish I had done was to get the 4X4  But  that was another  4 000 00  Never owning a truck before I felt the 4X2 was a good enough start in trucks I bought the V6  It has more then enough horse power  It sits up tall and I feel level with many of the 4X4s  It feels great looking above all the cars on the road  I can see traffic problems much sooner then any car on the road The only problem that I have had is getting use to the rear wheel drive and the rather light rear end of a truck  Didn t hit anything  just some close calls  But  that would have happened with any truck I ve had the truck for about a year and 1 2 now  and I love driving the truck over any car br br  
Pos, I have had my 98 F 150 from the moment it hit the lot  Since then I have put over 102 thousand miles on it  I have traveled all over the country  but primarily from South Texas to Canada  through the Rocky Mountains  Colorado  Wyoming  etc  Driven in all possible weather conditions  I have changed the oil  and performed service checks every time it comes around  I was concerned with the new transmissions that were placed in this truck  but have seen no problems yet  Ford did a great job improving and modifying the 96 transmissions  Not once have I had a problem  A few weeks ago  I took apart the engine to check the wear  and there was little or none to be seen  I am greatly impressed with this truck  It is very stylish and had no defects  The paint is holding up greatly  unlike the 80 s Aerostars that came out  It has maintained its smooth ride  and still out performs most chevys and dodges  unmodified  I have noticed no decline in performance over the years  Acceleration has always been great  Stereo sound is not that bad  considering it is factory  With the way my truck is running  I am sure it will last at least 1 000 000 miles  
Pos, My husband comes from a Ford family  The only make of vehicle that they will buy is Ford  The majority of the cars we have owned are also Fords  Ford stands for stability and durability The Ford Taurus is a wonderful family car with plenty of leg room  The comfort for long trips is outstanding  Comfort should be the Taurus  middle name  The trunk space is more than large enough for luggage or groceries The car drives like a dream and is easy to steer  It provides a very smooth ride for short and long trips  As a mother of small children  I love that you can lock the windows and doors at the driver s side  The doors are easily locked and unlocked from the outside as well  With only 1 turn the driver s side door is unlocked  with 2 turns all doors are unlocked  I think this is a nice safety feature The car would make a wonderful car for anyone  The Taurus is well known for its safety  Besides being a wonderful family car  it looks more than nice enough for any business executive to drive as well  This is by far the best car that we have owned     
Pos, I own a 1998 Ford Taurus and I have been very pleased with it  I bought it in November of 1997 and haven t had an ounce of trouble with it  We bought this vehicle because I had previously been driving a Pontiac Grand Am and after the birth of our second child we decided that we needed more space  I am in my twenties and I wasn t ready to get  quot the family van quot  and felt that the Taurus looked sporty or  quot cool quot  enough but still served the purpose of a family car  Some of the many things that I love about this car is the stereo system the sound is great  The engine is quiet so quiet that one time when I was in a huge hurry I actually ran into a store and left my keys in the ignition and left the car running  I didn t realize until I returned to the car  thank goodness it was still there  that I had forgot to turn the car off  I also love how quickly the car cools off in the summer and warms up in the winter  We ve driven this car on 18 hour road trips and it has been a dream to ride in it s very comfortable whether you are the driver or the passenger  In my opinion  the person who would get the most pleasure from buying this vehicle is someone who wants a really good dependable car possibly with a family that doesn t want to buy a van or larger vehicle  It would also be perfect for a person who does a lot of travelling via automobile  For families with more than 2 children I would not suggest this car for them because the back seat would be too snug especially if your children are using car seats or booster seats br br  
Pos, Brown Wood Grain Siding  on a car  I know you remember those long brown station wagons  I learned how to drive in one of those station wagons  I referred to my parents car as the Tank  I have had my Taurus Wagon for two years now  The wagon seats 8 people  we have the third backwards seat I never thought I would see myself saying  quot Yes  I want a wagon quot  but I did  We were trading in our Ford Windstar mini van which I liked but really did not want another mini van when I began my search for the perfect wagon  We checked out the Camry but the drivers seat felt small and there was virtually no leg room for the middle seats  We still needed space  yet I didn t feel I needed to move around in it like you would in a van  Having three kids we felt we needed that third seat  The wagaon drives smoothly and I have not had any trouble at all with it  We take it in periodically for maintenance upkeep I absolutely love my car however  my husband feels a little cramped compared to the open feeling you have in a van  Otherwise he loves the smooth and quiet ride you get  Are kids have had one complaint  however  no cup holders  Once you get them use to a van with a cup holder in every corner it is hard to go back     
Pos, We have owned our 1998 Ford Taurus for nearly two whole years and have had absolutely no problems or complaints  I would definitely choose this model over any other Ford car product  especially a probe  The car has more power than you can imagine with a V6 installed  It will go from zero to sixty in just a few seconds  I have never rode in a faster car than this one  It is not even considered a sports car and still has the engine and a semi sporty type look  The car gets excellent gas mileage  too  On the highway it rides perfectly smooth without any bumps or loud  annoying noises that most cars make  It even has cruise control  I would be going 65 and let off the cruise control on the highway  and the car would still be between 60 and 65 for almost a whole entire mile  I thought this was incredible  It is comfortable for five and even six people to fit comfortably  The seats are very spacious and comfortable  especially in the back  I could live in the back of this car if I chose  there is so much room  The trunk is also full of vacant space as well  The front has an endless amount of compartments and unique options to make it easier for both the driver and passengers  It has airbags for both front seats to improve the safety  and also has air conditioning  You can add a disc changer to the car if you desire which would be very convenient because the receiver is programmed for this  You will just have to switch from radio to cd player and there is no hassle  Ford could have done away with their rather large  round receivers and installed a regular sized one which makes it easier to install your own cd player  but I guess a cd changer was a good idea  The Ford Taurus would be ideal for a large family of five  It is the perfect car for the cheap price that it is  It handles well in all four seasons  I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking at buying a car that will last a long while  It is worth a test drive or at least a look inside     
Pos, We are on our 4th Taurus  The 93 Sable 3 8l met it s fate during a winter storm and a tree  Wife walked away with a sore shoulder  We had 98k and no problems  I had a 92 Wagon with 182k and traded it in when I found the Mustang I wanted  My wife is on her 2nd  Gen3  The 98 DOHC is by far the best car we have ever owned  Plenty of power  great mpg  and enough room for our family of 4  With family 4 8 hours away and 2 small kids  road trip comfort is VERY important  The 2k model is by far the best refined edition of this car  The same basic chassis since its 1986 introduction  it is even used as the base for the Windstar  If we can afford it when we go for our next car  we will probably upgrade to the  Star br br  
Pos, My grandmother gave me this 1998 Ford Taurus brand new   a pleasant surprise and a wonderful blessing  It probably would not be one that I would have bought myself  but it has definitely been a good car  Shortly after I got it I moved up north and had to learn to drive in the snow  It was very reliable and I have since safely moved back home with not a ding on it  That was better than I hoped for  cuz I knew this southerner did not know a thing about driving in the white stuff   and there was a lot of it  too I have now had the car almost 3 years and in 42 000 miles its only been in the shop 2 times  I do not consider that excessive  One time was an ignition switch and the other was something with the power steering  The ignition problem was while it was still under the original warranty  The ignition switch problem did leave me stranded as it gave no warning   just died  But  since it hasn t happened again  I ve forgiven the car its indiscretion of breaking  The car has had reasonable gas mileage   about what it says on the sticker  I find it quite comfortable to drive as well  A Taurus is not a flashy car  but it is very utilitarian and that s good too  I think the trunk is a nice size I don t have a complaint in the world about this car for what it is   a car to get you around reliably  Its not sporty or anything  but it is a good car  
Pos, If you re in the market for a heavy duty pick up  I d like to offer you some suggestions  I have two Ford F350 Super Duties and have driven the Dodge Ram 2500  Based on my experience with these vehicles and others  here s what I think would be the ultimate truck It should be an extended cab  four door  long bed  diesel powered   manually shifted  3 4 ton    four wheel drive truck with shift on the fly  auto locking hubs  limited slip differential  four wheel anti lock disc brakes and powered drivers seat in a medium trim level  Here s why Extended cab   gives you comfortable seating for up to six adults  additional cab storage and is still maneuverable  When you go to the full crew cab   long bed version you loose big on maneuverability  70 80 ft  turning radius  and don t gain that much in seating and interior storage  If you are a contractor ferrying crews and equipment from job to job that s a different story Four doors   this is just a matter of convenience  Having had them I can t imagine an extended cab truck without them  Long bed   if you re buying a truck to haul cargo you ll want the 8 ft  bed  You ll never complain about the bed being too long  but if you go with the short bed  sooner or later you re there will be something that you can t haul  Another reason for the long bed is improved ride   the extra 18  or so of additional wheelbase length makes a big difference limousine effect Diesel powered   being underpowered is the last thing you want in a heavy duty truck  You put yourself and other motorists at risk if you can t keep up with the normal flow of traffic  Today s modern turbo charged  inner cooled  waste gated diesel engines are powerful  reliable  long lasting and efficient  You ll recoup most of your 4 or 5 grand initial investment at trade in  In the meantime  you ll be getting superior mileage and more raw torque than any available gas engine  and a 100 000 mile warranty to boot Manually shifted   for better control in adverse driving conditions  The auto shifters I ve driven have a time lag   especially when starting from a dead stop   when you push down on the accelerator before you start moving that is annoying and possibly unsafe  This lull protects the transmission from torque overload but also degrades drivability 3 4 ton   has a much smoother ride and has no effect on trailer towing ability versus a 1 ton truck  Again  if you re a contractor hauling heavy loads on the truck itself   go with the 1 ton Four wheel drive   versatility  go most anywhere and do most anything    a must have for mud or snow Shift on the fly   can t imagine having to stop in order to shift into four wheel drive  If you re in deep dodo you want to keep your momentum Auto locking hubs   you don t want to get out of the truck to engage the front hubs  see deep dodo above Limited slip differential   there s way to much power with the diesel motor to only drive one rear tire  In my opinion this is an absolute must Four wheel anti lock disc brakes   another absolute must  There s just no sense in not being able to stop your truck safely and controllably Powered drivers seat   enables a comfortable and safe driving position for various drivers  Shorter drivers especially will want this feature Medium trim level   you get a lot of convenience and appearance options for a small price  and increases resale value I hope this will be of help if you re considering purchasing one of these trucks  They are a considerable investment that you can t exchange once you drive it off the lot  Well  that s my epinion of the ultimate heavy duty truck  Why did I put it under the Ford F250 Super Duty category  Because  I think this vehicle   equipped as described above   is as close as you can come to the ideal truck br br  
Pos, I have a  99 4WD extended cab XLT with the gas V 10 engine  I have plenty of power to haul a 2700 pound camper I blow by those Dodge diesels chugging up the Rockies every day with this engine  I get up to 13 MPG without a load and down to 9 MPG loaded on mountain roads with the automatic  This is my first automatic and I must say it is very smooth  In 30 000 miles I ve had no problems and have visited the shop only for fluid changes and several recall notices  I have added extra overload springs as I felt the single factory springs that came with the camper package was not enough for the size camper I have on it  I would consider putting on larger tires when running at maximum gross vehicle weight like I do  although the stock aluminum rims with General tires still have about half the tread at 30M With the automatic and the on the fly 4WD switch I have even more room up front with nothing cluttering the floor  I d recommend the optional electric camper mirrors  This truck is a tight and smooth runner     
Pos, My family recently purchased a 2000 Ford F250 4 door  4x4  with the triton V 8 engine  I am extremely satisfied with this truck  The interior is very comfortable  and there is a lot of room  Many vehicles made today are based on economy  and are therefore made small  Not this truck  This truck is based on the old saying  quot Bigger is better quot  Even though the extra sizes makes it not that good on gas mileage  the comfort and style of it well makes up for that  It s towing  hauling  and plowing power is amazing  Some trucks are made for work  some trucks are made to look and ride nice  this is a work truck that looks and rides nice  I ve put the truck through it s hurdles  I ve tested the acceleration  the brakes  and the shocks many  many times  After running this truck up and down fields  through mud pits  and through the woods  I have come to the conclusion that this truck will not only take everything I through at it  but it will through it right back at me br br  
Pos, We have been a Ford family for the past 30 years  And will not change  The previous F 250 Ford Truck we owned had 300 000 miles on the engine before we traded it in for another Ford and the only reason we traded it in was  that it was not a 4x4  We were Truck hunting at Van Boxtel Ford in Green Bay during an ice storm  We spotted the Black 4x4  in there lot  it was in A 1 condition  Unsure  whether or not we would purchase another at this time  because our truck ran perfectly  we were going to leave and let them know what our decision was the next day  Well low and behold we could not make it out of there lot because of the ice  So we backed down to the door and purchased the new vehicle  That was 8 years ago and now we are at the 300 000 mile on this engine and have not had any problems with it nor does it use oil  Gas mileage is at 20 gallon and we sure can t complain on the comfort of the drive  We use this vehicle not only for recreation but as a work vehicle also  Another way to make sure your engines last is to do regular maintance and always use the same brand of oil and the same brand oil filter     
Pos, Headline  Avid Honda owner trades for All American made rear wheel drive After 9 wonderful years of Honda Accord ownership  I ll save that story for another Epinion  I traded in my Champaign colored 1989 Accord LX for a 4 6 liter V 8 equipped 1997 Thunderbird in early 1998  Ah  the car of my dreams  there are many  since my friend Mark Potter bought a 1986 Thunderbird back in 1988 I only paid a couple thousand more for the one year old T Bird than my new Honda back in  89  what a great deal  And this has been a FUN and reliable car  I feel spoiled by all that power spinning the rear wheels  And the optional traction control really works  you try to scoot the back end out from under you but you can t unless you push that little white button hidden in the console to defeat the system  However  in the rain you better watch out  the back end tends to slip during relatively slow turns when the road is slick I like power  but not for power s sake  I like knowing that I m able to launch up a freeway onramp without the fear that I won t be up to speed while merging with that big rig doing 70 MPH  This car gives you all the merging confidence you need with power to spare While you receive many benefits from having such a large power plant under the hood you sacrifice gas mileage in a BIG way  If you drive conservatively you may be able to wring 21 MPG out of a T Bird  But if your heavy foot wins over reason much of the time be prepared to give up more cash at the Shell station for that privilege to the tune of 15 or 17 MPG   or even less if you REALLY like racing The fit and finish of most American cars have been in question since the  70s so I was pleased to find that this car was well put together  Body seams are straight and even  and interior members are held in place with relatively few rattles  There are body flex noises at times  but in a car with such rigid construction something has to give Rigid construction is a major player in handling  And this T Bird handles well while flying low and straight on the freeway  and gets only a moderate rating in tight corners  Why  For a car this size it should be much lighter  it tends to push the front end while cornering and doesn t reassure the driver the way many lighter  front wheel drive cars flatly tackle tight turns  However  for such a beefy ride it eeks out adequate performance The maintenance has been quite minimal with the first major tune up due at 100K  I m only at 45K  Changing and checking the fluids are quite easy with Ford s signature yellow color coding under the hood helping you find all the different fluid intakes to keep your V 8 running smoothly   This car loves maintenance and pays you back with smooth performance I ve considered trading in this car for an SUV  but I can t seem to part with it  Whenever I get back in the drivers seat and fire up that big engine I m glad I have the power  luxury  comfort and security of a large American car FEATURES 4 6 liter V 8 Traction control ABS Factory alarm Moon roof Leather wrapped steering wheel Alloy wheels Power antenna Power drivers seat   
Pos, I never even gave a thought to drive any sort of Ford vehicle until it came time to replace my 1987 Subaru GL hatchback with 160 000 miles  There it was in the Capital District Auto Guide  staring me in the face  My Moonlight Blue Clearcoat Metallic 1995 Thunderbird  It just looked like a really sweet car  The color and the white letter tires on it did it  The right price  and the right mileage  38 000  ensured that my dad would be willing to co sign the loan  Two problems  rear wheel drive and 3 8 liter V6  We live in New York  I m a young kid and I ve only driven tiny Subaru s  but fortunately  he went for it anyway  I dragged my sister down to the dealership with me and we took it for a test drive  The dealer started it  and I was very enthusiastic about the sound of the engine  The car was beautiful  and kept very clean  I drove it and was amazed by the way it handled and the way it felt just to be in the driver s seat  Of course  it could have been because I d never driven such a powerful car before  and nothing newer than a 1990  my father s Daytona  I put a deposit down on the car that day  I went home  My dad said  it s cool  I took the next day off work and got insurance and purchasing matters taken care of  It was mine  I could pick it up that night If only the rest of the process had gone so smoothly  I couldn t pick the car up from the dealer for almost a week because there was  900 worth of work to be done to it  Why hadn t it been done before the car was put up for sale  I DON T CARE  I WANT MY T BIRD  GIMMIE  Finally I got the car and about a week later  the oil pressure gauge would slip down to 0 and the Check Gauges light would come on every time I stopped at a stoplight  Now  in my Subie s  the oil pressure would slip down at a stoplight  but the light would never come on  and it was normal  In the Thunderbird  the oil pressure gauge stood steadily in the middle all the time  And the light coming on caused me to have all sorts of worry  But besides that  it ran fine  I brought it into the shop and it needed a new oil pump  they said  I ended up in a rental car  driving an Escort  Wonderful  The car was supposed to be in the shop a week  but it was only there for three days  I went and got the car back and that night  sure enough  I stopped at a light on the way to work and the oil pressure went down to low and the light came on  I screamed and hit the horn    Then I drove to work and had it towed in  Of course  it got towed to the wrong dealership  Then  they found out that I had somehow blown a bearing in the crankshaft  I was none too happy to hear about that  But it was fixed for free  and I figured that if something else substantial happened to it  I could apply the Lemon Law to it but after that  it ran just dandy  I ve had a few problems with it  my gas line started to leak because it had been rubbing up against a sharp edge on the gas tank and it rotted  but this was covered by my warranty  the cruise control module broke  the windshield washer fluid no longer dispenses  and last but not least  one day I came back from lunch and went to shut the car off to find that the car WOULD NOT shut off  I had to have the battery disconnected and have it towed  Come to find out  some plastic pin had broken off inside the steering column  and I had to pay for just labor   And this was at the first day of my new job  Thanks  car  Not covered by warranty  Figure that one out  But after the pieces of doody I ve driven this stuff is all minor  Now the car has 78 000 miles on it  and I hope nothing else goes wrong with it  the warranty is up  I have taken this car on so many road trips it s amazing  I live in Albany  and I drive to Massachusetts all the time  I ve driven to Cape Cod twice  I drove to Manhattan once  And one time going to Cape Cod and the drive to Manhattan were both complete spur of the moment trips  I ve owned the car for almost two years now and put 42 000 miles on it  That s twice the average  Considering how much I drive this car and pound the doody out of it  the things that have gone wrong with it are pretty insignificant  It s a beautiful car  lots of potential for modifications  I only wish for a V8  leather  5 speed  and I think instead of buying a new car  I want to trade this in on a  97 with the V8 and leather  I put a Kenwood deck in it  all new Kenwood speakers in the doors and in the rear  I had the basic cassette tape player when I bought the car  and I thought it was terrible  a Kenwood changer in the trunk and 2 12 quot  JL Audio s and a Kicker amp in the trunk  Even with all that stuff in the trunk  I can still fit a good amount of groceries back there  And there s always the backseat  It s usually just me and Dave in the car  so I don t even worry about it  but I find that the backseat is pretty damn big compared to the Subaru s I ve driven and the Escort s and Sentra s you see all over the place  I have the 3 8 liter V6  and it s quick  but it could be a lot quicker  The  99 Jetta my dad s driving now is a lot quicker  But with the Thunderbird  highway driving is something else  It feels like you re at a standstill doing 80  I ve never had that before  It s one of the best feelings in the world  And speeding up on the highway is very effortless  I can make the tires squeal pretty easily  I love rear wheel drive  I just put studded tires on the back last winter and didn t have a problem at all in the snow  I didn t even have anything in the trunk except the speakers  I feel pretty powerful driving this beast  too  It s comfortable and the car is very responsive  I can take curves at a very scary speed  I got into an accident with this car  wrecked the front end on some poor kid s Saab in the rain while trying to merge  and when I drove the rental  Lumina  I noticed how badly it handled around curves  and then I realized that I d taken the Thunderbird s handling for granted  it handled a lot better than anything else I d driven I love this car so much  I really want a  97 with a V8 and leather  and I m not real thrilled about the job the body shop did on the front end  and I m also really scared because of all those head gasket horror stories but this car is like a part of me  I love being able to tell people that I drive a Thunderbird  And I want to be able to do that as long as possible  and I know I can t spend forty grand next year I also have turned into a car snob Because this car just screams  quot BEEFCAKE quot  while all these pimped out Honda Civics try to do the same but come on I give it a ten  Chuck Shame I can t post a picture br br  
Pos, I am very impressed with this large people hauler  The overall quality of this vehicle seems to be higher than what I have seen on GM and DC vans  First impressions  I knew at first these were large vehicles  I also knew that I would be hauling around 14 passengers  Scary thought at first  especially since I had never before had the chance to drive an extended version of the club wagon  Overall  I have to admit once I began driving this vehicle I fell in love with it  The interior of the van was rather quiet considering there were about a dozen people conversing  The ride was very smooth over all pavement except for on grooved pavement  Handling was good and the van seemed to hold to curves very well considering it s size  City driving also wasn t very hard  Only caution I have is to not cut your right turns to close or you ll go for a joy ride over the curb  Now that I have driven one and am a college student who hauls around a lot of stuff and people I am looking to purchase one of my own within the next year and a half  Why get one  Good towing capacity  hauling capacity  and people mover  And the biggest factor RELIABILITY on this van is great  I know many who have had great experience with the Ford Econoline  I only hope if I get one I have the same great experience br br  
Pos, I just graduated from college  moved to a new city  and needed a car  I didn t want very much  just a cheap car with good gas mileage  I was willing to sacrifice looks  endure insults from friends  even deal with some visits to the shop in short I would have settled for a Hyundai  Kia  or a Yugo if they still made them  I thought that with such standards finding a car would be easy  but as I did my research I realized that it wasn t The gas mileage most economy cars get was a big surprise to me  Considering the lack of size and horsepower that defines most economy car engines I expected my high gas mileage requirement to be easily filled however no car under  13K did that  Granted I want more than most people seem to from reading other opinions on numerous cars  I am fairly environmentally conscious and I would buy the Honda Insight in a second if I could afford it  I expected a car with at least 30 miles a gallon in the city and in the 40s on the highway  If you want that too don t bother looking under  13K  Echo  Corolla or Civic are your only options  about 33 city 41 high way  Golf and Jetta as well if you raise the price bar a bit more  Most economy cars are rated about mid 20s in the city and high 20s low 30s on the highway  I am not sure why people are impressed with this gas mileage my  92 Buick Skylark was getting about 22 30 and that thing is old  heavy  and had  I think  2 2L I4 that was definitely not multi valve  Some of my friends have SUVs that get low 20s high 20s  Anyway  another way to think about it  if the weight is light and the engine is small what accounts for gas mileage that is 30  less than something like a Corolla  I d call it bad engineering  May be engine timing isn t as good  may be compression ration is low  may be transmission sucks  Probably all of the above and more  I was seriously considering getting a Corolla   Echo gets expensive quick after you add some necessary  options  It is a great car  my dad owns one and I drive it a lot  Reliable  great resale value  great gas mileage  quiet  etc  I didn t really want to spend 13K though  I probably would have gotten one  or a Hyundai Accent  if my friend didn t work at Ford  Because I could get a good deal I decided to check out some Ford cars  I am not the biggest fan of Ford and even though I own one now I definitely can t say I trust it  But with dealer and factory incentives thrown in the Escort was the best deal I found  believe me  I looked at every economy car more times than I ever thought I d need to  and it is definitely one of the best looking compacts out there I don t want to bore you with the details of everything you get in this car  I would recommend that you go to the Ford site and check it out  But here is a short list of things that Escort had that many others didn t  rear defogger  yeah  really  15  tires  aluminum wheels  cassette deck  remote trunk  60 40 seats  spoiler  power mirrors  tachometer  intermittent wipers  etc  Also  you get keyless entry if you opt for the power group  In no other car I found do you get as much included and after all is said and done the car was less than 10500 withOUT the college rebate  i didn t end up using my friend at ford this was a lower a price than he could get I also think it is the best looking car under  13K and it holds its own for higher priced cars  Most people compliment me on the car and everyone thinks it cost a lot more  So I didn t have to deal with insults from friends after all    And it doesn t say Escort on it anywhere if you get the 2001 model I had the car for about 2 months and 2600 miles including some long road trips  One thing to note is that it is a four seater  There is no middle seat belt  Check the roominess stats on your favorite car web site it isn t much  even Corolla has more hip room in the back  but it is enough  Four people are comfortable and five people is manageable  There was no complaining from three passengers in the back after over eight hours in the car  and I got my share back there too Also  the trunk is small  Coupes are not hatchbacks  As far as trunk room you d do better with almost anything else  Echo  Focus  Corolla  Civic  except may be for the Accent  But again  I think the trunk is sufficient  5 people fit their stuff for a 5 days trip with no problems  including sleeping bags OK  now for actual driving The car is noisy  Perhaps not too noisy if you are used to driving Ferrari s but it is very noisy if you are used to Corollas  Noise is definitely hard to ignore if the radio is off it is virtually impossible  Having a conversation with someone is hard with normal voice  Road and wind noise are enough but the engine also makes a lot more noise after about 3000 RPMs  And then there is a lot more noise after about 5000 RPMs  My recommendation is test drive it  take it on the highway roll the windows up and see if its managable  Oh  turn the radio and the sales person off until you want them back on The engine is pretty fast and the tranny is responsive  Unfortunately this is my first manual transmission car so my opinion is fairly unsubstantiated  Somewhere I saw the acceleration stat of 0 60 in 7 8 seconds  It seems about right and this is fast for a compact  Its on par with cars like the Eclipse  The other day I left a 300ZX in the dust yeah yeah you don t have to tell me he was probably asleep  but it still felt nice  Seriously though  this car is fast enough to be fun  No old lady will pass you as you are trying to merge You will need to shift a little more the gear ratio is definitely shifted to the low end  Expect to shift out of first almost immediately and expect to be in 5th at about 45  if you want power though 2nd gear will carry you into the 60s  Oh and a huge disappointment to me the transmission is not overdrive  It is listed as overdrive on a number of websites and I thought it was but it isn t  Expect about 3000RPMs at 70mph  My guess is this is largely responsible for low gas mileage  reported 27 33 although I ve been getting more like 24 29 though its still early to count As far as raw speed passing power  Rest assured there is enough of it  I was a little concerned with the engine being at 3000RPMs at 70mph but there is no reason to be  I trust you ll keep this a secret but on a recent road trip I took the car up to about 110mph with a full trunk and 5 people in the car  And the engine was still comfortable at around 5000RPMs  red line is at 6500  Assuming there is no governor on it this car will easily top out the speedometer  120  Now the point isn t that you should drive that fast  the tires are only B rated   but to convince you that there is plenty of extra power to pass even at high speeds As far as reliability I still don t really trust it  It doesn t really feel like a solidly built car although I am sure  don t know though  that it compares very well with cars in the 10K range  And supposedly the reliability ratings for new escorts have been decent  One example of questionable cost cutting is that the alternator is rated at 48AMPS and is a heavy duty model  Most cars  in fact all other cars I saw  use at least an 80AMP alternator  Odds are the thing will need replacement early especially if you are using lots of utilities on the car I think this review is getting pretty long but hopefully I gave you more than a re listing of features you can find anywhere else  For the money it was a good car  I sacrificed gas mileage and reliability to get this deal  If those things are very important go with a Corolla or a Civic you will make up the difference in price when you sell  I checked blue book values  If you want bottom priced car and can get this car for around  11K without options I think you are getting a better deal than you would with an Accent or a Kia Rio  If above else you want a good looking car with some pep for cheap this is definitely among the strongest contenders especially if they offer  1500 back again  However  if you see yourself spending  13K or so on this car I would definitely say give some other cars a very close look Another thing to remember is that this is either the last year or close to it for the Escort  The Focus is replacing this car and the ZX3 has the same engine but is a much better overall car  Without cash back the two cars cost almost the same  
Pos, About 6 months ago  I purchased a brand new 2001 ZX2 right off the lot  and since then I ve learned a whole lot about cars  including one thing  This car tricked me into buying it  It has a sleek  sexy exterior  as well as a playfully agressive stance that looks very sporty and fast  The interior has very comfortable seating  and the 4 cyl Z Tech engine peels this little car off the line every time you floor the gas  But if you re looking for a contender in the sports car class  this isn t it  Don t let it trick you too  Those of you who are interested in building a hot street racer or just tricking out your car for fun should definately get this car  There is room for improvement in all areas  and if you re seen driving this car with some hot ground effects on it  you ll definately turn heads  because not many parts are out for the ZX2  If you really want something that can talk the talk and walk the walk from off the lot  then you might want to consider another car  such as the VW Jetta or the Honda Prelude  However  if you re looking for a beautiful and affordable ride that looks and feels sexy and sporty  but won t get you a ticket  this is the car for you  I bought the ZX2 because  at the time  I just wanted something new  fully loaded  and affordable  and this is what I ended up with  In retrospect  I would have much rather invested my money in something with less extras and more horses  If the Ford Mustang were a bar of soap  the ZX2 is what it would look like after about 10 uses  I think everyone looking for a new  sporty and affordable car should at least give the Escort a test drive  It s such a well rounded 4 banger for the price that it s hard to form an opinion for or against the car  You ll just have to go see for yourself  
Pos, I ordered my ZX2 on Jan  22 before I read the opinions already written  I now have around 2 000 miles on it and I really like the car a lot I was ready to hate the car because it took 10 weeks from day of order to day of delivery  I was also prepared to be disappointed in the performance of the car because I read some of the negative comments on this page  Neither have been the case the car is a 4 speed with cruise control which works extremely well even on hills  I ve been driving small Fords since 1972 when I got a Pinto and have gone through the Pintos and the Escorts ever since  This car is as good or better than any of the others that we ve owned  It s fun to drive very comfortable for the two of us that own it and use it  It wouldn t be a good choice for a family only seats 4 but it does have a good sized trunk  My gas mileage is regularly in the 30 mph range  I do a lot of short trips and a few 100 mile trips and the mileage has been around 30 every time we ve filled it  I didn t get the cd in it  just the radio and cassette player so have no problem with a cd changer in the trunk  It does step right out when you want to go unlike some cars that take forever to reach the 65 speed limit on our expressways  The only problem I have at this time is that we can t find a good place to mount the  deer whistlers  that we put on all of our vehicles  I ended up paying a little under  14 000 for the car with cruise control  comfort group which included air conditioning  and the power package which gave me power windows  door locks and keyless entry  That was after a  1500  Ford rebate  I haven t even found any little things that require taking it back to the dealer like you usually do when you buy a new car  or used one for that matter  
Pos, Due to the many emails and enquiries I have had concerning my original Epinion on the 89 Ford Probe  I am writing an update to that Epinion  For some reason Epinions won t let me edit my old Epinion  and so I am writing a new one  The old Epinion can be found at  http crimson epinions com auto review 1F78 E3A62CD 382F40DA bd3 It s now been a year since I wrote the first epinion on my 89 Ford Probe  and I would like to say that the car is  still  running great  although I have had to do a few more repairs  The car is nearly 12 years old now and I have had it for 6  It s now got near enough to 180 000 miles  The Body is still solid and showing very few signs of rust  although the Ohio weather has not been great on some of the underside  The brakes have started making horrid noise in reverse and I haven t yet been able to figure out why even though I have changed all the brakes The other problem that has recently cropped up is with the factory CD player and stereo  The lights in the lcd radio display have burned out and the CD player is being less than cooperative these days  It seems that the CD player uses a plastic gear system to pull the CD in and out of the player and I believe that a few cogs have broken off of the gears  Sometimes the CD will not go all the way in and begins to make an awful clicking sound I think that the lazer is near to burning out as well  It tends to skip alot easier these days  However the stereo is a minor detail and really  I m quite surprised it has lasted this long The original factory paint has faded a good deal as well  The roof of the car has become somewhat dull over the past few years and the paint seems to be rather thin up there by now I don t know that this is due to poor craftmanship or whether it s due to Ohio s harsh weather I still highly recommend the 1989 Ford Probe however because of the general reliability of the car and the lack of major repair work that I have had to do on it  I recently drove the car all the way to Chicago from Ohio and this was a 7 hour drive and we spent a good hour and a half sitting in a traffic jam the car did not overheat at all and we made it nearly the entire way on one tank of gas I didn t have to fill up till we got within 20 minutes of Chicago  and if it weren t for the huge traffic jam  we probably would have made it all the way without needing to fill up again br br  
Pos, I bought my 1990 Ford Probe LX  3 0L V6  about 4 years ago  Since then I ve had to replace the brakes  front rotors  the radiator and a few radiator hoses  a power steering hose  and the rear wiper motor  Also  it is in need of some new injectors  It now has 125k miles  These are all expected normal wear and tear items  The motor and transmission have been ROCK SOLID  The 3 0L is a really tough motor no wonder it is in just about all the other Fords  Ranger  Taurus Sable  Aerostar Windstar  Tempo Topaz  and the Mazda pickups  The Manual transmission is very strong and it shifts very smoothly and is the perfect match to the 3 0L V6 motor  Handling on snow and ice are pretty good if you are careful   studded or all season tires help tremendously  I basically have no problems dropping a gear and passing people if I have to  There is PLENTY of trunk space under the hatch and good space up front  however typical of a car like this the rear seats are fairly cramped  The perspective from the drivers seat is excellent  You can raise or lower your seat with the automatic controls on the side as well to help with visibility and comfort  I really like being able to see the hood when I drive as well as the pop up headlights  good for aiming the car down the road All of the power options are nice  Power windows  power steering  power seats  power mirrors  power antenna  etc  Anti lock brakes come in handy on ice believe me  I KNOW living in Alaska  For you gear heads into modifying cars the 3 0 seems to be very responsive  I installed a cat back exhaust w high flow muffler  and a K N Filter  The thing growls and rumbles alot like a V8  Suprises alot of Honda and other 4 cyl owners out there  Cars that I owned previous to this one  1985 Ford Escort  1987 Toyota Celica GT  1991 Toyota Celica GT S  1991 Nissan 240SX  1991 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS  
Pos, Now first off my title might be a bit misleading  Owning an Escort doesn t make you spoiled by any means  Its not like my parents went out and bought me luxury car or anything  As a matter of fact my parents didn t go out and buy me anything  I bought it myself  and I also make my own insurance payments  I am not looking for wide spread acclaim by stating that just that I am not a materialistic suburban brat   Now to the car b I love my car   The ZX2  I own the four door model which is quite different than the ZX2 pictured by opinions  Mine is actually the exact car they show in the 1998 escort picture only mines a  99  The ZX2 is a two door model that has more of a pinched tail end  and a bit more of a bullet shape overall  It s the  sporty Escort  My best friend owns a ZX2 and she couldn t be more pleased with it  Although its not the car of her dreams it is still her baby  and she couldn t be happier   The Sedan  Most people don t associate a  real  car with the Escort name  I have heard time and again  Wow Escorts have changed this is like i a car i  Now as intellectual as this comment might sound it is all to true Up until recent years Escorts have been cheep looking hatchbacks  The Escort of today has a much larger body and a spacey interior  The sad news is that you can say goodbye to the sedan  After 1999 they are being replaced by the Focus which is an equally cute car if you ask me  But the Escort legacy isn t going to dye so soon  Ford is planning on keeping the ZX2 around for a while b My ties to the Escort  This is my third Escort  Yes my third  When I first got my license I drove around in the car my step grandmother had driven since she bought it brand new in 1982  Ha  Yes  I drove an 1982 manual Escort with no air conditioning  or any other perks for that matter including a radio  Not to mention the 250 000 miles it had racked up  But that was just fine  I loved it because it was a car  it was  my  car  However  it started to encounter some mechanical problems  finally  and we  The  rents and my self  thought best if I got a bit newer car because they didn t want me to be a 16 year old female stranded on the road somewhere  So I went with them to get a newer car  We got a 1994 Escort  This one had air  a CD player  power mirrors  and power seatbelts so I did manage to get some more stuff  That was a plus but not necessity  I grew to love that car  I really did  The only problem it has was one of the speakers had been blown out by the previous owner  But the problem was solved when I asked my mom buy me speakers for Christmas  Then the next problem came my CD player died  I was able to pick up a Pioneer flip face CD player  nice stuff  at Best Buy on Sale  It cost me 250  but it was nice  and it has and will last me for quite some time  For a surprise my mom paid for that for my birthday though  She didn t have to and I told her that  But she did and I love it  And those were the only two problems I ever had with the car  Just the audio system  Other than that I loved it and it loved me  However  a couple of months back I learned the inevitable lesson that you can t drive through other cars  And I lost my car to the  totaled  gods  Because I bought the car so cheep  I worked my finagling powers  I ended up making a bit of cash off the wreck  Because when the car is totaled the insurance company gives you market value of the car  So after a month of no car I went on a search for another car  With the money I had made off the accident I was able to spring for a nicer car  Although I was looking at 1997 s originally  I realized that I could spend about the same for a 1999  At the time I thought I had a job that was an hour or more away so I sprung for the  99  Again I love my car  I have an automatic  remote keyless entry  power mirrors and all that fun stuff  I honestly love my car  and better yet  I was able to get the old speakers and CD player installed into the new car  So everything is great  Mechanically the car is wonderful b My friends do it so should I  All of my friends sadly own Escorts  It is a very practical car for a teenager to drive  They are cheep  have great gas mileage  cheep to insure I mean come on how perfect is that M  drives a 98 ZX2  so far no problems and no costs outside of gas and oil changes  L  owns a 97 four door  so far no problems and no costs outside of gas and oil changes  J  owns a 93 two door so far only problem was when car was side swiped and insurance paid for the fixing  out side of that no costs outside of gas and oil changes  Me and L  own  99 four door sedans  surprise  surprise  so far no problems and no costs outside of gas and oil chnges  B  owns a  95 Neon poor  poor B  has had to put her car in the shop for the  check engine light  poor  poor girl she should have bought an Escort b The car I haven t told you about the car  What is there to say  I have no complaints  It says something that I have gone out and bought two of the same car  It says something that the 1982 Escort with 250 000 miles was still going  Fords have a bad rep  with some people  Maybe they have been burned before  but I am happy as a pig in mud  I could sit here and tell you that the car has decent pick up  I can tell you that I have had nothing but success  I could even tell you about how comfortable the seats are but I think the fact that so many are on the road lets the car speak for itself   Have you driven a Ford lately b br br  
Pos, My husband and I were looking for a new vehicle our first  and decided on a Ford Escort  The price was right between eleven and twelve thousand dollars  and the four doors are appropriate for a family of four  The back seat fits 2 car seats  but not much else  Trunk space is great if you are going on a nearby vacation or camping somewhere  It fits a stroller  diaper bag  and other baby supplies beautifully  Driving is smooth  but the passengers feel all bumps  The one thing I really dislike about my car is the engine noise is extremely loud  You hear every little shift and brake the car makes  One of the bonuses though is the power brakes  steering  windows and doors  There is expandable leg room for the front  and the bucket seats also recline  I really feel this car is great in price  size  and comfort for new parents  I love to drive my car  and with 2 kids  everything seems to fit well into the trunk for long trips to the grocery store or Grandma s house     
Pos, About a year and 1 2 ago my motor went in my 1990 Cavalier  So I started to look for a used car  I was looking for something a little sporty but reasonable to afford  Because my kids are older and have their own cars now I do not need the old fashion station wagons to cart them and their friends around in  I looked at many models and at many dealers  I found a few to be at my interest  After review loan and interest with banks I found that buying a brand new car my payment would be fairly close to the payment for a used car  I decided at that point to look at the 1999 Escorts  I went to the dealer and the model that was in the show room was an awesome color  very sporty looking  It didn t have all the option I was looking for so the dealing order up the parts and had the options added  I took it for a test drive and bought it  I never had a brand new car before so this was very exciting  I have it it for one year now and I love it  It has power locks  sunroof  rear spoiler  mag wheel and lots of power  I would just like you all to know before purchasing a used car and someone else s headache check into what it will cost you to buy a brand new one  It s well worth the feeling of owning a brand new one br br  
Pos, I recently purchased a 1999 Ford Escort  The company handled my questions quickly and efficiently My car was and is a great buy  It gets great mileage and a full tank usually costs around  11 00 with gas prices being  1 21  The Escort is a nice economy sized car and is excellent for the whole family  The back seat can be pulled down for more room for larger things  The trunk is midsize and can fit almost anything  The crash rating is high  I had a little fender bender and Ford fixed it quickly in a week or less  The sound system makes you feel like you are there at a concert  Even better is that some Escorts have a 6 cd changer in them Problems with the Escort is the bumpy ride  I am used to bigger cars  this is quite a change  More noise retention is needed with this car  This car is small and along with it come small shocks  The tire rims always need cleaning  I can clean them and go driving for an hour just to come back and have them dirty again  The windshield wipers wash the rain off but some of it stays on the side of the window  The wind pushes you around also and can be scary at times This is a great car  I bought it because I like small cars and I feel safe in it  The drive  once you get used to it  is nice br br  
Pos, I am 19 years old and have had my ZX2 for a little over a year  I m happy to say that it has proved to be quite reliable  When I went looking for my first car my father and I looked at every conceivable small car on the market  Tercel  Corolla  Civic  Protege  Contour  Mirage  Saturn SL2  and Sentra  Except for the Saturn all of these small cars were excellent  The Saturn is sold by great dealers  but the car itself is unrefined  So why did I buy the ZX2  Well  first off the ZX2 had the most horsepower  130  Only the Contour with the V 6 had more  170  Also I had just read an article in the May 1997 issue of Car and Driver in which the ZX2 came in first place when compared to other small coupes  Moreover  Consumer s Reports had rated the 99 model at above average reliability  something that other domestic sedans  Cavalier and Neon  could not say  But enough with the boring stuff what the car is like in action is what convinced me to buy  Performance  I can t say enough about this car s acceleration  but 0 60 in 8 0 seconds should sum it up pretty well  The car has plenty of power in 5th gear  therefore when I want to pass on the parkway a downshift into 4th is not needed  There are some drawbacks to this engine though  It is kind of noisy at speeds above 3 000 rpm  but that s O K  most small 4 cylinders are  More annoying is that when the A C is on the compressor is always cycling  turning on and off  and it makes it feel as though the car has misfired  However  after reading some newspaper articles about the ZX2 it turns out this is normal  Ford intended the A C to cycle to save gas  Once the engine gets this car moving the suspension does not let you down  The handling is awesome   This car inspires confidence in the driver  and the tires have never squealed on me yet  The ride is pretty good too  Most of the large potholes are absorbed well  and the suspension makes a nice thud noise  Braking is O K  My car is equipped with ABS  but the brakes don t have an initial grippy feel Interior  The seats are nicely shaped up front  and the back seat is not bad for hauling around friends  I just recently completed a two hour road trip  and the car proved comfortable coming and going  The cruise control keeps the set speed very well  The factory installed power moon roof has never leaked  No problems with the power windows  locks  or keyless entry  I did have an after market CD player put in the dash  and because of the oval pod I had to pay  50 to get a special faceplate  Overall  I am very pleased with my decision to buy the ZX2  There are times  however  when I would have liked to have the extra two doors of a sedan  but whenever I long for those two doors the admiring looks I get from other drivers in their dowdy sedans  SUVs  and minivans always changes my mind  Not to mention the internal joy I get when I drive this car  IT IS JUST PLAIN FUN     
Pos, The ZX2 seems to be breaking away from the overall  quot Escort quot  category  While there is still a small  quot Escort quot  on the back  there is a large ZX2 in script on the rear window  rear bumper and on the backs of the front seats  And there s a good reason for this This isn t an Escort  It s more like a slightly smaller Probe  The engine is a Contour engine so it has a bit more getup and go  It still pulls a bit too much RPM when you floor it  but it s better than a Plymouth Breeze or Dodge Stratus  Inside there is surprising room  I m 6 5 quot  tall and I actually have headroom  Shoulder room is a little less  But it s less in everything but the most  quot luxury quot  cars these days  There actually seems to be more leg room than there is in the Taurus  The car looks sporty  Which is something you can t say about any of the other Fords  save the Mustang  And the Mustang has rear wheel drive and costs a couple grand more  The car does sit a little higher off of the road than most sporty vehicles  It handles well but doesn t quit stick to the corner  Gearing is good  The automatic transmission is smooth  The model I purchased came with everything  Power windows  power doors  a 6 cd changer  power mirrors  anchored floor mats  fancy wheels  larger tires  tilt steering wheel and the price tag was still around  16K  To get the same ammenities on any other car I looked out would have taken the price over the  20K mark  The seats are nicely designed  but slightly small  If you re not over 6  and not over 200 lbs you probably won t notice this  The sound system is excellent  Other controls are easy to reach  Though the horn needs to be a little more sensitive  Outside mirrors are adequate  though they seem a bit chintzy  They do the job  But that s all  The cabin is a bit noisy during acceleration  but about what you d expect for a subcompact with a bigger than normal engine in it  Cornering in normal driving is good  but sharp cornering is not quite what it should be     
Pos, Ok  anyone who is looking for a car under 17 000 that is a coupe  should take a look at the Ford Escort Zx2  This car has a lot to offer including exceptional power  a 130HP Ztech engine  The Automatic will cost more  but I think it is funner to drive  Lets hope that Ford dosent discontinue this nice car It has improved so much over the years  I had a Mercury Tracer before and I loved it  I love my ZX2 more though  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quality made car thank you Ok  anyone who is looking for a car under 17 000 that is a coupe  should take a look at the Ford Escort Zx2  This car has a lot to offer including exceptional power  a 130HP Ztech engine  The Automatic will cost more  but I think it is funner to drive  Lets hope that Ford dosent discontinue this nice car It has improved so much over the years  I had a Mercury Tracer before and I loved it  I love my ZX2 more though  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quality made car thank you   
Pos, We just bought a ford explorer and got rid of our old escort and then kept our camry had 115000 miles on it while the escort had only 60000 what a mistake that was  the camry pooped out on us Now don t get me wrong the camry was a great little car well mid sized car but it had a lot of miles and needed a new trans  and the engine was soon to come We decided instead of getting all that replaced we would just get a new car We decided on another escort We needed something to balance everything out so to speak We have a big gas guzzling roomy dependible explorer  now we needed a not so roomy  fuel efficient just as dependible car we had had great luck with the old escort and we decided once again to get one This one would be a sedan lx with a standard trans It proved to be a great little car  the explorer is our vacation daily driver  the escort is our around town daily driver  The biggest problem is that it is a little underpowered  no pick up at all Another one is the seats are not very comfy and it is cramped front and back We have had no troubles at all with this car If you are looking for a fuel efficient VERY dependible car the ford escort is for you br br  
Pos, I bought the 1999 Ford LX in November of 1998  I was looking for a dependable small car with a reasonable price  I have not been disappointed with the car itself  I have 25 000 mile and it runs like a dream  I took a trip from South Dakota to Mississippi this summer  2300 miles  and was very comfortable the entire trip  The car is great  However  the service has NOT been so great after purchasing I noticed a flaw in the window molding  I reported to Ford when they did the Customer Satisfaction phone call  I was told to take to my local dealer where I had purchased the car  I was told they would fix it but could not right now  I have called a few times to see when it would be fixed and have been given no time that it can be taken care of  I am a easy person to deal with but the noise from the window may change that pretty soon  The Ford Escort is a good car for average size people I would not recommend this car for larger people  My wife is 5 2 quot  and loves the way it handles and that she can see over the steering wheel  I will purchase another Ford in the future IF the follow up service is improved     
Pos, I purchased a 1999 Ford Escort SE in September  I had a Ford Escort years ago  got good mileage and very few repairs so I decided I wanted another one  This car is comfortable  gets good gas mileage  sporty  amp  attractive  I like the cruise control something I never had on a car  The rear defrost is a must and of course  air conditioning  It has an excellent heater  I love the color red the car really stands out  It has plenty of leg room and it is a perfect buy for me  I think anyone would enjoy driving this car especially students and retired people  It is economical and yet attractive  So far I haven t found anything I don t like about this car  Anyone who is used to a Lincoln probably wouldn t be suitable for this car  I purchased the 4 door which has a reclining back seat which makes it nice for hauling mostly anything within reason  I would buy this vehicle again  Ruth Anna Rote   
Pos, In June of 2000  my 1989 Mercury Tracer finally kicked the bucket  That was a two door coupe which was basically a big  red  problem  So off I went  carshopping with my father  I trust his opinion  and knew he d help me choose a good car   Besides  I had learned the hard way that car salesmen ignore solitary women I shopped alone  read  Consumer Reports  faithfully and followed their Reliability Charts on used cars  I noted that the Escort s reliability had improved drastically over the past ten years  I began looking toward an Escort being an economical solution to my dilemma  And then  tired of being ignored and treated like a  stupid woman  by salesmen  I asked my dad to go with me We chose the 1999 Ford Escort SE  in silver  And I cannot say enough good things about it  I adore it  My son  who is 2  still refers to it as  Mommy s New Car  even though I ve had it for nearly seven months now  The four door Escort is a practical family car  for me with just one child  which gets excellent gas mileage  I have had no major problems with it  and no costs except gas and oil changes  Oh  wait  I did have  one  cost  I had one flat tire  due to the fact that there is always construction going on  and almost always near someplace I need to be  I have only had one minor problem with the tape player  Yes  I said tape player  The car was  and still is  under factory warranty  so off I went back to the dealers  to get it fixed  And I was an even happier camper The only drawback to the Escort lies not with the car  but with me  I am not used to owning a car as new as this one  so I am sure the salesman who helped me as well as the automotive department is probably tired of seeing me  Every little noise  and back I went  I was fearful of something major going wrong  as it had with my Tracer  Nothing is wrong with the car  I was  and still am  a paranoid new car owner  
Pos, I owned an Escort several years ago  and I didn t care for it mainly because of a bad 3 speed transmission  But now  with the new Escort  it s like a totally different car  I considered this car  at first  mostly because of the price  I purchased this new Escort a couple months ago I already have 10 000 miles on it  and it is the best compact I have ever had  The engine is quite fast and the features for the price are out of this world  I have air  automatic  power locks  power doors  power mirrors  rear defrost  car alarm  etc  It is the best equipped car for the price  I checked out a Saturn  Cavalier  Honda Civic  Hyundi  Dodge Neon  etc  and nothing came with the features and a better price  It has a smooth shifting transmission and the handling is top notch  The only shortcomings are stiff seats go for the extra comfort seats Otherwise  I have no complaints  If you need a small car and you are on a budget  you can not beat this car  It is also well reviewed by other consumer mags  so ask around and you will see that everyone loves this little car  Ford was actually going to discontinue the Escort  but with the new design  it has been a huge success and they are keeping it  Buy it now br br  
Pos, You heard it from Coach back in high school  Your golf or tennis pro says it today  You hear the same thing from your kid s martial arts instructor   You can t reach your full potential without being tested by competition  A case in point  for twenty five years  Ford s F 150 has been the undisputed king of the road  outselling every competing light truck on the road  For eighteen of those years  the F 150 outsold every single vehicle on the road  passenger cars and SUVs included  But perhaps Ford became a bit complacent  for   after its 1996 update  the F 150 slowly lost ground to GM s Silverado twins and the Dodge Ram  Updates to those two  1999 for the Silverado  2002 for the Ram  further encroached on the F 150 s lead  but the biggest scare for Dearborn came in 2000  when Toyota morphed its undersized T100 into a true full sized truck  the Tundra  Combining the nearly legendary reliability of Toyota s truck line with a full size truck was certain to take a bite out of Ford s sales   and slip they did  Adding more fear and loathing is the promise of another Japanese full size entry   the Nissan Titan  promised for this model year  Ford couldn t help but hear ever louder footsteps Fortunately for the folks at the blue oval  a rebuild from wheels to the tip of the antenna was in the cards for the 2004 model year  and   faced with slipping sales of 2003s   Ford rushed the redesigned F 150 into production  The first models rolled out in mid summer  and are sitting on showroom floors now  The big question is   Did the competition bring out the best in the F 150 b What Was  Wrong  with the F 150 b On the face of it  not a thing was really  wrong  with the  a href content 109971934852 2003 F 150 a  a vehicle that came in so many configurations and trims that the only thing they seemed to have in common was a grille shaped like a Cameron Diaz smile  It s that the competition  especially the Tundra  had started doing things better  Ford s 1996 redesign of the line stuck with a clunky dual leaf spring rear suspension that  while friendly to full loads of cargo  is less kind to passengers  kidneys  Then  too  Ford saddled the 4200 pound truck with a standard 4 2 liter V6 so under powered  202 hp  that a basic model couldn t outrun its own shadow  And when you come right down to it  eight years is a long time to go without a redesign  even for trucks  vehicles that generally have precious little wiggle room for design But change they did  the company boasts that they ve touched on every system in the vehicle in an effort to make the 2004 redesign total   and from where I sit  it looks like they have  But again we must ask   Did they do the job  Let s look and see b First  Let s Talk Choices  Truth be told  the F 150 comes in so darned many configurations that it s easier to describe with a set of matrices than it is to list  em all  But I can t draw a matrix here  so let me break it down this way i Drive Train i  2WD or 4WD i Trim Levels i  Five  from the base XL  STX  XLT  FX4  and Lariat i Cab Configurations i  Three  Regular  not available in Lariat trim  SuperCab  and SuperCrew  not available in XL and STX i Bed Length i  Three  5 5   not available on regular cab  6 5   not available on SuperCrew  and 8   not available on SuperCrew i Body Style i  Two  Flareside and Styleside  availability dependent on both cab configuration and bed length Whew  I think that makes forty seven different combinations  but I lost count somewhere in the bed lengths  Those are just the basics   of course Ford offers the truck in eleven different colors and with two different standard engines and two transmissions  You can also purchase special towing packages  including an obstacle sensing  radar  system for the rear  and a snow plow package for your 4x4  This vehicle is in no way a purchase for the decision challenged person  Me  I just took the first truck I happened upon in the dealer s lot  an STX 2WD SuperCab with the standard 4 6L engine and a couple of options  cruise control and the towing package  For those of you keeping track  it was black with a gray  technically   medium flint  interior b Looks Count For Something  Face it  A truck is a truck is a truck  From the outside  at least  a pickup is just a naked box on wheels with a bit of covered space where a driver can sit  Except for the badging and taillight shapes  pickups are fairly hard to tell apart in silhouette   though from the front  the grille shape quickly gives  em away  Still  Ford has managed to apply some cosmetic changes to the previous version  resulting in a model that s distinguishable even to one who s not a Ford enthusiast Compared to the previous model  a walkaround will show that Ford has dumped the raked  streamlined shape of the front end that was so reminiscent of early Taurus models  Instead  they ve essentially recreated the body style of the F 150 s beefier siblings  the F 250 and F 350  Up front the headlights are more squared  and that grinning grille takes a bite out of the leading edge of the hood  In fact  the hood now  includes  the grille  which may come as a painful surprise for tall owners the first few times they check their crankcase oil  Stroll down the length of the body  and you ll note that all F 150s now have a notched front window like the big guys  and the door handles aren t the old Ford ovals but beefy looking square pads with wraparound handles  Further back  flares on the rear fenders have a flat strip integrated at their outer edge instead of the smooth curve of last year s F 150  This latter is very noticeable on the flareside  which is pretty much the same idea as Chevy s stepside bed  Naturally  the tail end has undergone a little change  too   mostly in the shape of the taillights  They re slightly shorter and wider than in the previous design  and the hideous teardrop shaped lenses on the flareside have been dropped in favor of the same light housings used on the styleside  BTW  while I once called the flareside s taillights the ugliest ever mounted on a pickup truck  that was before I saw the lights on a Tundra  stepside  All tailgates are removable and locking  and I found them surprisingly light for a hunk of metal that large  this may be the  tailgate assist  feature  which no salesman could explain  By the way  the cargo boxes are now two inches deeper than before   the side rails are a whopping 54 inches off the ground Now  go back toward the front and open the doors  And keep opening doors  In a definite coup for Ford  every last F 150  regardless of cab configuration or trim level  has four doors  Even a Regular Cab boasts a pair of skinny rearward opening doors for improved access to the enlarged cubby behind the front seat s  Did Ford do the job  Yes to the four doors  no to the body  redesign   cheaters b Notes From the Interior  Ford lavished more attention to the interior of the F 150  With as much landscape as is available there   what  an acre or two  they had plenty of room to play  All basic amenities are present  standard AC  dash mounted cupholders  with more in the flip down console for bench seats  a pair of power points  one on the passenger side of the dash  and a surprisingly puny glove compartment  Map pockets are incised into all doors  with integrated cutouts in the front doors for bottle holders  Where Ford seems to have paid the most attention is not in design  although it s certainly changed  but in materials  While lower end models  like the 2003 STX Sport I drove last month  were once slathered with cheesy looking plastics  the materials in the 2004 have a more solid look  They feel solid  too  and the model I drove had even better build quality than that 2003   already good Power windows in both the front and rear  for SuperCrew and SuperCab  are standard in XLT  FX4  and Lariat trims but in the XL and STX trims the rear windows are fixed  they don t even tilt out  The cab s rear window can be ordered as a slider in any cab and trim  a powered slider is optional in the top three XLT  FX4  and Lariat trims offer a nifty optional  Overhead Rail  system that lets ceiling mounted storage and A V goodies move front to back  it s unavailable on the XL or my STX  The rails  which include transmission of power for a DVD screen or speaker and climate controls  are finished in brushed aluminum   they re incompatible  however  with the optional power moonroof Did Ford do the job  No question about it  yes b Driving Interface  Oh  yeah  the cab  is  about an acre in area   large enough that for average sized me  reaching some controls even in the center of the dashboard was a bit of a stretch  If a potential driver is on the short side  you may wish to spring for the optional power adjustable pedal cluster  standard on Lariat  All trims and cabs have tilt steering  an instrument panel with speedometer   odometer   fuel   voltmeter   temperature gauges  and manual lumbar support  The breakover point for cushiness appears to be between the STX and the XLT  the upper three trims have a standard tach  power front and rear windows  and cruise control  the two lower trims have optional cruise control Climbing into the cab is made a bit easier by a pair of grab handles  though I found them located awkwardly far to the front  Once seated high above the madding crowd in the cab  you ll find that for the most part the instrument panel is well laid out and intuitive  I found the standard bench seat a bit deep  and it could use a little more contouring to the average posterior shape  as it s rather flat  The large steering wheel makes reaching left hand controls and the ignition a little tough  occluding both wiper and light controls  The sound system controls are high on the dash  keep your eyes on the road  bud  and seem marginally larger than those of the previous year  Climate control knobs and buttons face directly rearward at the center of the dashboard  potentially a stretch for short armed drivers  Unless you spring for the pricey captain s chairs and floor mounted shifter  the column mounted shifter makes access to the ignition a bit awkward  Buttons for the optional cruise control are on the face of the steering wheel  always a plus in my book The white on black instrument panel is clear and easy to read  note that Lariat trims have a ritzier black on offwhite look  Besides the gauges  there s also a set of idiot lights for all the usual warnings  Lariat drivers will find one of those ultra cool  and occasionally distracting  information centers with readouts of time  distance  fuel economy  etc  tucked beneath the voltmeter and oil pressure gauge Did Ford do the job  Ummm  not really   it s pretty much the same layout and interface as the 2003  with a continuation of reach and access problems  especially for smaller drivers b Time for the Driving Experience  Ford must ve listened to me last time around   they ve dumped the underpowered V6 engine that was standard in the last model run  Rumors say it will return next year  but I ll bet it s no longer a wimpy 202 hp  Mind you  they haven t offered a  new  standard engine  just dropped the little one  Now standard is the 4 6L Triton SOHC V8 that was optional last year  which generates 231 hp and 293 lb ft of torque  Last year s 5 4L V8 has undergone a major workover  bulking up to 300 hp and 365 lb ft  Much of the work on this engine   introducing variable valve timing and three valves per cylinder   was intended to boost both power and torque low in the RPM range  Ford claims that the engine delivers over 290 lb ft of torque at 1000 RPM  just barely above an idle  Comparison of last year s model specs with this year s  though  shows that the 2004s are are about a five inches longer and 300 500 pounds heavier across the board  which tends to dampen my enthusiasm for any increases in power Manual transmissions went the way of the V6 engine  no word on whether they ll return  For 2004  Ford bought out a new 4 speed electronic overdrive automatic  the only tranny available  Errr  excuse me  Ford  but how come you haven t been able to come up with a 5 speed  I thought you were working on  innnovation But the proof is in the driving  and to tell the truth  it s bit tough to tell that anything s been updated in some arenas  Acceleration isn t particularly impressive  try comparing it to a similar sized SUV  like the  a href content 56201285252 Chevy Suburban a  although it s admittedly better than the sluggish V6  Handling is somewhat improved  though still decidedly truck like  Although Ford brags that they refined the rear suspension   mostly by mounting the rear shocks outboard of the leaf springs and stiffening the frame rails   the truck still has a jittery ride and lots of side to side motion when empty  Ride quality will most certainly increase when some payload is added  however  as is normal for pickups  Steering has been improved by introduction of a power rack and pinion system  In a departure from previous steering  the driver maintains a good  road feel  even through the power steering system  and that certainly helps  For a truck this size  minimum length 211  maximum 249  handling is relatively sprightly   but beware the huge turning radius when it s time for parking  Handling is better for this vehicle than others I ve driven in its class  although I m waiting to get my hands on a 2004 Tundra and have yet to drive the latest version of the Ram  I ll let you know  Still and all  the ride is certainly an improvement over the punishing  kidney bashing ride of even ten years ago  Looks like the influx of drugstore cowboys seeking that  cool  pickup truck look has had an upside after all  Sound wise  this F150 is about the same as last year s  minor engine noise and low to moderate wind and road noise Did Ford do the job  A qualified  maybe  they dumped the wimpy V6 and improved the suspension and steering   but I m unvconvinced that the improvement is enough to leapfrog the competition  I also miss manual trannies b Safety  All F 150s come with two dual stage front airbags  a passenger side deactivation switch is provided for Regular Cabs  Front seatbelts  which are integrated into the body of the seat  are equipped with pretensioners and an energy management system  all outboard seating positions have three point harnesses as does the rear center position in SuperCrews and SuperCabs LATCH points are standard All configurations have standard four wheel disc brakes with ABS  and side intrusion door beams Side airbags are not available even as an option  neither is a side curtain system  This is troubling  since Ford certainly knows how to install them in their other vehicles  including the Excursion and an optional canopy system offered in the a href content 77758566020 Expedition a  Go figure Did Ford do the job  No  Where are the side airbags  the traction control   Line at the Bottom  To sum up  Ford has indeed touched on every major system in the new F 150  frame  suspension  transmission  engine  they cheated a bit there  and interior and exterior design  Where they ve done best is in the cosmetics  especially the amount of attention lavished on the interior and in the across the board inclusion of four doors on the cab  They were smart to drop the V6  but  I think  dumb to drop the manual tranny  the updated automatic transmission may be an improvement but it s not particularly noticeable  A couple of points stand out in my overview of the model update  first  how come Ford can t seem to come up with a broader range of powertrain options  Only two engines and one transmission is about what they offer in their bottom of the line compacts  And second  why do they steadfastly refuse to even offer optional side airbags or a canopy system  we know thay have one from their SUVs  It s my feeling that Ford just didn t quite leap far enough forward with the update  Sure  they ve stayed ahead of or even with the GMC and Dodge offerings  but those footsteps with a Japanese accent are sounding just as loud as before  I m gonna say that the improvement wasn t enough to bring the F 150 up to five stars  I ll let you know for sure after I ve finished testing a new Tundra  but right now  I m not overly impressed by the model change  At the moment 2003s are selling at  5000 7000 discounts  and you ll get a darned good truck for that price  Hurry  though   cause the selections are dwindling  
Pos, Way before I got interested into writing about cars  the F series has been America s best selling truck  It s been like that for more than 25 years  In fact  many industry insiders will admit that the F series has saved Ford company when it hits hard times  It goes without saying that on our local freeways and highways  you will find an F 150 truck out of every 3 truck  I had never given much attention to the truck until I started spending more time on a friend s farm  It appears that all his father s trucks have been a F 150 over the years  What I have found to be the enduring values of this great vehicle are its practicality and strength  This year  the Ford 150 sounds quieter and more refined thanks to a 75 part noise  vibration and harshness upgrade  From what I can remember  the 2003 F 150 SuperCrew drives so much better than its predecessors  It appears that Ford can only continue to improve its well known crown jewels  This is a truck that has withstood times and economic hardships  It continues to deliver power and durability in the line of full size pickups  Based on the 2003 F series  I just can t wait to test drive the 2004 F series which has caused so much hoopla so far There are three trim series that are available on the SuperCab models XL  XLT and Lariat  It offers so much comfort and cargo carrying capacity that most buyers end up comparing it with its main competitors on the market  It makes sense that they end up purchasing this truck for the type of package and value   Taking a look at its interior  Some of the features that you will find on this truck include the following  standard power adjustable pedals  power moonroof and a functional bed extender in case you want to increase the box length for carrying longer items  This truck has come handy on the farm  Many construction workers purchase them too  It s great to carry cargo  Other features include  air conditioning  overhead console  power windows with delayed accessory power and one touch down driver s window  power locks  tilt steering wheel  speed control and power moonroof  Electronic automatic temperature control is standard on the truck To help secure your cargo  tie down hooks are located in each corner of all F 150 cargo boxes  In addition  you will find out that the cargo light on the back of the cab makes loading and unloading the truck box very easy at night  Ford designs this truck with the owner user in mind  To provide you with comfort  the designers place a rear step bumper that gives easy access to the cargo area  The tailgate can be removed for special loading duties b How about the truck s powertrain b F 150 SuperCab 4 2 liter OHV V 6 engine produces 202 horsepower and 252 foot pounds of torque  The split port induction system tends to optimize fuel efficiency and engine response  No wonder that I had a ball when test driving and working with this truck on the farm  Very few trucks are that responsive when you need them to  It comes with a four speed automatic overdrive transmission  That s an option that the owner wanted  With so many packages that are available out there on these trucks  you can have anything that you want as long as you can afford it  This is true in the case of the towing and payload ratings of the F 150 tester   With all those statistics  how did I feel driving the truck b i Ride  handling  safety and security issues  FYI  All F 150 trucks come equipped with a four wheel anti lock braking system  That s standard  The short and long arm independent fron suspension enhances my ride and handling  All in all  it was quite a smooth ride  I was amazed by its handling  For the driver and passenger  the truck is equipped with air bag supplemental restraint system  There is also the side door intrusion beams that help protect passengers or occupants in the case of a side door impact or accident  Countless lives may have been saved thanks to this upgrade  LATCH child safety seat tethers are standard equipment on the F 150 trucks  Also  belt minder system encourages safety belt use  This way  you won t have to drive long and short distances without putting on your belts  Remote keyless entry offers added convenience and security at night by activating the interior lights  How handy this features has come especially when you have to park away from the lighted parking lot  In the fields of California  we sometimes have to leave our trucks for very long periods of time b Final thoughts  The Ford 150 series can only get better  The company wants to innovate with the 2004 pickup too  If you have not gotten a Ford  you can wait for the 2004 truck  I don t necessarily trust other Ford vehicles  but after working with the F series  I would invite anybody to give it a try   Why should you buy the  a href content 104412515972 2004 Toyota Sienna a  Find out more  
Pos, Ok so maybe Econoline Vans aren t for everyone  especially if you live in the city  If you aren t someone that lives in the city and you like to drive long distances on vacations then this vehicle is for you What s The Interior Of The Econoline Like Well one way to explain this question is by comparing the interior of an econoline to that of an airplane that is first class  The seats are very comfortable  and my particular model is equipped with gadgets galore  A plug in vacuum  a TV and VCP  a mechanical bed that turns into a back seat  a 10 disc CD Changer  and much more  With power AC a ride to my grandparents house in Florida is very comfortable What s The Mile Per Gallon On The Econoline Although I am very seldom a driver of my econoline since my parents do most of the driving I do know that the Econoline gets better miles to the gallon then that of a Jeep Grand Cherokee  Note  This may not be accurate for all types of Cherokees  The only reason I say this fact is because I recall my mother and my uncle comparing gas mileage prices  And the econoline was better then the jeep How Is The Handling Of An Econoline Although I very seldom use the econoline for my personal driving the few times I ve used it I noticed that it is a difficult vehicle to manuever in tight situations  This is due to the size of the vehicle rather then the steering  The steering is very good  the only difficulty with the handling is getting used to the size of the vehicle Why Should Someone Buy One These Like I said earlier the Econoline is not for everyone  If you are however one who likes the travel  then this is the perfect car for your needs  With good miles to the gallon  and an extremely good ride  it is well worth the money br br  
Pos, Last year  we decided to trade our family car for a sports car  We already had a Chevy Lumina  so we decided it was time to get rid of the unreliable Grand Am and go to a sporty car  We shopped around before deciding on what car to purchase  We test drove a Mitsubishi Eclipse  Chevy Monte Carlo  Mazda RX 7  Ford Probe and Eagle Talon  All the ones that we test drove were around the same year and handled relatively the same We went out of town to a car dealer to look and test drive more models  At the third dealer we came to  we told the sales person what we were looking for and the price range and he immediately directed us to a lonely  Ford Mustang  just waiting to be brought home by some lucky person  Without delay  we test drove this car  This Mustang is a 1997 LX V6 Automatic with power windows  power door locks  CD stereo system  dual air bags and power driver s seat  While looking this car over  we discovered that it only had 15 000 original miles on the odometer  We checked everything on the car  inside and out  and we decided to purchase  We got it for a steal at  12 500 After having the car for almost a year  I still love it as much as the day we bought it  Well  that is a little exaggerated because we have had a few small problems  but overall it is still great The engine in my  Ford Mustang  is a little short on power  but it will do for me  It does get good gas mileage  if I keep my foot out of it  In curves  I really do not like the way it handles  I had a Saturn 2 door coupe that would whip it in curves as far as handling goes  But this car cruises the highway very comfortably The fit and finish on my Mustang is great  Everything lines up and looks good  However  the dash and all the plastic molding on the inside do rattle and squeak but I will deal with this little annoyance because I love the car so much  The mounting pads in the strut tower tend to squeak really bad on bumps  Obviously all  Ford Mustangs  are like this because my husband had an  87 model that done the same thing  We have done routine maintenance on the car and that has kept this Stang in great working order  My hubby loves this car because it is one of the few that is still rear wheel drive  He likes the fact that the engine is sitting in the car the way it should be  In other words  he can work on the car easily The only major problem that we have experienced with the car is the check engine light coming on  The flap in the gas tank sticking open and not building up enough fuel pressure caused this  Once we took it to a dealer and had the problem corrected  we have not had any more problems But I will admit  it is not great for when kids are involved  A rear facing car seat will not fit into the small back seat  I now use a front facing car seat and do not have any problems  Even though we have experienced a few minor problems  I would still highly recommend the  Ford Mustang  to anyone wanting a good cruising car  The car is not only reliable  but is very sexy  It has a muscular stance and does not look like a catfish coming down the road like the Chevy Camaro  I am not knocking the Camaro because it is a great car too  but mine just looks better  LOL   
Pos, If you are looking for a new car  for sure go with the Ford Mustang  I ve had my 97  cherry red ford mustang for a little over 31 2 years now and it s the best car i have ever owned  It gets great gas mileage  high speed  and of course it looks awesome  Only thing is  this is NOT a family car  The front seats give you plenty of leg room and you can be very comfortable  But  i must say the back seat area must of been designed for kids only  it s rather small and crampy  If you have young children who still use car seats this  is most likely not the car for you  I ve tried numerous times to fit a carseat in the backseat and still have the passenger in my car comfortable with enough room  needless to say it never worked out  What I love about this car  is that i have had basically NO problems with it whatsoever  Never had to take it to the shop  new tires put on  nothing  It s a very HIGH quality car  The car drives like a DREAM  I highly suggest it for anyone  Insurance can be a real pain in the rear end though  owning a mustang means outrageous insurance people  But  it s well worth every penny of it br br  
Pos, I bought my Mustang GT 1 year ago  It was a low mile  V8  convertible  I absolutely love it  A very fun car  The styling is great   better than the  99 s and 2K s  and much nicer than the earlier boxy style  The fit and finish is fine  It did have some acid rain damage from the previous owner  A trip to the body shop and  300 later solved 95  of the problem  The car is black  and I am very fussy  It s a bit noisy with the top up while on the highway  but heck  it s a convertible  The leather seats are very comfortable  I love getting into it  The 4 6L engine and 5 speed transmission are super  Plenty of power  Nice sounding stock  dual exhaust  I use the car mostly on weekends   as a fun car  It will be stored for the winter  This car will never see snow  ice and salt  A friend has a BMW 3 series convertible  Sorry  dollar for dollar  no comparison to my pony  The BMW is a high tech  high priced  sterile car  The Mustang is an all American muscle car  I could see buying a 6 cylinder coupe as a family or second car  although rear wheel traction would be a problem in winter     
Pos, As my 16th birthday rolled around  the dream of owning a hot set of wheels became more prominent in my blonde little head  I knew nothing about cars  engines  etc  but I did know that I loved the color purple  This 1997 V6 Mustang that sat at a local dealer was very much purple  and is now very much mine  My boyfriend  who is a die hard Chevy man  warned me about the car  but now has grown to love it almost as much as me As far as power goes  the V6 is all I will ever need  although it may be a little sluggish for some power hungry people  I adore the color  a bright vibrant purple that I can only find in  97 Stangs  and I think the light grey interior is tasteful  The power locks  windows  and seats are a luxury that I have grown to appreciate  The front seats are very comfortable and with being only 4 11  tall  the power up button on the seats makes driving very comfortable  However  as for any sports car the backseat is perfect for holding my backpack  shopping bags  and purse but not my friends  The gas cap can be slightly awkward as I recall being at a filling station 30 minutes away from home  the needle on  E  bawling to my boyfriend on my cell phone that I couldn t figure it out  Once I got the hang of it  there hasn t been any problems since  Speaking of gas  it gets around 25 mpg when I drive it in town and about 18 mpg when my bf drives it   Although  I ve been told that Mustangs are  a dime a dozen  I take pride in the fact that I drive a new model of an original classic car  I also take pride in the stares I receive when I drive down the road  I also like the fact that aftermarket parts are so easy to find  so fixing one up is a breeze All in all  I suggest this car for anyone who doesn t have children  usually drives alone  and wants a good looking car  
Pos, I am originally from NYC  No one there drive as pickup primary car  The Explorer Sport Trac breaks all the rule and whenever  I drive my ride home people stop and ask me so many questions about this good looking ride  Never in a million years did I think I would ever be caught in a pickup  Not only that you think parrallel parking would be difficult  especially in NYC  I have put this baby in some spaces  Ford went way out on this ride by combining the comfort of the SUV EXPLORER and F150 Truck to come up with a ride both woman and men could take pleasure  The Sport Trac definitely makes a statement about ones personality and a taste This four door pickup truck easily accommodates four 6 ft men  Fully powered Even the automatic rear window is great feature  The sound system alone blows most cars off the road  Equipped with not only standard speakers  This ride roars with bottom  BASS  Just like a night club  with all the windows rolled up and volume at set at half sounds heard outside the car are crystal clear Long distance driving is a breeze  Comfortable and great on gas  Switch 2 to 4 wheel drive  high or low in a breeze  Air conditioning is great  I spent tow in in Charleston  SC and it get hot down there  The best part is the bed  This sure comes in handy  Of course it is larger than a car trunk put smaller than a standard size bed  However  you can fit most anything in there I purchased this vehicle last October 2001 for my birthday and what I love most is this is simply a great looking all around multi purpose truck that I am proud to take anywhere whether it to the supermarket or waiting valet attendant  This SUV MPV Pick up truck turns heads and burns rubber when I have to  
Pos, With all the hype about the 2000 Ford Focus  you d think that Ford was giving away rocketships  Is the 2000 Ford Focus a well equipped  comfortable economy car  Absolutely  Is it the dawning of a new era of Euro styled  ergonomically attuned  New Edge globally conceived econovehicles  or whatever the marketing gobbledegook says  Uh  I dunno  That part is a little over my head  but it sounds overstated  It s just a car  but it s a good car b Mission Affordable b I wanted to purchase a new car for my sister for her birthday  I m no millionaire  and her needs are simple  She doesn t drag race  Nor does she haul a horse trailer  transport Scout troops  or need to make a socioeconomic statement with her vehicle  She just needs to commute to work and get to wherever else she needs to go  It would be nice if her butt didn t go numb and if she didn t explode into flames in the process  In the past  my family has had a host of American label economy cars  and I admit that that s what I m partial to  I looked at a number of comparable cars  Chevrolet Cavalier  Dodge Plymouth Neon  Saturn S series  Ford Escort  etc  I had never even heard of a Ford Focus until I began researching new cars  and I certainly hadn t seen one  But in the end  that s what I ended up with  My sister is happy  I m happy  I d do it again  I d recommend this car to others b Bang for the Buck b So  what does  16 000 get you these days  The standard 2000 Ford Focus SE sedan costs  13 660 MSRP  12 716 invoice  One can visit Ford s official website  www fordvehicles com  for all the specifics  but this includes such standard features as  dual air bags  air conditioning  am fm radio with cassette  power locks and mirrors  remote keyless entry   quot securilock quot  passive anti theft system  panic alarm  24 hour roadside assistance  15 quot  wheels  60 40 split fold rear seat  manual seat height adjuster  vanity mirrors on both visors  interior trunk release latches  3 year 36 000 mile bumper to bumper warranty The options I selected are as follows upgraded  quot Zetec quot  engine    200 MSRP  178 invoice automatic transmission    815 MSRP  725 invoice comfort group  arm rest with storage  tilt telescoping steering wheel  cruise control  map lights    395 MSRP  352 invoice front and rear floor mats    55 MSRP  50 invoice power windows    295 MSRP  263 invoice anti lock brakes    400 MSRP  356 invoice The destination fee is  465  and the manufacturer determined advertising fee is  130  These two fees are supposed to be non negotiable  Adding all this up gives a figure ranging from  16 415  MSRP figures  to  15 235  invoice figures  This makes the 2000 Ford Focus SE sedan an affordable car  but not the least expensive car that one could possibly purchase  I will echo what everyone else has said  For the money  this car offers a lot of features and feels like a more expensive vehicle  Also very relevant to me  since I wanted to finance this car  is Ford Credit s attractive financing rate  In my area  the best credit union offered a 7  APR on 4 year auto loans  Currently  Ford offers 5 9  for the same loan  4 9  for 3 year loans  and 6 9  for 5 year loans  This is another area where one can save a few dollars with this vehicle b Form Embodies Function b Either you think that the 2000 Ford Focus is attractive  or you don t  There s not much middle ground  The SE sedan looks very similar to a Volkswagon Jetta with ugly and unmistakable triangular headlights  It took me a while to learn to accept the headlights  I admit  The car is tall and blunt not unlike a Toyota Echo with a hood that arcs sharply downward and a rump that seems a bit elevated  It s not to everyone s taste  to be sure  Several professional writers have called the sedan  quot boring quot  but I think that it is an appealing car  I think that the Focus hatchback is an eyesore  however  To each his own  Frankly  I don t select a car based strictly on aesthetics The shape of the car is functional  to be sure  Because it is tall for its size  it gives the illusion of being a larger car  Seats are set high enough that one doesn t feel like their  quot knees are bumping the handlebars quot  when seated  It has accurately been described as chairlike or mini van SUV like inside  Legs hang comfortably  and one views the road from a taller vantage  You don t feel vulnerable in this car like you might in some other small car  It is easy to get in and out of  because the seats are rump level  I found that the back seat is especially comfortable in this regard  Similarly  the elevated height makes it easy to access the trunk without a lot of bending and stretching   What I like about this car b Roominess  As discussed above  the car feels a lot bigger than it is  In addition to head and leg room  the trunk is cavernous  Both back seats can be folded to offer even more cargo area  I expect a small car to feel small  so the roomy feel to this small car is a really nice surprise  Comfort  No question about it  this is a very comfortable car for its class  The fabric seats are well cushioned and supportive  The suspension absorbs irregularities in the road very effectively  My neighborhood is rotten with potholes and road construction at the moment  and yet I barely feel any lumps and bumps in this car  Even though it s a small car  I could travel a distance in it with ease  The back is sufficiently spacious for two passengers  especially kids Adjustable driver s seat  Related to the above is the driver s seat itself  It is adjustable in three different ways  The back of the seat can recline as much as you need it to  The seat can be pulled closer to or further away from the steering wheel  And the seat can be raised and lowered  I love the latter feature  Some writers have complained about the simple crank mechanism that raises or lowers the seat  but I consider it refreshing to have a non electronic means to adjust the seat  The fact that I can do it at all is wonderful  but the fact that it didn t cost me a small fortune as an option is even better  This is particularly important because my sister and I differ in height by six or seven inches Adjustable steering wheel  If adjusting the seat isn t enough  the steering wheel can be adjusted up down or in out with the tilt telescoping properties  Whether someone is short or tall  small or large  I believe that they d be able to make the necessary adjustments to be totally comfortable in this car Handling  This car is really a pleasure to drive  The small diameter steering wheel has comfortable swollen grips on it  and the steering is accurate and easy  Braking is similarly responsive  In spite of some of the literature that suggests that the car is underpowered  my experience is that it is very zippy  Put simply  it starts  stops  and turns very comfortably and easily  It feels very secure on the road  never light or tippy or weak  not bad for a car that only weighs 2 600 pounds  I can only imagine that anyone displeased with the handling is comparing it to something out of its class  perhaps a larger luxury car or racy sportscar  Peace and quiet  The Focus is smooth handling and surprisingly quiet in certain respects  Turn signals quietly tock tock tock  The hydraulically opening trunk is shockingly quiet  as are the doors   By contrast  I jump a foot in the air when the doors automatically lock as I drive away  That s loud  Again  in spite of reports to the contrary  I have not found that the engine is excessively noisy  You hear it rev when you accelerate  but it s never loud enough to interfere with conversation  My friend s Saturn has a much louder engine Silly little things  The storage slots on the inside of the front doors for holding maps and such are really wide  You can easily fit a novel instead of just a magazine in these slots  One of the things I like best about that is that it makes them easy to vacuum clean The radio faceplate can be removed easily so that the radio is rendered functionless if it s stolen  I don t know who would steal the factory radio out of an economy car  nor do I know who would worry about it getting stolen  but hey  it s one of those fun things to show your friends  Worth noting  the radio allows you to preset 6 am and 12 fm stations  If you have a lot of favorite radio stations  that s a nice feature  There s a pen holder next to the driver s seat  The glove box is huge  You could fit a Taco Bell dog in there  along with your owner s manual  The ASPCA advises against this  however The owner s manual comes in a nice little zippered storage case that looks sophisticated  There are special hooks in the back seat to attach car seats for little ones  I don t have kids  but if I did  that would be a big plus  There are two great big cupholders in front with removable liners that can be easily cleaned b Gripes b Visibility  This is the biggest drawback to the Focus  With a hood that arcs sharply downward  it is virtually impossible to see the front of the car  You get a feel for where it is  but I d hate to have to parallel park this thing  It s not a car for tailgaters or big city parking for that reason  Similarly  the car s rump is elevated  so it s difficult to see where you re going when you back up  The big  obtrusive  front headrests and car frame itself further impede visibility rearward  The side mirrors compensate for this  however Illogical controls  Most of the controls are clearly labelled  and for the most part I have no complaint  But some of it seems senseless to me  The hazard light switch is the single most prominent feature on the dashboard  It s a huge orange triangle that begs to be pushed  I m in my thirties  and I ve never had the need to turn on the hazard lights in any car I ve driven  Even when the switch is less obvious  I ve always known where it was  but I ve never needed to use it  Why on Earth is it so prominent in this vehicle  What is Ford trying to tell me  By contrast  the am fm switch on the radio is microscopic and situated way to the right side of the radio  I ve learned where it is  but I still have to take my eyes off of the road to find it  Am I the only person who finds this irritating Windshield wiper controls  The turn signal control is on the left side of the steering wheel  In most cars I ve driven  the windshield wipers are located on the same stalk  Not in this car  The windshield wiper control is a separate stalk on the right side of the steering wheel  Why  This particular departure from convention annoys me Fuel gauge  It annoys me that I can t read the fuel level without turning the car on  Similarly  the odometer is an led panel that doesn t appear unless the car is on  I m not sure what the point of this is  other than to look fancy  But I suspect that with age  if either of these things got quirky  it would be expensive to fix them  Rear floor mats  Um  these things look like furry business envelopes  They re tiny  I believe that floor mats have become standard on the 2001 Focus  I certainly wouldn t pay extra for the rear ones Marketing  I have simple tastes  so I find a lot of the marketing for this car to be incredibly annoying  The brochure for this car is ugly and contains almost no information  Although the target market is young  20ish 30ish  women  the sales pitch is gimmicky and yuppified in tone with lots of irritating buzzwords bandied about  Anybody who uses the term ergonomic should be run over with a Hummer  Ironically  all the hype stresses how  quot European quot  this car is  I ve always owned American cars  I like American cars  Don t tell me that my Michigan built Ford is European  dammit  It s a turn off   The unknown b Reliability  Nobody knows  plain and simple  I purchase a car with the intention of putting 150 000  miles on it and keeping it for ten years or more  I hope this car carries me there  In any case  I ll update this as needed to reflect my gripes and concerns b Warnings b If you order your Ford Focus  be aware that they take forever to arrive  I was promised mine in 6 10 weeks  and it showed up 14 weeks later  Judging by what other people say  the average wait is about 12 weeks  Also  keep in mind that some people have had problems with these cars  Take a look at the  quot town hall quot  at Edmunds  www edmunds com  and or the message board at Club Focus  www discussion board com clubfocus  to see what others have had to say   Bottom line b Be clear about what you want in a car  If you want an economy car that is comfortable and well equipped  at least consider a 2000 Ford Focus  Do your homework at Edmunds  www edmunds com  and other online sites  Take a look  Go for a test drive  My sister used to be a firm Ford hater  but she loves this car  If I had it to do over  I d buy it again  Hopefully it will stand the test of time     
Pos,  What a pleasant surprise to have Ford build an affordable  cool  well sorted domestic pocket rocket and then to have so many bolt on performance parts available after only a year b To start out with the ZX3 has a racing history in the FIA World Rally Championship  WRC  Drivers Colin McRae and Carlos Sainz are trying to capture the manufacturers title this year  Anyway  your ZX3 likely did not get the Rally Option with the 230 hp motor  but you ll be pleased to learn that you can come real close to that with some carefully chosen bolt on goodies   disclaimer  these upgrades may invalidate your warranty   do your homework before modifying your new car b    Start with a K amp N air filter if you want to keep a stealth stock look  or you could opt for one of the umpteen gazillion cold air induction kits    Next you ll want an aftermarket exhaust to let everything breate a little easier  The one from http www focussport com has a great exhaust note and is relatively easy to put on  you will have to cut the stock exhaust off  however    Next go for an underdrive pulley which will free up a few horsepower   A performance chip is always an easy way to increase power   sometimes by as much as 20 hp    If you re really serious about more horsepower there are actually turbo kits available as well    Think about some nice cosmetic goodies also   a duck tail rally car style wing   check out  http www focaljet com  for group buys  There are also tons of ground effects kits from West Wings and others    Lower the car to improve the handling and appearance   try the coil overs if you can afford it  but just a solid set of lowering springs should do fine for all but the most serious competitior  try H amp Rs    WHEELS    some people use the  Contour SVT 16 quot  wheels  my personal favorite b  while others have used the Cougar 16 quot  wheels  both of these fit great since the bolt pattern is shared  There are also a ton of 17 quot  wheels that are fairly cheap that look great like the Konig Monsoon The sky is the limit from there  Check out the websites mentioned above for great tech articles also  What a great car and some great ways to improve it even more br br  
Pos, I decided to put some fun in my commute   120 miles a day roundtrip  when I decided to buy a new car  Enter the Ford Focus ZX3 b MY FIRST NEW CAR   MAIN REASONS TO BUY  I bought it because it s great handling  decent fuel economy  price and over all fun ness to drive  I know  fun ness  is very subjective but trust me   take a ZX3 for a test drive you ll see  It was my first NEW car ever and I didn t want to throw my money away  I researched very carefully  I looked at the obvious in it s class ish Honda  reliable but dull  Toyota Echo  see my other review  way too many cons  VW  too much money for not enough car  and some others  I went to each dealer armed with TONS of information off the internet with stats and INVOICE pricing on each car  I knew exactly what each car cost the dealer at its INVOICE price  So  I knew what I could get for how much without paying too much over sticker  I wound up paying exactly the invoice price for my new silver ZX3 5 spd with AC and tilt wheel with navigator options b  THE DRIVE  To tell you the truth  the 5 spd is REALLY zippy  It won t beat a Corvette or anything on a jack rabbit stop light start  but it really cruises along best at highway speeds  I often look down at the speedometer to unknowingly be going 80  The ZX3 is very easy to negotiate through all kinds of traffic  with good stopping power  And the cornering is awesome for a little Ford  Take it on a test drive  hopefully without the sales person  JUST so you can take those corners FAST   you ll see Added bonus  PARKING  If you live in a city where parking is at a premium  you can squeeze into those tiny spots while the envious Monster SUV owners have no choice but to cruise on by  N  Side of Chicago especially b INTERIOR  The interior is great   easy to get to everything and doesn t look feel cheap for the inexpensive amount you paid   the leather wrapped steering wheel is a nice touch  The back seat is VERY roomy  Every time someone gets back there they always say something about how much room there is  AND most of these people drive full sized cars and are used to room b ADDED BONUS  Leather wrapped steering wheel Fog Lights CD Player Are ALL standard b  THE NOT SO GREAT   Now this is not to say the car hasn t had problems  It has  The brake pads and rotors were replaced at 4 000 miles  I am at 13 000 no probs since  and of course the re have been recalls  Mine was only affected by one recall  These are actually things I can deal with  but considering my service dept where I bought the car sucks  it makes it even more difficult to deal with these problems  I expected to have some probs  DID NOT expect the service to suck as much as it does  So  before you buy make sure you find out how good the  service  IS in the service department    Overall  Some problems are to be expected if you want to be the first kid on the block with the cool new toy such is the case with the 2000 Ford Focus ZX3 The really good news is  a lot of the bugs have since been worked out with the 2001s Just because you have to buy economy doesn t mean you have to feel like you re driving an econo box  see the Toyota Echo b Ford Focus ZX3   you get a lot of car  for not a lot of money    Note  Why revised  Because I wrote this before I knew at Epinions  I simply wrote it at first  to tell everyone in the market what a great car this was  I didn t even know what Epinions was  The revisions have cleared up some of the format to be more Epinion friendly  Thanks  revised June 2001 Update  32 000 miles in one year so far so good  Warrenty will be up soon  No problems with brakes since 13K  but still worried about them Still handles well  although gas milage seems to be dipping  I used to get about 32MPG  mostly highway  now I average about 27 MPG  
Pos, My sister purchased a new Ford Focus Hatchback ZX3 and I have had the chance to drive it around a ton  The weird part about it is I can t stop driving this little car  i love it  Now I know that is weird to say about a Ford  especially their affordable compact  but it s true  Ford has put together one of  if not the best  small cars on the market  The idea behind the Focus is to make a safe  reliable  and fun car that can be had in three body styles  hatchback  sedan  and wagon  I was personally expecting Ford to build a mediocre compact similar to the escort  but they certainly outdid themselves with this car The exterior of the Focus has yet to grow on me  It seems tall  oddly shaped and misproportioned  I am starting to get used to the  quot new edge quot  styling that Ford is employing  but I am not convinced that it makes a good looking or striking car  if anything it makes the car less striking and more boring  If this car had clean  sleek lines I think Ford would have had an even bigger winner than they have  Overall  for the money  the exterior is solidly built and in it s own way sporty  The one thing about the car that sets it apart though is its shape  especially the hatchback  people always seem confused on what they think about the car when they see it  The exterior of the car is not where the beauty is  as a matter of fact the interior isn t much better  the beauty of the car starts behind the wheel  This car is more fun than anyone could imagine from looking at it  The steering is crisp  gives good feedback  and can SERIOUSLY corner  You would think a car so tall would be washy on the road  but this thing can be tossed around  I was so surprised that at first I didn t believe it  I thought it was more of an illusion than reality  so I looked up the Focus  statistics in Car and Driver and I wasn t wrong  The car puts up slalom and skidpad numbers that rival cars such as the Camaro and Firebird  Now that is impressive for a compact that rounds out at  15000  I felt very sure of the car s footing and felt as if I had total control of the car at all times  Body roll was a little excessive  but still much better than 90  of American made cars  Back to the interior  there s really not a lot to say  Obviously  since it is a cheap car it is very basic  The ergonomics of the instruments are good  everything is in the right place and is easy to use  You also may notice the included air bags at no extra cost  a very responsible move by Ford that I appreciate  The great part about the interior is the build quality  it is much better than the escorts poorly built interior  As a matter of fact  with a little refinement  the Focus  build quality will be comparable to Honda and other Japanese companies Now that I have ranted and raved about this car  are there any downsides you ask  Yes  the engine  That is not to say it isn t sufficient  it just doesn t match the ability of the suspension system  The Zetec 4 cylinder is zippy  but does not have the punch you need for merging into highway traffic  If they could fit the 6 cylinder from the contour in this car it would be an absolute blast  The other downside is the suspension can be a little stiff at times  more than it could or should be  Some may also say the styling is a major problem  but I think if you get behind the wheel  the styling will be forgiven  My sister has not had the car long enough to see if it will be reliable or not  but it seems that it will be  Those are the only gripes  and for a car this price  that is amazing  Ford has put together exactly what they wanted to create  and they definitely did not forget the fun  This car could also catch on with the tuner crowd also  and if I was gonna build a boy racer  this would probably be the car I started with  it has the goods to be amazing  This is one GREAT car br br  
Pos, At the age of 40  I found myself in the market for a commuter car when we decided to give our old one to a relative  As it had been some time until I had looked at an  entry level  car  it was with some trepidation that I approached a dealer lot to look at the Ford Focus  The last  entry  Ford I had owned was an  82 Mercury Bobcat straight out of college  and quality was not a word you would associate with that car Even though Ford markets this car to a much younger audience  I found that it had a number of features that appealed to me  the styling  a bit annoying at first  grew on me  My wife and niece think the car is  cute  for just over  14 000 paid for my hatchback model ZX3  the car is well equipped with 2 0L  quot Zetec quot  engine  130 hp  power windows doors  A C  automatic transmission  more on that later  cruise control  front and rear mats  remote entry system and alarm  tilt telescoping steering wheel  and a surprisingly adequate CD radio combination  I like to listen to LOUD classical music   with plenty of low brass  The radio even can adjust its sound level automatically to deal with ambient noise  About the only option I would have like to have added was the side impact air bags  which are available   a rarity in a car of this class  I m 6 6 quot  and have a pretty wide body  but the seats are quite supportive and the head room excellent  The telescoping steering wheel was a big plus  since I did have to tilt the driver side seat back  Then again  I ve had to do that in much larger cars  handling is fairly crisp  especially for an American small car  but overall ride quality is quite decent  as is road noise  Fit and finish is excellent  comparable to small Japanese cars Ford has hit the nail on the head with this award winning  world car  or at least come closer than they have before to producing a small car that can take on the Hondas and Toyota small models  The only inconveniences are small ones  For a 130 hp  130 ft lb torque engine  the automatic transmission ratios do not seem terribly well implemented  I had test driven a coupe model with the standard 5 speed which seemed much more responsive  I find a lot of downshifting required to accelerate promptly  on the highway  a convenient  quot overdrive off quot  button on the shifter makes this somewhat easier  ZX3 s don t seem to come with center consoles  which leaves your right arm sort of hanging  Front passenger seats  although equipped with a handle to tilt out of the rear passengers  way  do not automatically slide out of the way as do many other small cars  seats  CD player cannot fast forward through tracks  a minor but odd omission All in all  if you re looking for a small  fun  inexpensive  well built  and cute car  you d do worse than to test drive the Ford Focus  Also available  but not reviewed  are several models of sedan with differing trim levels  SE  LX  ZTS  a station wagon SE  and a couple of  quot custom quot  models including the Sony and  I think  one featuring a Trek bicycle and rack  with a unique color called  quot Dirt quot     
Pos, I bought my Ford Focus 2000 SE Sony Edition as a new leftover about a month ago  and I am extremely pleased with it  I bought it to replace my Ford Escort SE  which was a decent car  but nowhere near as fun as the Focus  I have also previously owned a 1990 Subaru Loyale  which felt like an old lady car  and a 1993 Mitsubishi Eclipse  which was not a very good car  but there was some fun to it  and I like the Focus by far the best First  handling and driving  I have seen a few opinions that say that this car is not quite as peppy as the writers  expectations  I disagree  I have a bit of a lead foot  and I find that the car does quite well at higher speeds  I live in Philadelphia  and travel on Interstate 95 daily  and you have to be able to drive between 75 and 80 mph to keep up  It doesn t take the car long to get to those speeds  mine is a 5 speed manual Z Tec engine  and the car performs very well with no shimmying or shaking  The ride is extremely smooth for a small car  and pot holes and bumps are barely noticeable  which in Philadelphia is almost an impossibility  Second  features  Granted  my model is a much more  packed  model than most of the other Focuses  or is it Foci  due to the fact that it is a special edition  but I don t feel that I paid an exorbitant amount for the features I got  My model has all leather seats  all electric  windows  mirrors  etc  sport package  spoiler and wheels  and of course the Sony XPlode stereo   speaker package  All of these amenities are easily accessible to the driver without much reaching  due not only to the fact that it is a small car and the instrument panel is not far from you  but also to the fact that the interior engineering is  in a word  terrific  I am not sure how the features compare on the base model  but I would say that if you are going to buy this car  go for the features  because for the small expense  you will find that they really are worth it Third  design  This car is designed very well  It is slightly wider and longer than the Escort  it would probably be more appropriate to compare it to the Contour  but I don t have much experience with that particular car  but the car is MUCH higher  The additional height makes for a much more comfortable ride for taller drivers  I m 6 2  because your legs don t get all cramped up underneath the dash  It also provides additional head room  of which I am not accustomed  There is at least a good 3  between the top of my head and the ceiling  and for me that is a definite plus  The seats are adjustable up and down  so I m certain that shorter drivers will get as much enjoyment out of this car as taller  And lets face it  the car actually looks pretty good  I have read the biographies on the engineering of this car  and it was mostly designed in Europe  The sleeker design and headlight placement give this car a little more personality than its predecessors the Escort and Contour  Passengers that have ridden in the back seat have commented that it is surprisingly comfortable for a small car  and the rear leg room was much more than expected Forth  it s a Ford  For a while  Ford was a bit of a punchline  FORD   Fix Or Repair Daily  or Found On Road Dead  but in the last 5 or so years  they have really changed things around  The redesign of the Escort  Tempo  which essentially became the Contour  and Taurus in the 1997 model year went very well  my Escort required NO major repairs   I never even had to get tires on it after 4 years and 70 000  miles  and from what I m reading  the Focus takes even further steps in being a maintenance free car In short  I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a smaller  but really not too small  that is fun to drive  
Pos, Ford has done it again  They have crammed a ton of engineering in a sport value package  I was extremely impressed by this car  From the outside it looks like a new edge design  nothing too special there  once you get in you know its something different  The interior is wonderfully laid out  The stereo is near perfect  the right touch  button size and distance from both passengers  The materials scream quality for  15000 like no other ford i ve been in  The interior material also has style  something I cant say for most value oriented cars  The seats are comfortable  the room  amazing  Im 6 1  250 and I could easy sit in any of the seats  the middle rear is a stretch  The steering wheel and shifter feel like they have been stolen off an a european sports sedan  The Zetec four  Ford should come clean  they must have stolen that off a japanese car  smooth  nice sound  good power  no way an American 4 cylinder  The suspension  wow  its fun to drive too  imagine that  Ford has really done it with this car  This segment is full of buzzing econoboxes  but this car stands apart  Numbers on its datasheet cant tell you about this car  You need to drive it to understand  Yea there are cars that can do all of these things better but not at this price  That is the key  For this amount of money its a true value  Ford put a lot of thought into the car  Safety  reliability  simplicity  performance  looks and VALUE  Great package Perfomance  For this segment its great  Acceleration  handing and steering are all top of the pack  The engine could be a bit more powerful but I will wait for a SVT version for that  A larger wheel tire package would be nice too Comfort  The seats are good  They arent volvo seats but for this size car they are comfortable for long trips and around town  They could use some more bolstering for spirited driving  Styling  Thats a personal opinion  I find the car attractive  not an attention getter but not too cute like the Beetle  The front end is nice but the rest of the car seems a little bland  Again this is not a very expensive car so I cant complain Safety  Almost All ford products  lets not get into tires here  have high crash ratings  The Focus  package is well put together and solid  Airbag equipment is present  Its brakes are good  Traction control option would be nice  added cost though     
Pos, I am currently driving a Ford Focus  My van is in the shop and I got this car as a rental  I was exited to get it as I was just checking them out on the lot at the dealership  My husband in the next year or two will be needing a new car and this in in our price range The first thing I noticed after getting in the car was the roominess My husband is 6 quot  tall and has no problem fitting in it  It feels like you are not in fact in a compact car  But after driving it for the last few days I have been noticing little things that I don t like about it  One is the fact that there is no arm rest between the front seats  For me it was uncomfortable to have no place to put my arm  Also I had a hard time adjusting the seat back  The handle for it is in an awkward position and I had to open the door to gain access to it  Also I understand that the Focus is a compact but it seems to work really hard to get to highway speeds  This might be due to engine size but I don t know what size it has One last thing I did not like is the shifter  The car I have is an automatic and you can easily knock the shifter into another gear without pushing in the button A plus of the Focus is that it comes with tether anchors for car seats  Three of them  I don t know that three car seats could actually fit back there but two definitely could  The car sits a little higher up than other compacts that I have been in  You don t feel like someone could drive right over you  All in all I thought it was a good basic car  Great for a first car or a second family car  It seems to get great gas mileage  I myself prefer my van but hey  if someone gave me this car I wouldn t turn it down     
Pos, I bought my Focus hatchback in late November  1999  and I now have almost 10 000 miles on it  It s the only new car I ve ever bought that didn t have any  bugs  Everything is perfect  I handles so well  it rides nicely  gets decent gas mileage  and is very nimble   easy to park  I bought it because it was unusual looking  to tell the truth  The Honda Civic was my other choice  but that car hasn t changed much in the last 10 years especially the interior  I just wanted something that not many people had  and even a year later  I don t see many hatchbacks mostly sedans are running around in L A There are a few things that I would change  the side view mirrors stick out too far I ve almost caught them on the garage wall several times  I still haven t been able to spot the oil filter in the engine compartment so I take it to the dealer for oil changes  I liked the seat s back support a little better in the Civic Consumer Reports recently rated it as the best small car they ve tested even better than the Jetta  If  they  liked it  you know it s a good car  I think their one complaint was that the doors didn t automatically unlock when you turn off the car  Well  I would like to be the one who decides when to unlock the doors  What if you re in an iffy neighborhood  To wrap up you can t go wrong with this car  A note  the hatchback is built at Ford s factory in Hermosillo  Mexico  This plant has the highest quality output of all the Ford factories in North America  I can attest to the quality  as my car has no squeaks or rattles  The sedan and wagon are built in Wayne  Michigan  From what I ve heard  their quality is good too  but the Mexico factory has a better reputation I got the car for  125 over invoice   no doc fee at Crystal Ford in Silver Spring Maryland  Update  11 2002 Car now has 23 000 miles   still not a single problem  Really glad I bought this car  I read Consumer Reports   they say that the Focus isn t that reliable  but I think they must be talking about the sedan   wagon  I have no regrets   I think the hatchback would be a great used car for anyone  
Pos, I recently purchased the 2000 Ford Focus  I am very impressed with the 16 valve 2 0 litre engine  The engine provides lots of power  There is plenty of room in the front and rear seats  My baby car seat fits comfortably in the rear seat  The console is attractively designed and has an original look  The LED display on the radio gives the time and station simultaneously  The manufacturer s CD and stereo system operate smoothly and provide decent sound  The car gets excellent gas mileage and performs well on the highway  It is convenient being able to access the trunk from the interior of the car  The windows and mirrors provide good 360 degree visibility  For first time car buyers  this is THE one  The price is reasonable for what you get  The car is inexpensive but has a luxury feel br br  
Pos, I am definitely not a Ford girl  Everyone I have ever known who has owned a Ford has called it a nightmarish experience  Then there are the cute acronyms    quot Found On Road Dead quot  or  quot Fix Or Repair Daily quot  This past week  however  I drove a car that might start to change my mind  I had the delight of driving a 2000 Ford Focus  If I were to ever break down and purchase a Ford  this would have to be the car for me When I first sat in the car  it looked like the interior of a jet  The dash board is designed so that all the controls for the air conditioning and the radio as within a comfortable reach of the arm  Therefore  the driver need not lean in anyway to adjust the radio or control the temperature  Often when people lean with their bodies inside the car to do anything  they accidentally steer the car in that direction  Not needing to lean over to make these adjustments may avoid an accident The gas pedal offers just the right amount of tension  The driver need not press the pedal all the way to the floor just to go sixty  but it is not so sensitive that you sneeze and  poof  your doing 110  The overdrive control button is on the gear shift  This was a new one to me because I had never even heard of overdrive before  The chairs were designed for the ultimate in comfort  The seat on the driver s chair has a crank which allows you to adjust the seat back to the correct position for you using the minimalist of adjustment  The steering wheel telescopes as well as tilts  The turn signals are fairly quiet and unobtrusive  so you are not stuck at a light with your turn signal on hearing an annoying  quot CLICK  CLICK  CLICK quot  The light which illuminates the dash board is soft and not glaring  The head lights are adjusted using a dial on the dash to the driver s left  which change the lights from off  to parking lamps  to head lights  The brights come on by clicking the turn signal wand toward you once  On most 1999 compacts  I could not even find the control for the brights  Another light control which is usually difficult for me to find is the hazards  On the Ford Focus  the hazard lights are controlled by a button on the dash  right above the radio where you cannot miss it  The car s gas tank fills with about  11  The trunk has a phenomenal amount of room  The cabin is large enough so that my boyfriend who is 6 8 quot  could sit comfortably The car has many safety feature  too  It comes with air bags  It also comes with special anchors along the top of the back seat to better secure a child s safety seat  It has a gear lock   a safety feature which allows you to lock the gears so that you cannot move the car out of park with out pressing down on the break first  The trunk has a latch on the inside that allows you to pop the trunk if you should get locked inside it  This is a safety feature I think that any person with children should look for in a car It also comes equipped with quite a few luxury items which I never knew existed  but now want in every car I own  It has a clear digital mileage display  The top display is the amount of miles you traveled that day  and the bottom display is the total miles traveled  The cabin light does not just turn off suddenly   it fades to black  The radio has an option that allows it to become louder when the engine revs  and softer as the car slows down so that you can always hear your radio comfortably  The air conditioning system does not just go from hot to cold  but has many subtle levels in between Allot of thought was put into every aspect of the Ford Focus  This car was a dream to handle  maneuvered easily  and was a joy to drive  I do not think I even scratched the surface  but for the six days I had the car  I practically lived in it  If I could find a car that even equals the Ford Focus  I might get it  But  in the end  I think I may just have to break down and buy this car br br  
Pos, I managed to get ahold of the keys for a new 2000 model year Ford Focus ZX3  Honestly  I wasn t sure what to expect from this car  I d seen small Fords before  specifically the Escort  and remembered that that vehicle was characterized by a bare bones interior  very little power  and sloppy handling  The Ford Focus blew most of my expectations out of the water It s equipped with a rather gutsy 2 liter Zetec four cylinder  The engine is reasonably quick to respond  and provides good acceleration for a car of this class and price range  Stopping power was handled by front disc rear drum brakes  and the vehicle stopped reliably  However  the pedal feel was too spongy for my liking  and the car as a whole felt rather dull as far as powertrain The car s transmission shifted well  but hunted a bit for gears and hesitated slightly when power was demanded of it  While acceptable for a car of this class  it s not a sportster by any means However  the handling is an entirely different story  The car rides on 15 quot  diameter wheels  with low profile tires  Alloy wheels are standard on this model  and the split five spoke design fits the car quite well  without drawing too much attention to them  The car s handling is very crisp and precise  The power rack and pinion steering is well weighted  providing enough resistance to feel just right  without being overboosted  The car has a very sprightly  nimble feel to it that most people will enjoy  especially in a car of this class The interior is actually reasonably equipped  The front buckets are comfortable  but I wouldn t want to be stuck in them for more than a few hours  Rear seat room is typically cramped  as is rear headroom  Front headroom  however  is not a problem  Front legroom  on the other hand  is  The seat could use another inch or two of travel  as even pushed all the way back  it was just not far back enough  and my knee brushed against the steering column  A tilt wheel is an option  and one I reccomend you get  Otherwise  the guages could be obstructed by the steering wheel  The radio controls in this car are fairly large  and easy to use  This car had the CD stereo  and it sounded fairly good  with some distortion at high volumes  However  there s quite enough power in the stock unit to overcome most road noise  Not that there is much  For a compact car  this vehicle has a well behaved  quiet ride  Highway irregularities are for the most part ignored  and only the bigger stuff gets really noticed  Again  they ve dialed in just a little bit of that feel that makes a good car great This is a solid  well rouned economy car  that is also a good budget enthusiast s car  With spirited handling and a reasonably comfortable interior  this Ford s not a bad choice at all br br  
Pos, I bought the Focus because of the overall value and quality of the car  My Focus came with all the options except a cd changer and it was under 15 grand  I love how the car handles and rides  I had a Mercury Mystique before the Focus and this car is so much more refined in the ride and comfort of all passengers  The only complaint I have about the suspension of the vehicle is that when riding over dips over the road sometimes there is a thump sound from the front of the car  The powertrain of my Focus came with the 130 horsepower 2 0 liter Zetec four cylinder mated to a 5 speed manual tranny that motivates the car pretty good  The tranny is matched perfect with the engine  providing pretty good acceleration in all gears  The seats are very supportive and comfortable on long trips  The design of the dash is ergonomic and it looks good  everything is where it should be  within easy reach from the driver s seat and the tilting telescoping steering wheel is a nice addition  There are three cupholders in the Focus  one in the back of the center console for a rear passenger  and two up front  The front cupholders are allright for soda cans and bottles  but don t try to put a big gulp in them because the dash hangs down too low  Trunk space is a very respectable 13 cubic feet and the fuel tank holds 13 2 gallons which will give you an estimated range of 330 miles in town based on 25 miles per gallon and 448 miles on the highway based on 34 miles a gallon  The sound system in the Focus is surprisingly good considering that all four of the speakers are in the doors  you can turn the volume up and the speakers will not distort  Overall  I love my Focus  and for the money you get a whole lot of car br br  
Pos, I had the opportunity to rent a 5 door Focus in Germany earlier this year  I drove it from Cologne down to Mannheim and back twice  and also hit the twisties along the Mosel river  The car is excellent  Absolutely no wind noise  very little road noise  and decent if not abundant  power  The car easily cruises at 90   100 mph even in the uphill sections  The car also does a respectable job in the stoplight grand prix if the competition is not to stout  I can only confirm what has already been written about the handling  even with the skinny rental tires It is too bad that the 5 door apparently isn t sold here in the US  It is the best version with the versatility of the 4 doors with the styling of the coupe  The driving position fit this 6 4 quot  240 pounder perfectly I also rented a 4 door sedan with auto trans here in the US  Other than the expected lack of grunt with the auto I found this version a superb car br br  
Pos, I am not generally a fan of small cars  especially the four door econobox variety  I am a fairly good sized person and like my space when I drive  My wife is a fan of small cars but shares my opinion about the  quot cookie cutter quot  sameness of the majority of sub compact offerings available today  The one thing we do agree on is  quot four cylinders 5 speeds quot  No slushboxes allowed in our vehicles  We both expect a vehicle to perform and have a reasonable level of over  the road comfort  On a whim  we recently stopped at a Ford dealer who had a number of Focus cars on the lot  I had looked at the four door model before and was not impressed enough to drive one since they had all contained automatic transmissions  What caught my eye this time was the one vehicle that had two doors  a manual transmission and a very non conforming appearence  We took a drive in the ZX3 and it was love at first sight  The car has what I consider to be a very European appearence  no glitz  everything is where it is for a reason  The vehicle accelerates and handles far out of expectation to it s sticker price  Finally  the seat was more confortable than the standard size car we had just test  driven at another dealer  I did not feel confined and my wife did not have the big car blues  Bottom line is that the Focus ZX3 is the pick of the litter in the low cost  small car class  we bought it     
Pos, In June we bought the Sony Limited Edition Focus SE 4 DR Sedan  Simply put this is one great little car  We have the vehicle equipped with AT  PS PB  PW  PDL  CC  Tilt Wheel  Comfort Group  Sport Group  Alarm w  Keyless Entry  and the AWSOME Sony Xplod Stereo  The Sony Limited Edition Focus is a Limited Production of 7000 Vehicles  and comes in AT  amp  5 spd  and is only available in four color choices  Green  Black  Infa Red   amp  Going Platinum  with the last being unique only to the Sony Edition  The Sony Xplod has a CD Head unit w  30 pre sets  a CD Player w  remote  and a 450 watt Amplifier  amp  12 quot  Sub Woofer mounted in the trunk  It is one awsome stereo  and will drive you out of the vehicle if you really crank it up  I have never heard such a wonderful clear sound in a vehicle until we bought this Sony Focus  I would really recommend this to anyone who loves music  all comes wrapped in a great vehicle The vehicle itself is very roomy  extremely comfortable in both front and back  and plenty of legroom too  The car handles and drives like a much more expensive vehicle  We had a 1997 Camry that did not ride or drive any where near as nice as the Focus  We got the Z Tec Engine as part of the Sport Group  and would say that would the engine i would recommend  It puts out 130 hp  and is plenty powerful for 4 Adults in the car  and even on hilly terrain  The only bad thing about the car is the poorly designed and placed cupholders  They sit on either side and in front of the Gear Shift Lever  This leaves little room to reach a cup  and is very limiting to size of cup as well  Not a huge issue to an otherwise Great Little Car  It was also announced this week  that the Focus is top selling car in the world  To go along with all the awards  all I have to say is watch out Toyota and Honda  here comes the Ford Focus br br  
Pos, After 140 000 miles  we decided to replace my wife s 1990 Toyota Camry  We found the new Camrys to be overpriced  offering essentially 1990 technology with seats that weren t as adjustable or as comfortable as the old ones  So we started shopping around Much to our amazement  we ended up buying a Ford Focus station wagon with the ZTEC engine  This car is amazing It is the easiest car to get in and out of and has great seats  really important if you have a bad back  The doors open wide  the seats sit high  and the car has a high roof line   the seating couldn t be much better  I m 6 5 quot  and can sit with inches to spare between the top of my head and the roof  My wife is 5 7 quot  and can adjust the seat to fit her perfectly  The seats offer great support  too  They seem to have just the right amount of firmness and are designed to help you sit properly  without slouching  There is plenty of room in the back seat  too The  quot trunk quot  door height is just perfect for loading things  This is the first car we have owned that makes it easy to load groceries  The car is loaded with features   electric windows  locks  trunk door release  cruise control  mirrors  CD player  power brakes  tilt steering wheel  automatic transmission  center arm rest  cup holders  filtered air HVAC system  etc  The interior light stays on after you leave the car  and then gradually dims and shuts off The design and placement of the instruments and controls  and even the dashboard vents  couldn t be better  Ford really took consumers into account when this car was designed The car is inexpensive to operate  It gets about 28 MPG on regular gasoline  The car handles extremely well  The steering is precise with good road feedback  The brakes are ABS front disks and rear drums  and in our experience offer good stopping  And the 15 quot  tires aren t Firestone  The transmission is as smooth as you can find  The finish and fit are both excellent The car has a few disadvantages but I would not call them problems  Even with the ZTEC engine it s not as powerful as I would like  but it s more responsive than the four cyl  Camry that we replaced  The car tends to be a little noisy  The manual seat adjusters take a little getting used to  Ford does not have a sunroof option  The radio sound system is on the boomy side  There have been two recalls since we bought the car  an inconvenience to deal with In summary  the Focus station wagon is a real bargain for most anyone  We have owned Toyotas  Acuras  Hondas  VWs  Cadillacs  Buicks  and Oldsmobiles  This is our first Ford and it is without a doubt the best value for the money we have ever seen in an automobile     
Pos, The Ford Focus is a great little record setting car  It is the first car to ever win North American Car of the Year  and European Car of the Year awards  And it definitely deserves it  This car is the same overall length as the Escort  but the wheelbase is about 5 inches longer  This means that the cabin is extremely roomy  The roof is high  enabling the driver to sit up higher  and provide more room  in every direction  Designed in Europe  it is extremely easy for older people to use  The Ford staff designed a suit which made the wearer feel more elderly  This made it possible for them to design a car that is more friendly to older drivers  This car also looks awesome  The  quot new edge quot  design that Ford uses gives this car a clean  sporty  distinctive look  It is hard to figure out which of the models  sedan  wagon  ZX3 coupe  looks the best  but the wagon is definitely very functional  Ford has scratched plans for an MPV vehicle  and will probably not build a coupe model  It is possible that the new Volvo S40 and V50 will be built on this platform  but this isn t definite  Overall  this car is a steal  It is cheap and gives you a lot of  quot car quot  It was given the revered  quot Automobile of the Year quot  status  and is great for any kind of person with a low budget for a car  If the looks don t hook you  the drive will  I recommend the ZX3 model because it is the cheapest and has the most standard features  2 0 zetec engine at about 130 bhp  CD player standard  etc  In the month of July  the Focus was the 10th best selling vehicle in America with about 30 000 units  The only real down side to the Focus is the interior  In my opinion  it could have been made much nicer  The buttons feel a little fragile  The seats are great  but the headrests are terrible  My  96 Nissan Sentra has a very nice interior  it is simple and durable  Overall  the Focus is a great car  and it leads the class in almost every way br br  
Pos, I needed a new car because my hyundai excel 91 had it so I decided to shop around for a nice small car with a affordable price tag I wasn t really thinking about american car because of all the negative talk I was thinking more of a Honda Accord Nissan Altima jetta So I went to the closest car place which so happens to be  quot Ford quot  so I browsed around for a bit see what I would like quot I just knew I wasn t going to see nothing I like and there it was a car I thought ford didn t make a car that stood out from the rest of their cars the  quot Focus quot This car was really different when I looked inside the window and saw the inside and saw how spacious it was for a small car so I said to myself they probably want alot for this car I looked at the ticket price and said I have to have this car  quot this is in my budget quot I love the roomy interior and easy the controls are to reach The way the seats feel is very comfortable I m not to found of the lumbar when it is lowered too low it leaves a big space it needs a little more horsepower though It rides nicely on the streets but rough going up a steep hill it s very comforting driving a long ride when the seat is up it makes you feel on the same level of a  quot SUV quot  This is certainly a great economical car I think anybody who is looking for a small affordable car with a midsize car feel once you sit inside you will love the car br br  
Pos, The 2000 Ford Focus SE 4 door sedan has a spacious interior and a solid feel  I m the only person in my neighborhood to own one  and nearby friends and acquaintances regularly ask me how this stylish and affordable car performs Among the first things I tell them is to spend a little extra money and buy a Focus model that includes the perky 16 valve Zetec engine  This adds several hundred dollars to the purchase price  but the investment is worth it if you value passing performance on the freeway and climbing ability on hills  I drove 2000 and 2001 models with the underpowered standard engine and came away disappointed  Zetec is definitely the way to go Ford engineered the Focus to provide a roomy interior and did so with great success  My head always bumped the ceiling in my Escort  the car I traded when I bought the Focus in November 2000  Head rattling is not an issue with the Focus  Seat height is adjustable  and leg room for a person of my height  6 ft  is more than ample  Front seat passengers gain the most from the cab forward design  Passengers in the rear may feel a bit squeezed if passengers in the front use the maximum amount of legroom My Focus came with a CD player and AM FM radio  Sound quality is not concert like  but I didn t expect it to be  I d rate it better than adequate I ve read a number of reviews that said the Focus was  fun  to drive  Let me jump on that bandwagon  too  Steering is responsive and the car  which has 15 inch tires  hugs the road One caution to prospective purchasers  read the manual  The Focus comes with several design features that initially may create the appearance of being minor malfunctions  One of these is the air conditioning light that signals the air conditioning is in use  During certain times  this light comes on automatically as part of a design feature that  apparently  dehumidifies the air in the car to minimize frosting  I ve read some reviews in which people didn t read the owner s manual and reported a suspected malfunction of the air conditioning unit The styling on the Focus also appeals to me  and to my inquisitive neighbors  The SE model I own has power windows and door locks  keyless entry  tilt wheel  cruise control and other options  Gas mileage is about 32 on the highway   not great  but good  Trunk room is surprisingly adequate One small problem is that the cup holders can t accommodate large beverages  Another problem is that the car doesn t seem well insulated against road noise Hey  I regularly drive a Saturn and a Toyota Corolla  The Focus beats them readily in performance  interior room and value  I am very pleased with this purchase
